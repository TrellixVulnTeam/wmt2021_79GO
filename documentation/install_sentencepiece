# Notes on how to install sentencepiece command line tools

# Follow the directions in https://github.com/google/sentencepiece, but instead of doing sudo make install (which I can't do, because I don't have sudo privileges), do

vim cmake_install.cmake

# Update line 5:
set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "/home/gianghl2/.local") on line 5 of file cmake_install.cmake of the build dir.

# Export export MY_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local in ~/.bashrc and then source.

# Finally, run make install
