Driving in Heels is dangerous!
Multipnoid (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
Conduct of violations that usually touch the traffic law.
It is a big mistake to think that it's only an older driver, although there are reports of error operations, such as pedals.
By the age of 24, more than 1080 people in the 2015 Police Agency's data show that there are more than 1032 people over 75 years of age.
It is important to call attention as well as the young age group, not to be a lot of people.

In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by high heels, panps, sandals, mulls and costumes of the day and drive them.
Some people are concerned that they are not suitable for driving, but they don't think they can lead to danger, and many are driving.
However, driving in high heels and sandals usually touch road traffic laws.
One is to "operate the handle, brakes and other operations," Article 70 "The safety and safety obligations violations shall not be required to drive the victims of accidents."
Another is that the driver must comply with the requirements of each prefecture's Public Safety Commission, Article 71 of the "Law Concerning the compliance of the Public Safety Board," etc.
In each prefecture, it is similar to that of "the wearing of clothes that may prevent driving operations."
Why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious if you consider the basics of the pedal operation safely.
For safety-safe pedal operation, the foot is fixed first or down to the floor, and the foot will be vertically vertical to the brake pedal and turn right on the foot.
At this time, it is important to keep the car's behavior firmly or not to be blobed.
However, in high heels, the area is smaller and the area surrounding the floor is always smaller, and the height of the heel is always blobed and blobed, so the area of the pedal is small, fine adjustment is less.
This is considered to lead to danger.
In most cars, the floor carpet is covered, but it can be easy to pull the high heels into this material, and the pedals were not pulled up when the pedals were pulled off, and the heels were pulled off.
In addition, there is also a case that heel pedals were pulled behind the pedal, and the pedals were not returned.

There are few creators who are not allowed to accept the presence of YouTuber in their family, as well as post creators.
This initiative provides the environment for pay and content production for creators who are adopted.
At first, I would like to support the activities by supporting the professional advantage of YouTuber that would be insecure.

[The first half of the Bad Olympic race] The world king, Mr. Momota, lead a step forward of success!
"Bado × Spi!
Japan won six medals at the Big Event in Badminton in August, the 25th World Championships (Switzerland Basel) in the early September, and the China Open (Selected State/Super 1000).
Here, we will see the men's singles for the mid-season (September and December) while the Olympic race was first in Tokyo from May to August.
The badminton Olympic race started in May was the highest tournament (Super 500 or more).
In the first half of the year, he won 4 games in the first half of the year, and two of the three won the championship.
Momota won the World Championships, Zhou Tensei won the World Ranking Point, which connects to the Indonesian OP (S1000) and the Olympic race.
Momota also has a JapanOP (S750) system.
The tournament will be held in May (May/China) in Indonesia's OP (July/last 16).
Although there are few other top players, it is probably a schedule of reducing their burden to the body.
August was only a World Championship 1 tournament, but it would not be much more fatigued than the war.
There is a good result in the second half of the tournament since September.
It is a strong Taiwan Ace.
Young people in Thailand are also noted!
At the top of the Indonesian OP and ThailandOP (S500), the race was already 7 games.
He also competed in the local TaipeiOP (S300) in September and won the competition.
Originally, the sport is very strong and won't suffer the fight.
There is no major problem in the performance of the game.
However, by winning a high point in the first half of the year, the schedule of the tournament will be easier to adjust.
It was not until last year that the chronogenousness had been the impression of the explosion, but this year the stableness of the play was increased.
In the world rankings, it is more than anyone else than ever.
I left the results in the first half of the game, but the Thai young Ace Cantaphone and Indian Cy Planet B.
And it's a 3rd player of Unders Antonensen, who is fighting an isolated army in Europe.
The Cantaphones are not in the top tournament finals, but the best 4 in the second half of the season is the highest.
Even though there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old) that the rally can be used for top players and vs. others is very likely to leap into the Olympic race.
Also, Cy Planet B. passed a step away in India with the favorite players in singles.
Smir Barama, Planet H.S., and Slican Kidambi, who is late in Kega, is also required to be careful in the middle of the war.
New charges of mobile A value reduction in competitive competition: How to do this?
The new price plan for a mobile phone company was enacted in October.
However, it was a very high halt.
Mr. Masashi Kan said, "There are about 40% of the room" last summer, even though the expectations were high, the price competition was not.
The full-fledged entry of the heavens is a major factor, which continues to remain in the third of the major.
With a fair competition for consumers, the rate system that is easy to use is desirable.
I would like to ask for the help of a mobile company.
The revised law prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the device, the communication fee was set to be reduced.
SOFTBANK and KDDI (O) have announced plans to make the device up to half a month.
However, the two companies are using the "IMRock" that is not used for 100 days.
NTT Do Como takes up to 1/3 of the device for only one of its own lines.
3 companies also show that they are still in the direction of "slipsing" to prevent the transfer from other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a policy that requires immediate release.
The companies also need to respond quickly.
The postponement of the heavens was not to proceed as planned for the development of communication networks such as the base station.
It was only expected to be a blaster of value-down competition.
Is there any sweetness of the outlook?
At the start of the full service, the price is not disclosed.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work with the company.
The revision of the charge was made by Mr. Kan.
Mr. Kan said, "I think the future competition has started."I don't think it's a good idea.
However, the "decision value" does not seem to stimulate the market and promote healthy competition.
The company should develop a customer's competitive competition before the government is mouthed.
The rate system of each company is very complicated and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention, as the case of the consumer's burden on consumers is over half the amount of the amount of advertising, such as "up to half".
The company must be able to make sure that it is easy to understand and understand the misunderstanding of users.

What is the way to prevent dementia and keep in mind about "what"?
Interviews, Statements and Watanabe (Izu Shimoda)
The leading pharmaceutical and university hospitals challenge R&D to prevent dementia.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been found to be extremely mild, and it may be possible to keep in mind.
I heard about Mr. Yoshisuke Ohsuke at the University of Tsukuba.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation? – prevention of dementia or treatment awaits?
Otsuki From mildness to severity, the difference is that everyone may become dementia when they are older.
However, it is believed that more than 20 years to be developed for new dementia drugs.
In some countries around the world, the drug used in Japan is already outside the insurance adaptation and cannot expect significant completion effects.
On the other hand, while mortality by infectious diseases and accidents has declined, the death of cancer is also likely to live longer while declining in treatment, including anticancer drugs.
This is also true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not only possible to resolve their own or family, but it is necessary to make a living environment in a whole society.
How to keep in mind about "
What is the person who is easy to become dementia?
Otsuki There is a possibility that it can be kept as much as possible, even if it is inevitable to become dementia.
dementia is considered as one of the life habits, and tends to be easy to people.
First, the metabo people tend to be dementia-friendly.
dementia is taken as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the economy.
For example, the United States has distributed food tickets to the poor, but food tickets are available in the food ticket, Hanberg, Pizza and Chicken.
Gas can't be used, and people living in a environment where food is not available.
Then, the vegetables and starches are eaten, and they are separated into lipids and sugars.
As a result, the poor will be obese, and the only thing to watch the television is that the body will be free.
There is also a similar situation in Japan.
Other, it tends to be easy for those who do not think about things and not work.
That is, to prevent dementia, you must read books and think about things around the day.
