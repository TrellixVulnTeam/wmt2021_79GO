Driving in high heels is dangerous!
A lot of people's pedal accident (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
Acts that violate the road traffic law.
It's a big mistake to think that it's only a problem with older drivers, although it's attracting attention to the increasing number of reports of accidents due to malfunctions such as pedal stepping errors.
The number of accident occurrences (2015 National Police Agency data) is more than 1080 times less than 24 years old, and more than 1032 people aged 75 or more.
The mistake is not a lot of elderly people, and it is important to attract attention to the younger generation as well.
Do you take a leg oshawle?
Do you take safety?
This data does not include gender ratio or cause, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from the body's depression, such as driving skills and reflective nerves, it may be a mistake due to other things, such as music and conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose a wide variety of shoes by high heels, breadps, sandals, mulls, and clothes on the day and drive them intact.
There are some people who know that they don't need to wear, but some people don't think of the possibility to lead to danger, and there are many people who are driving without fear.
However, driving in high heels and sandal usually touches the road traffic law.
One is to ensure that the handle, brake and other operations operate reliably. Article 70 "Disclosures safety driving obligations violations" as stipulated in Article 70, "Do not harm people in an accident."
Another thing is that the driver must adhere to the matters set by the Provincial Public Safety Committee in Article 71 of the "Disclosurement of the Public Safety Committee" which stipulates that the operator must comply with the conditions set by each prefecture's Public Safety Commission.For example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Act, there is a sentence that prevents the wear of the footwear and other operation of the vehicle.
The purpose of each prefecture is to consider the violation of the operation in "the footwear that is likely to interfere with the operation of the operation."
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious if you think about the basics in making pedal operation safely.
For safe pedal operation, you can first fix the foot or the floor, and put the foot vertically on the brake pedal, and turn it to the right side of the foot as a stepping point.
At this point, it is important to keep cars in mind, regardless of the car's behavior, or to keep them firm and firm.
However, in high heels, the area of the floor is small, and always gratula and bres, and the area of the foot to the foot with the height of the heels makes it easier to adjust.
This is considered to lead to danger.
There is also a floor carpet on the car, but this material makes it easy to pull the high heels, and the heel pulls the pedal, and the heel pulls off, and the heel pulls off the pedal, and you can't take the pedal back.
In addition, when you walk through the pedal, the heap pulls the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedals will not return.

Gundo Island's land area industry, "Waji Ceramics" manufacturing application for quasi-self-resolved debt about 20 billion yen (Economic Data Bank) - Yahoo! News
"The roof of the consumer" has been affected by the sluggishness of housing and the damage of the earthquake.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporate Code: 530173983, capital money 9920 million yen, Otani 881-8, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative Fukuhara Yukizo, and 44 employees) filed their own bankruptcy on August 30.

The company was founded in June 1895, and was reorganized in April 1961 (Showa 36).
Initially, we started our business as a brick manufacturer, a land area industry in Mihara-ku-machi (now Minami-Aizu city) in Kinki-Kenga Kogyo.
In October 86, the company acquired the absorber of the cowa kiln business, and joined the business of Kinki Industrial Co., Ltd., and moved to the current location.
After this operation, we opened sales offices in Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Oita, Miyazaki, and other locations, and the current structure was based on the change of consumer needs.
We built a wide range of sales bases in Nishi-Japan center, such as leading house manufacturers, construction trading companies, roof construction companies, and other construction companies.In December 2004, we recorded about 31 million yen of annual sales.
I had a good reputation as a brick manufacturer of the island top.
However, demand for residential areas after the Lehman shock, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake caused a rise in demand due to the damage of consumer's roof.The annual sales of the fiscal year ended in December 2018 fell to about 134 million yen.
In terms of profitability, we had a continuous deficit with excess equity debt associated with inventory and capital investment in addition to the drop in profitability associated with fuel prices.
For this reason, financial institutions asked for repayment conditions for their loans, etc. to rebuild their business, but there was no signs of recovery in business conditions.
I came here to support the project and decided to continue.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

Is there an image that YouTuber is going to post videos independently?Why did you decide to "use"?

In this effort, we will provide the environment for the creators employed to pay and create content.
At first, we believe that we will support our activities by supporting the disadvantages of YouTuber, which will become unstable.

[The first race of the Bud Games] The world's king, Momoda, and a strong race!
Men's singles!
Japan won six medals at the Budominton Big Event, the 25th World Championship (Switzerland Basel) held in August, finishing in the early September, and participating in China's OP (U.S./Super 1000) that will open from 17th.
Here, we will look back to the first half of the race from May to August next year to the Tokyo Olympics, and we will explore singles towards the mid-term (September to December).
The badminton marathon began in May, and ended the World Championship, where the top players will compete at the top (super 500 or more).
In the first half of the year, I played a key role in the first half of the game, and I would like to win the 4th championship, and two of the Taiwanese Zhoutian (Chang Tienchen).
Momota won the World Championship and Zhou Tensei won the Indonesian OP (S1000) and the world ranking points that are directly connected to the Olympic race.
In addition, the company also has a Japan OP (S750) system.
The tournament that has participated in since May is the fourth tournament of the World Championship (May/China), Indonesia OP (July 16 bull), JapanOP (July) and the World Championship (August).
There are fewer times compared to other top players, but it is probably a schedule to keep the burden on the body.
In August, only one of the world championships was the only one in the world, it would not be much more fatigue than during the war.
The top competitions from September to September require a positive result in the mid-term.
Taiwan Ace with strong fighting.
I'm also interested in young Thai!
As well as the top competitions of Indonesia OP and Thai OP (S500), she has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the spot.
Originally a figical high, players who don't struggle against the battle.
There is no big problem in the performance of the game even after the tournament continues.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by earning high points in the first half.
Although it was an impression that Zhou Tensei had no explosive power until last year, it has been a steady feeling of playing this year, so it has been able to continue with strong positive grades.
For the world's first-largest peaches, it seems to be a bit more disappointed than ever.
He left the results in the first half of the game, except for the two players, with the young Ace Kantaphones in Thailand and Cy-Place B in India.
And it's three players from Unders Antonsen, who is struggling as a whole in Europe.
The Cantaphones have no choice but to enter the finals at the top, but now they will enter the Best 4 in the second half of the season.
There is still a rough side, but with top players, the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who could be rallying against, it seems that there is a great possibility to leap in the race.
In addition, Cy-Panys B. was a step away in India with a good player in singles.
Sammy Rosema, Planety H.S., and Slicans Kidabi, who are late in the Kega, will be in the future, but only after the mid-term battle, you must be careful.
New rates of mobiles The price drop in fair competition: Hokkaido Newspapers What are you doing?
The new price plan for a cell phone company following the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Act in October came out.
However, it was a high stop.
"There is a room to drop about 40%" last summer, and despite the high expectations for the price drop, the price race did not happen.
The full-scale entry of the Rakuten is the destination, and it remains a major factor in the existence of 3 major companies.
For consumers, it is desirable to be a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I would like to request the efforts of the mobile company.
The amended law prohibits a set of terminals and communications charges.
Instead of selling the device instead of selling it, the communication fee was set to be a high price.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to a maximum of half.
However, the two companies also have a mechanism to use the "SIM Lock" which cannot be used for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will make up a maximum of 3 minutes for only the subscribers of its own line.
We will continue to show that we are continuing to prevent transfer to other companies.
Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy to ensure that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is obliged to cancel immediately.
The company also needs to respond quickly.
The delays in the paradise were because the construction of the communication network such as the base station was not progressing as planned.
"It's just a little bit like it was expected to be a blaster of a lower price.
I think there was a lot of sweetness on the outlook.
The start times and charges of full-scale service have not been clarified.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we want to work with our business with responsibility.
The change in the price was the result of Mr. Kan's remarks.
Mr. Kan expressed his frustration that "I think that the competition will start in the future," he said.
However, the "manufacturer's price" seems to relax the market and promote healthy competition.
The corporate side should expand the customer base competition before the government is mouthed out.
The fee system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
When a device has been advertising such as "up to half", the consumer's burden exceeds a half-price.
The company itself needs to try to explain the user's misunderstanding to be honest and understandable.

[Branding W Cup] 1 Department & War Fight "The Face Dangerous Tuckle" by U.S. players "The insult and humble play" - Yahoo!
The U.S.FL would play rafts, and the former British representative "Tuckle" is not called.
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was the last appearance in the 20 countries in the world, and the United States lost 7-45 in England.
It became a black star, but in the second half, a raff play played by FL John Quill called a ripple.
On the side of the opponent's face, you can add a Chorder tattoo.
The actual scene is also published with video, and the former England players are "extremous and modest play" "It's not a tattoo."
[Video] "The insult and humble play" and Overseas Waves!
One outage, two military players are in a mess ... the real moment when the US representative Cuil played "face-like dangerous tackle".
The hot challenge was over one line.
At 0-38, the second half of the time I was invited.
The enemy was deeply in balance when the British commander Farrell caught their paths.
I went to Tuckle to this, but it was cred.
However, it caused an upper body rather than from the waist, and violently put on the upper body.
Results, the head and head of the opponent's head contact and look at the shape they are.
Farrell was violently blown and fell down.
In the play that apparently lacks legitimacy, the English player will have a crush on it.
Both military players gathered at once and became an air with a touch.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), the cred is a red card and is dropped away.
But after the pitch in the face of badness, some of the participants asked for a fair play, and some of them were asked to boot.
Rugby New Zealand's local media " Staff" is a special feature of Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players are going to leave in a modest play, England's pleasure and headlines.
"Cirrus made a decent shoulder charge on the face of the British starfare and became a retreat," he reports.
In the article, we introduced a comment on the former England player, the Ougo Moña.
"It's an insult, and it's not called a tacru.It's a humble play," he said.
The game had one person in the United States, which was 81 minutes away from the U.S., managed to escape the loss.
However, the play of Quill left the evil of the later taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first of the 424 hospital names that were judged to be "no clinical record" among public hospitals such as 1455 public hospitals and sun red.
In the prefecture of Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health and Labor verifies the treatment achievements of 14 facilities at the public hospital.There are four facilities in the town of Odaotai Hospital in front of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Station.
⇒Responsibility of "standard" in the four hospitals in the field of reorganization
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding in the elderly, we had to promote restructuring and integration with hospitals in the conflict area.
In October, we asked for a full-scale review of the hospital's restructuring and integration, and decided to conclude it by September next year.
There is no compulsory force, but there is a possibility of repulsion of local chiefs and residents from the anxiety that a familiar hospital will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
A total of 29 and 1% of hospitals had a relatively small number of beds.
In the prefecture, Niigata (53-7 %), Hokkaido (48-6 percent), Miyagi (47-5%), Yamaguchi (46-7 %), Okayama (43-3%).
The total number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on the data of the fiscal year 2017, the Ministry of Health investigates 1455 hospitals in order to respond to the acute term for patients with severe acute acute acuteness, among public and public hospitals.
With 9 fields of medical care, such as cancer and emergency medicine, the conflict hospital analyzed whether it is within 20 minutes by car and decided to announce the need for hospital name.
The hospital is subject to consideration for the removal of the hospital and some of the clinics being transferred to other hospitals.
The medical cost surged in 25 years, which is 75 years of age or more of the total mass generation.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds in 124,6 thousand beds in the country in 18 years.
Currently, there are a lot of beds in "high-accuracy acute" or "acute" beds that help nurses put their hands and pay for medical care.
To cope with the aging, we need to reduce the number of beds simply and increase rehabilitation.
In relation to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has formulated a "regional medical plan" that sets the number of beds needed for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 areas across the country, and the local governments and medical officials discuss, but many local residents and leaders maintain a cautious attitude and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health and Labor wants to revitalize the debate by publishing a number of hospital names with no record.

The recommended area of the pig cholera vaccine is the Ministry of Agriculture (Gifu Newspaper Web) - Yahoo! News
On 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries released an amendment to the Epidemiology Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Bit (Yan) cholera" infection.
The target area is a policy to select 9 prefectures, such as Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which has been identified by pigs and wild inosis.
The migrations such as vaccined living pigs and fertilized eggs are limited in the region, but the distribution of meat and processing products outside the region is recognized.
After a public comment on the general public, such as a public opinion application, we aim to complete the process in October.
By using vaccines, recognizing the distribution of meats and other areas, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since last September, Japan has been in a state where the status of cleanliness has been temporarily pending.
Based on the opinion of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture set the "Vaccinate recommended areas" based on the view of the areas where wild inosis is high in the pig.
The prefecture will create a vaccine program that summarizes the range of vaccinations, duration, head number, and progress, and will be able to use it in the governor's judgment.
Other 7 prefectures that have been designated as a recommended area are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the area has been amended, the situation will be determined very again.
Transfers such as vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, waste, etc. are limited in principle to the region.
For meat and processing products, it is not subject to the cost or the impact of farmers on distribution restrictions, and it is practically unacceptable to distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
We are also working to sue the safety of the infected pig and prevent wind damage.
The amendments to the Guidelines were summarized at an open-minded meeting on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Epidemi Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, we will conduct opinion meetings and public comments to the prefecture until October 7, and enforce the new epidemiological guidelines.
A public approach to Honda Kei and Manu!
"We don't need money" (the football channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Saturday) 2:57 delivery
As far as the last season, I left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and now my former Japan's MF Honda came to an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda actually came to the match?
The truth of heaven is revealed.
"We don't need money, but you must play with a great team or a great team," says Honda, who has updated their own Twitter on the 27th of the day.
The other person who sent "inverter" is Manchester United, the world's name.
Why did Honda have a grand request to the strongest club in the Premier League?
The opportunity is in an article on the Australian version "FOX Sports" published on 24th.
In the article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could grab in the crisis of the injured, five of the players who are currently available are pick up.
There was also the name of Honda in players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi, and Will Freud Bonnie.
Currently, the United has been injured, such as MF Pole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Martin Shard, FW Marcus Rushford, etc.
"Red Devils" led by Ole Gunner Slecherer are forced to take 2 wins and 22 losses in the league and have challenges in the front quality.
That's why Australia's media named it as a candidate for Teco.
In the article, "The contract of Honda as a creative side player, not strictly speaking Striker, can fill the hole that Andreas Perleyra has buried."
The 18-game score in Melbourne Victory is "successful record", but the 33-year-old Honda points out that he needs to take full attention from his entertainment to manage Cambodian representatives.
Do you have the approach of Honda?
I'm also interested in how the United will move for the next year's Tokyo Olympics because of the goal-to-date veteran.

Candy's best shot today.
1W shot is not necessarily a hit.
There is also a skill called "rendola" that you would like to have a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance, such as Par5.
In recent times, 1W has a lot of head volume with the risk of ball scattered, but there are players who often practice this on the ground.
The tour is Ikemura's rebirth who can wait for the first victory.
The 7th year of the Pro 7th year is now the 7th place in the Dry Binding Division, with a height of 166cm and a small pattern.
I was good at long shots, but one of the challenges was a fairwaywood accuracy.
"I thought I would try to do it again because I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W) before spring.
From the practice round, you can put the ball on the grass in the Ti area and cut it off 1W.
In case the big careries are required, you can take advantage of tea-up, but both sides have a narrow hole.
"It's possible to use a hole that will turn down."
In the ballistic instrument, we recorded 270 yd and 280 yd with carry.
"So it doesn't have 3W, so the Caddy can be more comfortable than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood in the Caddy bag only 1W.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
I'm glad that the battle method that can be surprised by tour mates is also the voice of awesome from the gallery.
Do you think that the club will swing to a level?
"I don't hit the top, but I'm going to the right because it's a cut orbit.I'm actually trying to correct a 1W shot swing at the start of the game.
The ball is not caught, but with the risk of a slice, "So the left side will turn off (no turn left).
I say to Kantan, but I think it's a professional skill.

Greta Touli said, "Why are the great guys laughing and threatening children?"
Swedish environmental activist Greta Turnberg, who gave a speech on September 23 at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.
While the speech is attracting attention, it has been sending to insult Greta.
[Twitness] Greta Touli said, "Why are the great people laughing and threatening children?"
The political critic said, "My parents are mentally sick in the American television program, and I've been used to the international leftover," and the TV station I had apologized.
In Japan, it's often used about Greta, "I'm better to go to school" and "I'm going to school," says Greta.
In such a situation, Mr. Greta posted on Twitter on September 26, "Why would the great people use time to laugh and threaten teens, children?"
"It's a lie or conspiracy theory as long as you can think."
Greta says, "Look, also started.As you are curious, people hate me are still active.I look like my clothes, my attitude, and I'm different from people, and I started posting, "they will come up with a lie or conspiracy theory as long as they can think."
And the great people pointed out that they seem to have no argument in the story because they don't want to face climate and environmental crises.
Why the great guys use time to laugh and threaten teens and children in 10 years, honest places, I can't understand.
That time it will be another good thing.
I think that they are threatening us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to awaken.
The change is changing.
Even if you like that change, you don't like it.
Let's meet you on Friday!
On Friday, November 20, a strike on climate change was held around the world, such as New York.

Gulcia's Weddingshot
I thought that I could go in the second half because I was in the first half of the year, but because it was not so good, it was regrettable.
Did you want to win the 6th Eagle, 7th Bardy?
After hitting the boggy in the fourth place, there were also 5 seats, so if I was feeling to return, I had the Chip Ingle at No. 6.
No. 7 also had a chance to get Bardi, but I regret that I was unable to get it in the second half.
What is it that you got to the tournament?
I was glad that the fairway was able to hold a solid key even in a narrow course.
Rough was also a course that had a lot of experience, so I was able to study because I had no experience.
What is the difference between the usual tournament?
(Such as smartphone) What was the possibility of camera shooting?
I didn't care about it at all, but the gallery was filming videos.
There was no other place to change, but there was a few Japanese athletes in the co-organized, so I came to the game with the feeling of "not losing to foreign players."
I'm going to win the second half, but I don't want to win a win because I don't win more than one, so I'd like to win the ZOZO Championship in the near future.
How to prevent dementia from becoming "getting"?
Interviews, sentences, and Watanabe Yang.
A major pharmaceutical and university hospital challenge the research and development of dementia.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been clarified, and it has been known that it could be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital I was told to talk to Prof. Kensuke Otsuki.
There is no dementia.
It is expected to prevent dementia, or prevent therapy, but what is the status quo?
Otsuki From mild to severe, the difference in the degree is that it may be dementia when people age more.
However, it is still considered that it takes more than 20 years to develop a new drug for dementia.
"Donepezil" used in Japan is already outside of the insurance adaptation in some countries outside of Japan, and it is not expected to be outstanding.
On the other hand, while the death of infectious diseases and accidents has declined, cancer deaths have also been declining due to the remarkable advancements in treating anticancer drugs.
This is the fact that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not possible to solve the problem alone or family, and it is necessary to ensure the environment to live safely in the whole community.
How to avoid "getting"?
Is there a person that is prone to dementia, or a person that is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if dementia is inevitable, there is a possibility to suppress the symptoms as much as possible, "get forgotten" degree.
Diagnosis is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases, and it tends to be a person that is easier to become.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
Diagnosis is one of the lifestyle diseases.
The combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the absence of economic power.
For example, the U.S. has a region that distributes food tickets to the poor, but food tickets can be saved in the food ticket, Hanberg, Pizza and Chicken.
Gas can't use electricity, and people living in an environment where no cooking is available.
This is a diet that has little vegetables and protein, and it has become a diet that is biased by lipids and sugar.
At the end, the body becomes unsatisfactory, and the only thing to see the TV is that it is not free.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
In addition, there is a tendency that people who don't work with things are prone to dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, we must not be metabos, and we need to read books from day to day.
