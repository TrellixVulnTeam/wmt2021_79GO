Driving in high heels is dangerous!
There are many accidents (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
A violation of the road traffic law.
It's a big mistake to think that it's only a problem with older drivers, although the report of an accident has increased due to false operation, such as a mistake.
The number of people who had a pedal accident (2015 police station data) was more than 24 years old and 1032 over 75 years.
It is important to call attention in the same way as the young age group.
Do you take the tail of your feet?
Do you take safety?
This data does not include gender ratios and causes, but it is also thought that there are many elderly people who come from the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflection nerves, and other factors such as music and conversation in the younger generation.
There are people who choose a variety of shoes and drive them in the day's clothes, especially women with high heels, breadps, sandals, mulls.
There are many people who know that they don't fit to drive, but they don't think about the possibility that they could lead to danger, and many people who are driving evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals often touches the road traffic law.
One of them is to ensure that the handle, brake and other operations are operated, as defined in Article 70 of the "Secretary of safety driving obligation" as defined in the article.
In Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters set forth by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in accordance with the Road Traffic Law of Miyazaki Prefecture, there is a statement that the vehicle (excluding vehicles) will not be able to operate in a manner that prevent the operation of the operation of the vehicle.
The purpose of each prefecture is to violate the operation of the shoe, which is likely to interfere with the operation of the operation.
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious if you think about the basics on the pedal operation safely.
For safety-proof pedal operation, you can first put your feet on the floor and tilt the leg to the right as the key to the accelerator pedal when you step down.
At this point, it's important to keep the car calm, regardless of the behavior.
However, in high heels, the area is smaller and the area is smaller and the floor is always groomed and the height of the heel and the angle to the entire foot.
This is thought to lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull the high heel, and when the pedal is pulled, such as a sudden brake, the pedal is pulled and the heel is pulled off, and the heel is pulled down and the heel is pulled down, and the pedal can be broken.
In addition, there is also a case that the heel pulls on the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedal has gone back.

Applicant for the application is Yoshida-based lawyer (Nishi-ku, Osaka Prefecture, 1-10-8), Yoshida-land law firm, telephone 0663-6038.
The company was founded in June 1895 (Meiji 28) and was reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.
At the beginning, we started our business as a souvenir manufacturer in Nishiwaki-machi (now Minami-Awaji City) in Nishihara-gun, Kinki-Kenkaku.
At the same time, the company took over the business of Kinki Industry (Thus), which merged into the Japanese kiln business in October86 and moved its main office to the present place.
After that, we opened sales offices in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima, Oita City, and Miyazaki City, and the current system.
We have built a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, such as leading house manufacturers, construction companies, and roof construction companies.In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded about 311,600 million yen.
It has been recognized as the top tiles manufacturer of the island.
However, due to the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand continued to grow due to the decline in housing conditions after the Lehman Shock, and the decline in sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
In addition to the decline in profits due to the surge in fuel prices, the deficit was forced to bear excessive interest due to stock burden and business fixed investment.
For this reason, financial institutions have sought to mitigate the repayment conditions of borrowings, etc., to rebuild their business, but they have no signs of recovery in the business situation and gradually continue to fund.
I came here and refused to continue my business.
The debt is currently being investigated, but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

Men's singles (Badx Spirit).
At the 25th World Championships in Badminton's Big Events in August, the Japanese national team took six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland) to join China's OP (India/Super1000) in early September.
Here, we look forward to seeing men's singles for the mid-term battle (September-December) while the Olympic Games race for the Tokyo Olympic Games began from May to August.
Badminton's Olympic Games, which began in May, have digested four high-level competitions (Super500 or higher) that the top players compete at the end of the World Championship.
He played a strong key in the first half of the season, and two of them were Taota Soto, who won the 4th tournament.
Taota won the World Championship and Zhou Tensei in Indonesia's OP (S1000) and the high points of the World Ranking Points that are directly connected to the Olympic Games.
In addition, the Japanese OP (S750) is also operated.
The tournament, held in May, will be held in Indonesia, OP (July 16th) and JapanOP (July) and the World Championship (August).
Although there are few fewer than other top players, it is likely a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, it was only one tournament in the World Championship, and it would not be much more fatigue than during the war.
A good result is required in the mid-term battle where the higher tournament will continue from September.
Taiwan Aces with strong fighting.
I'm also interested in young Thai people!
He also won the top tournament in Indonesia's OP and ThailandOP (S500).
He also competed in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the prize.
Originally a sporty player, a player who doesn't suffer the battle.
Even after the tournament is held, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming Games by gaining high points in the first half.
She had an impression that she lacked an explosive power until last year, but this year, she was able to continue her best performance because of her increased stability.
For Taota, the world's first place, it seems to be more than ever.
He left the results in the first half of the season except for the two players.
He is also a three-player player of the Unders Anton Sen, who is struggling as a European team.
Cantaphones have won the top, such as entering the best four in the 2nd round of the season.
Even though there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who was able to rally against the top players seems to have a great chance to leap into the Olympic Games.

New charges for mobile phones The price is lower in fair competition: Hokkaido Newspapers What is Shine Electronic Edition
A new fee plan for the mobile phone company was launched in October under the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it was generally stopped.
In the summer of last year, Mr. Masahiro Kan said, "There is a room to lower about 40%" and despite the high expectations for lower price, the price competition did not occur.
It's a big factor that the large three companies have been entering the world.
It is desirable for consumers to become a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I would like to ask for the effort of the mobile company.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on the terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal, the communication fee was set to be high.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced a plan to make the terminal up to half.
However, the "SIM Lock" system, which can not be used for 100 days.
NTT Docomo is one-third of the terminal size for only subscribers of the line.
The three companies will continue to "wind" to prevent the transfer to other companies.
Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated that it is necessary to cancel immediately.
The company also needs to respond quickly.
It was because the construction of communication networks such as the base station was planned.
As expected to be an explosive agent of a lower price, it is just like a shoulder.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
At the start of the full-scale service and the charges are not revealed.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I would like to work with the business.
The price revision took place by Mr. Kan.
Mr. Kan commented on the new charges of three companies, "I think the competition will begin in the future."
However, I don't think that the market will relax and promote healthy competition.
The corporate side should expand the competition of the customer base before being exposed from the government.
The price system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
As the consumer burden exceeds half the amount, the consumer's burden was called by the Consumer Affairs Agency.
We have to make a brief and easy way to explain why we don't make mistakes for users.

The U.S. FLIL played a rough play and the former British representative "Tacru".
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan's final appearance in the 20 countries took place in England on 26th.
It was a black star, but the rough play played by the late Furge was called a ripple.
A dropout in the form of adding a shoulder tack on the face of the opponent.
In fact, overseas media and video are also exposed, and former English players are also struggling to say "not to be able to call Tacru".
[Video] "An insult and obscene play" and overseas ripples!
The real moment of the "face-face danger" played by the U.S. representative Kil.
The hot fight crossed the line.
It was 29 minutes after the arrival at 0-38.
It was a bit of a balance when the Lord Farrell caught the path of his allies.
I went to Tacru to this, but it was a crescent.
However, it caused the body not lower from the waist and violently shook the body.
As a result, the opponent's head and head contact and the shape that looks like.
Farrell was violently flying and fell.
A fierce protest was made by an English player to play a clear and untrue play.
The two players gathered together at once and became the air of the air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kil is a red card to leave.
But some of the spectators who were looking for a fair play were also asked for a bowl.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand's strong New Zealand is featured in the headlines of the Rugby W Cup 2019.
"Kil has made a modest shoulder charge on the face of the British Starr Farrell and has been dropped," he says.
In the article, we introduce the comments of Hugo Moña, a commentator in England.
"It's an insult, and it's not to call Tacru," he says.
The U.S., who had no match, managed to complete the game in the 81th minute.
However, the play of the curl left the evilness of the taste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the name of the hospital for the first time in 424 that it judged that there was a shortage of medical results, such as public hospitals and sun-red hospitals nationwide.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Public Health and Public Health has confirmed the results of the treatment of 14 public hospitals and has four facilities in Wakasa Takahama-cho, Oda Hospital in front of the three-dimensional hospital of the City of Tokyo.
⇒The four hospitals that are subject to restructuring are "comprehensive"
In order to reduce medical expenses that expands with aging, the hospital needs to be restructured and integrated with the hospital in the area of conflict.
In October, I asked for a full-scale study of restructuring and integration to give a conclusion by September next year.
There is no force, but the repulsion of the local chiefs and residents is expected from the anxiety that the hospital will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The hospital has a relatively small number of beds per 29 percent of the entire hospital.
By prefecture, Niigata (53-7 %), Hokkaido (48-6 percent), Miyagi (47 and 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46.7 %) and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of objects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on the data of the fiscal year 2017, the Ministry of Health and Welfare surveyed 1455 hospitals that support the "highly acute phase" for patients with severe difficulty, and "acute phase" for general surgery.
The hospital judged the need for the hospital's name release by analyzing the results of nine subjects such as cancer and emergency medical care, and analyzing whether the hospital is within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital will consider the removal and some medical departments to be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses surged in 25 years, when all of the mass generation is 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health has set the goal to reduce the number of hospital beds to 1,1191 thousand floor in 18 years.
At present, there are many beds of "highly acute age" and "acute period" where nurses are placed and medical expenses, but the elderly need for high rehabilitation.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but to increase rehabilitation.
In order to restructure and integrate the hospital, we formulated a "regional medical concept" that sets the number of beds necessary for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 regions and local governments and medical officials are discussing, but many of the local residents and the heads maintain a cautious stance and the debate is difficult.
By publishing the name of a hospital with a poor track record, the Ministry of Health wants to connect to the debate.

The recommended area of the pig cholera vaccine is the Ministry of Agriculture, Water (Fuji Shimbun Web) - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Corruption Guidelines that enable preventive vaccine to be tolerated to the currently uncognised pig, to prevent the infection of the "pork" infection.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which has been confirmed by pigs and wild boar.
It is limited to the area, such as the live pig and fertilized egg, but the distribution of meat and processed goods is acknowledged.
We aim to complete the process in October as soon as possible through public comments (representation of opinions).
By using the vaccine, it is possible to use a vaccine and to make use of the local distributions, such as meat, without being certified by international organizations.
Since September last year, Japan has been holding a temporary position in the Pure Land.
In the revised draft, the Ministry of Agriculture set up a recommended area of vaccine vaccination, based on the experts' opinions about the region with high risk of infection from wild bouncy to pigs.
The prefectural government has created a vaccine program that summarizes the range of vaccination, duration, number of heads, and how to proceed, allowing the governor to use it with the confirmation of the Ministry.
The other seven prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the area is revised, the situation will be decided very once again.
Movements such as insulated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses and excavating objects are limited to the region in principle.
For meat and processed goods, it is not intended to be based on the cost and impact of farmers on distribution restrictions, and it is practically unacceptable for distribution outside.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food garbage.
We also try to protect the safety of the infected pig and protect the damage.
The revised proposal of the Guidelines was summarized at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Corruption Headquarters.
In the future, we will hold a meeting of opinions and public comments to the prefectural government until October 7th.
A public approach to Honda Kei, and ManU!
"Please give us an offer and don't need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Saturday) 2:57 Delivery
As far as the last season, we left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and the former Japanese national representative, MF Honda Kei, who is currently in no position, made an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, in fact, was there a game?
The truth of heaven is revealed.
At 27 o'clock in Japan, Honda, who updated his Twitter at night, said, "Please give us an offer, but don't need money, but you need to play with a great team and a great team."
The other person who sent the "Reversal Offer" is Manchester United, the world's famous gate.
Why did Honda have a grand request for the prestigious club in the Premier League?
The opportunity is in the Australian version of FOX Sport released on 24th.
In the article entitled "The Five FWs" where Manchester United is likely to catch in the crisis of the injury, five players were picked up to be currently available.
Among the players such as Ham Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonnie, there were Honda's names.
At present, a number of injuries, including MFPaul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FWant Tony Marley, FW Marcus Rushford and others, have been in an emergency.
The "red devil" led by Ole Gunner Surshar is forced to slide down to 22 wins in the league and has a challenge to the quality of the front.
That's why Australia's media named it as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking is not a Striker, but as a creative side player, Honda's contract can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
9 points in the 18th match at Melbourne Victory are "hard record" but "33-year-old Honda needs to be fully attracted by his entertainment to manage Cambodian representatives."
What is the approach of Honda?
It is also noted that the United will move for the Tokyo Olympic Games next year, for the veteran who speaks to the goal.

"I hope that the sales environment is tough and we will be able to connect to new foreign customers."
Isn't it necessary to give up the first step?
Kadi's best shot today.
The 1W shot is not necessarily up and hit.
There is also a technique called "right-dryer" that you want to play the ball on the ground when you want to earn distance in the second round of par5.
The current 1W has a large head volume, and there are players who often practice this on the ground.
Ikemura's first victory is waiting for the tour.
In the 24th year of the professional year, he stood 166 cm tall and small, but he is now 7th in the dry Bingdi stance category.
On the other hand, one of the challenges was the fairwaywood accuracy.
I thought that I would try to do a straight draw, because I didn't shoot a spoon (3W).
From the practice round, you can put a ball on the lawn in the area and sprinkle oneW.
In cases where Big Carey is required, the two sides are making use of direct-drying at a narrow hall.
You can use a hall where the eye line is over.
The band recorded 270 yd and 280 yd with a calys.
"Because I don't have 3W, Caddy is more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cadillac.
The second longest club is the 17th UT.
It is also a great pleasure to hear the fight from the gallery.
Do you think that the club will move to the level?
"I don't fly straight on the top, but I'm going right on the cut track.It's originally a straight-dryer to perform the swing correction of the one-W shot at the time of the time of Tight-up.
Although the ball is not caught, it is accompanied by the risk of the slice, so the left side is canceled (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that makes me think of it...

Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to reduce the symptoms as much as possible and to "gete things".
dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle diseases, and tends to be easy people.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obese, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are regions that distribute food tickets such as food tickets, but food that can be saved is hamburger and pizza and chicken.
People who live in an environment where gas can not be used or electricity can not be used.
As a result, vegetables and protein are less food, and they are biased on lipids and glucose.
As a result, poverty, obese, and only watching TV, the body becomes free.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and work tend to be dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day.
