Driving in high heels is dangerous!
There are many mistakes that young people take on. FAQ How to open .
A violation of road traffic law.
The number of reports of accidents due to mis manipulation, such as the mistake of the pedal, has been noted, but it is a big mistake that only elderly drivers think about.
In the number of accidental accidents (the number of police station data in 2015), more people are more than 1080 people under the age of 24, and more than 1032 people over 75.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
Do you take a leg oshale?
Do you take safety?
There are no gender ratios and causes of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, young people are aware of other things such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, bread pups, sandals and mulls.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but many people are driving without worrying about the potential to lead to danger.
However, driving in the high heels and sandals is usually touched by road traffic laws.
One thing is to ensure that the handle, brake and other operations are performed. Article 70 "Process against safety driving obligations" defined as "We must not drive dangerously to those who cause accidents."
The other is the violation of Article 71 of the Compliance Committee of the Public Security Committee, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the provisions of each prefecture's public safety committee.For example, in accordance with Article 12 of the Act on Road Traffic Act in Miyazaki Prefecture, there is a statement that the driver will not be able to wear, slippers, or other things that may interfere with the operation of the High Heels or other operation.
Even in each prefecture, the same purpose is to be considered as a violation of driving in the "wear that may interfere with driving operations" until not specified as a high-heeil.
So why is driving in the high heels dangerous?
It's clear if you think about the basics of pedaling safely.
For safety-hard pedal operation, first fixed the foot or foot on the floor, then put the foot vertically on the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, it tilts right as a branch.
At this time, it is important to keep the car running regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in the high heels, there is a small area of grounding on the floor, and it is always gratifying and brewing, with a height of the heels to the foot, so the area of the foot on the pedal is also small, and it is not easy to adjust.
This could lead to danger.
In most cars there is a floor carpet, but this material is easy to pull with a high heels or a tight brake.
In addition, when the pedal is taken back, the heels are pulled behind the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The tournament will be held from May to May in Sdilman Cup (May/China), Indonesia's OP (July and results are 16 strong), JapanOP (July) and World Championship (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is probably a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, it was only one tournament of the World Championship, but fatigue is not greater than the war.
A good result is needed in the middle of the year.
Taiwan's Ace with a strong battle.
Young people in Thailand are also interested.
As well as Indonesia's OP and ThailandOP (S500) have won the tournament.
He also participated in the local Taipei POP (S300) in September and won the tournament.
Originally a figical player is strong and does not suffer from the battle.
Even though the tournament continues, there is no problem in performance of the game.
However, by gaining high points in the first half of the year, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament.
It was an impression that Shutensei had lost its explosive power until last year, but since this year, the stability of the play has increased, it has been able to continue its good performance.
For Momoda, the world ranking ranked first, it seems to be a bit more disappointed than ever.
He left the results in the first half of the game except for two players, but he left the results in the first half of the year.
It is the 3rd player of the Unders Anton Sen, who is struggling as a whole in Europe.
Cantabong has not reached the top tournament, but he has won the highest position in the 2nd tournament.
Although there is still a rough side, 20 years old (21 years old) who can be rallying against top players, etc., can be said to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic race.
In addition, Sisi Pranys B. has gone through a step in India where he has a good player.
Surmire rosema, Pranoy H.S., and the late with Kega, the Slicaris Kidambi, are also catching up in the future, so attention is needed for India after the mid-term battle.
New charges for mobile phones Discount in fair competition: Hokkaido Newspaper How Shinsei Electric Version
A new fee plan for the mobile phone company was introduced to the implementation of the revised telecommunications business law in October.
However, it generally stopped high.
In the summer of last year, Mr. Yoshihiro Kan said, "There is a room to lower about 40%," and despite the high expectations for lower prices, price competition did not occur.
It is a big factor that the full-fledged entry of the Rakuten will be forwarded and that the three major companies will continue to exist.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that can be used by fair competition.
I would like to call for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication fees.
Instead of selling terminals, communication fees were set to be higher.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced a plan to make the terminal up to half.
However, the two companies are using the "SIM lock" that cannot be used for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will make the terminal number up to 3 minutes for only the subscribers of its lines.
The three companies will continue to "wind" to prevent transfers to other companies.
Regarding SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated that it is obligated to withdraw immediately.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in heaven was not as planned for the maintenance of communication networks such as the base station.
It was hoped that it would be an explosion of a lower price competition.
There was a sweetness of the forecast.
The timing and fees of the service are not clear.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, we want to work with responsibility.
The price revision was made by Mr. Kan.
Mr. Kan noted that the competition will start in the future, and he was not thinking about it.
However, the lower official price does not seem to push the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should expand its customer base competition before the government is informed.
The fee structure of each company is very complicated and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called for attention, as the terminal has been advertising up to half of the amount of consumers.
We need to make a clear and easy explanation to understand that the company itself does not produce misunderstanding of users.

The second half of the meeting was 29 minutes.
The British captain's Farel took a somewhat balance when he caught his path.
I went to Tacru.
However, the upper body was not lower than the waist.
As a result, the head and head of the other person are in contact with the head.

On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the name of the hospital of 424 that it judged that there was no medical record among public hospitals, including 145 public hospitals and Japanese-red hospitals nationwide.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Labour and Welfare verifies the medical performance of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were included at the Oda Hospital in Taiyo-cho, Oda Hospital in Taiyo-cho, Oda Hospital in Taisetsu City.
4 Hospitals that are subject to reorganisation, "Stickness"
In order to reduce medical expenses that are ageing and expanding, we decided to take an exceptional response as it is necessary to promote restructuring and integration with hospitals in the area.
In October, we call for a full-fledged review of the reorganization and integration of the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
There is no forced force, but the reaction of local mayors and residents is expected to disappear.
It was released at the same time.
The target hospital was 29 per cent of the total, and the number of beds was relatively small.
Among prefectures, the ratio of Niigata (53,7%) to Hokkaido (48,6 percent) and Miyagi (47 and 5 percent) was higher in order for Okayama (43 and 3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on the data for fiscal 2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigates 1455 hospitals that respond to the "Advanced Acute Period" for severe patients based on public and public hospitals.
The hospital judged the need for the hospital's name announcement by analyzing the results of nine items such as cancer and emergency medical care, as well as whether the conflict hospital is within 20 minutes by car.
In the targeted hospital, you can consider abolishment and transfer some medical departments to other hospitals.
The medical expenses will surge in 25 years, when all of them are 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds to 1,191 thousand beds throughout the country.
Currently, there are many beds of "high-acute" and "acute" for medical care, while elderly people have less need for rehabilitation.
In response to ageing, the number of beds is simply reduced, but also needs to increase rehabilitation.
The Regional Medical Initiative, which stipulates the number of beds required by each prefecture for 25 years, is established for the reorganization and integration of the hospital.
It is divided into 339 areas, where municipalities and medical personnel are concerned, but many of the local residents and their heads remain cautious and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to promote the revitalization of the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with limited performance.

It is recommended that the pig cholera vaccine is recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Gifu Newspaper Web - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a plan to amend the anti-counterfeiting guidelines to prevent the infection of "Bang" cholera, which has not been recognized in the current situation.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed by pigs and wild boars.
Movements such as live pigs and fertilized eggs are limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is recognized.
After a public comment on the general public, such as a public comment, we aim to complete the process in October.
By using the vaccine and admitting the outer distribution of meat, etc., it is possible to eliminate the "clean country" certified by international organizations and to influence the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has maintained its position as a purifier.
Based on the opinions of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set the "Vaccination Recommended Region" based on the opinions of experts about areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a vaccine vaccination program that summarizes the scope of vaccination, duration, number of heads, and progress of vaccinations.
Other seven other prefectures, which are recommended for vaccination, are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the region has been revised, the situation will be determined very once again.
As a rule, the movement of infected pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses and wastes is limited to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not subject to the cost and impact of farmers on distribution restrictions, and virtually accept distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
We also call on the safety of the infected pig and work to prevent the damage.
The revision of the guidelines was made at an expert meeting on the same day.
In the future, the Government of Japan will hold a hearing and public comment to the prefecture until 7 October and implement a new warning guide.
It's an open approach to Noda Kei and Manu.
"Please do not need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo!
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 Delivery
As far as last season, we left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and the former Japan's representative, Mr. Kei Motoda, who is currently in no position, came to an astonishing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda actually came to the game.
The truth of heaven is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter Twitter at 27 o'clock in the late evening, said, "Please do not need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "Reverse Offer" was Manchester United, the world's name.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the best clubs in the Premier League?
The opportunity is in the article of the Australian version "FOX Sport" released on 24th.
In the article entitled "FW of five people who may have been caught in the crisis of the accident that Manchester United has been injured", five players who are currently available were picked up.
Some of the players, such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfried Bonnie, were named Honda.
In the United States, injuries such as MFPaul Pogba, DÃ¼ck show, DD Eric Bailey, FW Antony Markar, FW Marcus Rushford, etc. are now in an emergency.
The "red devil" led by Ole Ghunner Surshale, has been forced into a 2 wins and 22 losses in the league and has a challenge for the quality of the front line.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a new force candidate for Teco.
In the article, the agreement of Honda as a creative side player can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Perillara.
The score of 9 points for 18 matches in Melbourne Victory is "a steady record."The 33-year-old Honda has been pointed out that it is necessary to get full attention away from his entertainment to manage Cambodia's representative.
What is the approach of Honda?
It is also noted that the United will move for the next year's Tokyo Olympics because of the goal and the number of veterans.

For two years, the Commodity Council will purchase 500 units, acquire hospitality certification, and borrow cashless payments.
He said, "We want to connect to the development of new foreign customers while operating conditions are severe."
Ikemura's life is no longer enough for the first time.
Today's Kadi best shot
The 1W shot is not necessarily a hit.
There is also a technique called "Redodra" that you want to have a ball on the ground when you want to earn distance by 2nd per person.
The recent 1W has a large head volume, so there is a risk that the ball is scattered, but there are players who often practice it on the ground.
Ikemura's generosity is waiting for the first tour.
The age of 24 in the 7th year is 166 cm in height and small, and the 7th position in the driving force sector (average 304.02 yd).
While I was good at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
I thought I would like to try it again because I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W) in spring.
From the practice round to the tea area on the grass, you can cut the ball with a pot of potion.
In cases where Big Cary is required, it is often used to increase the number of ticks.
It can be used in the hall where the eye line is hit.
We recorded a record of 270 yd or 280 yd in the cavity.
I don't have 3W because I don't have 3W, so I can make it more secure than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, only 1W in the Caddy Bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees.
I am also surprised by the tour companions, and I am glad to hear from the gallery.
Do you think that the club behaves horizontally?
"Even if you hit the upper, you can't skip it straight."It's a cut path, right.It's the right to go right.It was originally done with a 1W shot swing correction at the time of the time of the time of the tie-up.
Although the ball is not caught, the risk of the slice is associated with the risk of the "left side can be undone."
It's a professional skill that I don't think about.

wedge shot in GarcÃ­a
I felt that it was possible to go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because it wasn't very good to get up.
Did you win the 6th Eagle, 7th Bardi?
Even after hitting the buggy at 4th place, there were also 5 people left, so if I had a feeling of returning, the chip-in Eagle was 6th.
Even though we were able to get a chance at 7th, we were sorry that we could not get up in the second half.
What did you get to this tournament?
It was good to have a solid key in the narrow course of the fairway because it was not so good for shooting.
Because the slope and the opposite side of the slope were different from the other side.
What is the difference between the regular tournament?
It was possible to shoot cameras such as smartphones.
I didn't really care about it, but there was a video or a video in the gallery.
I didn't have any other changes, but I just co-hosted a few Japanese players, so I decided to play the game with the feeling of "not losing to overseas players."
It will last for the second half of the game, but if you don't win more than one win, you should not try to win the prize king, so I would like to win another win.
How to prevent dementia?
We have included on our pages information about all the shootings.
A major pharmaceutical and university hospital challenges R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has been known that it could be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital I spoke to Prof. Toshisuke Otsuki.
There is no dementia.
How is the current situation?
Otsuki From mild to severe, the degree of difference may be dementia when everyone ages.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The well-used Donepezil drugs in Japan are already out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and there is no significant completion effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer as cancer death has declined due to infectious diseases and accidents, and cancer death has decreased due to the drastic progress of anticancer drugs.
The fact is that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to create a comfortable environment for society as a whole.
How to keep in the degree of "Unget"
Do you have people who are prone to dementia or are not?
Otsuki Even if it is unavoidable to become dementia, it is possible to reduce the symptoms as much as possible.
Dementation is considered as one of life habits and tends to tend to be easy people.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementation is considered as one of life habits.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol blood pressure.
The absence of economic power also affects.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets can be stored at a food ticket.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook.
When you eat less vegetables and protein, it will become a life that is biased by lipids and sugar.
Eventually, the body becomes unsatisfactory, but only when I see television, I feel free.
There are similar circumstances in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things are prone to dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read the book from the day to time.
