Driving in high heels is dangerous!
The error of a young man's pedal is multi-expected (Auto Mysse Web) - Yahoo!
In violation of road traffic laws.
The number of accident reports due to malfunction such as pedal mistakes has increased, but it is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
In the number of accident cases (2015 police station data), more than 1080 years old and younger, more than 1032 cases over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to young age groups as well.
Are you going to take your feet?
Do you take safety?
This data does not include the ratio of men and women, but is often considered to come from the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflex nerves.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the day's clothes, such as high heels, breadps, sandals and mulls.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who are driving without worrying about the potential to cause danger.
However, driving in high heels and sandals is usually touched by road traffic laws.
One is to ensure that the handle, brakes, and other operations must not be driven to harm the person who causes an accident, Article 70 "Slide of Safety Operation" stipulates.
In Article 71 of the Public Security Committee, which stipulates that the driver has to comply with the matters stipulated by the respective prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Road Traffic Act in Miyazaki Prefecture, "Do not run the vehicle (excluding light vehicles)" in Article 12.
Both prefectures and prefectures are not stated as high heels, but the purpose is to be considered a violation of "the footwear that may hinder driving operations."
Why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?
It is obvious if you think about the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe pedal operations, the foot or foot is fixed to the floor, and the feet are perpendicular to the brake pedal, so that when you step on the accelerator pedal, you can tilt the foot to the right.
At this time, it is important to keep the car stable, regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, since the area is small and the area is covered with the floor, it is always gray and brethren, and the height of the heels is angled to the entire foot, so the area of the foot on the pedal is small, so it is difficult to adjust fine.
This is considered a danger.
In most cars there is a floor carpet, but this material is easy to pull the high heels, and the heel pulls off the pedals when a sudden braking.
In addition, heel pulls the back of the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The reason why YouTuber became a regular employee.
I heard the president I adopted.
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is a popular place for young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use their products as advertising, but there are companies that have started the unusual mechanism of YouTuber adoption as a regular employee.
Direct marketing mix, which is the main business of the company's CRM (customer relationship management), is DmiX.
What does it mean to use YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director and Representative of the Company's subsidiary and staff First, who was actually employed by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who are working hard on YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is the adoption of YouTuber?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as "Kobayashi"): Now, the occupation of YouTuber has become a yearning for many young people.
The number of students who want to be in the future is also high, and the number of young people who want to continue to grow.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have dreamed of bandman and comedy performers.
In the same way, a young man who is chasing the dream of becoming a YouTuber is to support it.
There is an image of an individual who voluntarily posts a video, but why did you think about " recruitment"?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the job of YouTuber, most YouTuber is a reality that there is no profit as expected.
There are few creators who have a part-time job as well as creators who are making and posting videos, and who do not accept YouTuber.
In this project, we provide the environment for creators who have been hired to pay and create content.
At first, we would like to support our activities by supporting the disadvantages of the occupation of YouTuber.

From May, the tournament will be held at the Sdirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesian OP (July/September 16) and the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although there are few compared to other top players, it is likely that the burden of the body is reduced.
In August, it was only one tournament in the World Championship, but it was not much tired than in the series.
After September, the high-level tournament will be held in the middle of the medium-term battle.
Taiwan's Ace is a strong match.
Young people in Thailand are also noteworthy!
As well as Indonesia's OOP and ThailandOP (S500), Shutensei has already won seven tournaments.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September, and won the prize.
He was originally a very strong physical player, and won't struggle with the match.
Even after the tournament continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, by earning high points in the first half of the year, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament.
It was an impression that Shutensei had a lack of explosive power until last year, but this year, the stable sense of play began to increase.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, it seems to be more than ever.
In addition to the two players, the results were left in the first half of the year in the first half of the year.
He is a three-time player of the Unders Antonsen, who is struggling with the Europeans.
The Kantaphones are not open to the top-level tournament, but they have earned the top-level win, such as entering the best 4 in the second tournament this year.
There is still a rough side, but 20 years old (21 years old on 18th) that can be a rally with top players, etc., can be said to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
In addition, Cy Planetys B. took a step in India, where he was a good player for singles.
Surmi rosema and Prano H.S. are also lagged behind in Kenga, and the silicanics Kidambi will be chased up in the future, so it is necessary to pay attention to India since the midfield battle.
New rates for mobile phones We will reduce the value in fair competition: Hokkaido Newspapers How Shin-Electronic Edition
In October, a new rate plan for the mobile phone company was launched.
However, it was generally closed.
In the summer of last year, Mr. Yoshio Suga said, "There is room to lower about 40%," and despite the high expectations for lower prices, price competition has not occurred.
It is a major factor in the continued olivine state of three major companies.
For consumers, it is desirable to be an easy-to-use rate system due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on the terminal and communication charges.
Instead of being able to sell the terminal, the communication fee was set to be higher.
SoftBank and KDDI announced a plan to make the device up to half.
However, "SIM Lock" is a device that can not be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will make up one-third of the device's total number of subscribers.
The three companies will continue to "wind" to prevent transfers to other companies.
Regarding SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated that it is necessary to immediately terminate the SIM lock.
Companies need to respond quickly.
It is said that the maintenance of communication networks such as the base station was not as planned.
It was expected that it would become an explosive agent for low-value competition.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been clarified.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
The renewal of the price was triggered by Mr. Kan.
Mr. Suga said, "I think that the competition will start in the future, and I don't think about it."
However, it seems that the "reduction of government products" will make the market loose and promote sound competition.
The company should develop a customer base competition before being excused from the government.
The rate system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Agency called for attention, as the terminal has been advertising such as "the maximum of half."
We need to carefully and easily explain our company so that we can't misunderstand you.

[ Rugby W Cup] 1 withdrawal and struggle U.S. players' face-to-face dangerous tuckle (The ANSWER) - The ANSWER - Yahoo! News
The U.S.FL Quil is a rough play, a former British representative, called Tackl.
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan's Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was held on 26th, and the United States, which became the last in 20 countries, lost in 7-45 in England.
It became a black star, but the second half of the year, the Fl John Quill played a ripple.
In the face of the opponent's face, the shoulder tackle is put in place.
The actual scene was released with video, and the former English national team also said, "It is a shameless play".
[Video] "Impressive and substantiated play" and " overseas ripples!
In the real moment of the U.S. representative Quil played the role of the U.S. representative Kuil.
The hot struggle has crossed the line.
It was in the second half of the second half of the year.
In the midst of the enemy, the British commander Farrell fell into a balance when he caught his allies' paths.
I went to Tackl.
However, he raised his body, not from his waist, and put his body on his upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact, and the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
The English player obviously protested as a result of a lack of legitimacy.
The two military players gathered together and became the air.
As a result of TMO's video evaluation, Quill is placed in a red card to exit.
But some of the spectators wanted to play the fair.
The local media " Staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby player in New Zealand, is featured in the rugby W Cup 2019: the U.S. player is a poor play, and England is a win.
He said, "Kil is a poor shoulder charge on the face of the British Star Farrrell and has been dropped."
In the article, he introduced the comments of the former British player Wugo Mona.
He said, "It's an insult, and is not called tacre, it's a bad play."
The U.S., which was one of the biggest players in the game, managed to escape the loss of the U.S. in 81 minutes.
However, the play of Quil left the bad taste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare released a hospital name of 424, which was determined that there was little medical record among public hospitals and public hospitals, including 1455 public hospitals nationwide.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has verified the results of the treatment of 14 public hospitals and public hospitals. The four facilities of the State Hospital of the State Hospital of the State Hospital of the State Hospital of the State Hospital of the State Hospital of the City of straw hospitals in the city of Yai-shi.
⇒The four hospitals targeted for restructuring are "commodity"
In order to reduce the medical costs of aging and expansion, the hospital in the competing area needs to be reorganized and integrated.
In October, we requested a full-fledged review of the reorganization and integration of the target hospitals and decided to conclude by September next year.
There is no force, but the local chiefs and residents are expected to be repulsive due to anxiety that the hospital is gone.
It was released at the same time.
The target hospital was 29 percent of the total, and the number of beds was relatively small.
In each prefecture, the ratio was high in the order of Niigata (53 and 7 %), Hokkaido (48 and 6 %), Miyagi (47 and 5 %), Yamaguchi (46 and 7 %), and Okayama (43 and 3 %).
The number of the target was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one.
Based on data from fiscal 2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigates 1455 hospitals that respond to "accuracy acute phase" for patients with serious diseases, and "ac acute phase" for general surgery.
We analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, as well as if the competing hospital was within 20 minutes by car, and decided to publish the hospital name.
In the hospitals that are subject to the hospital, some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical costs have increased in the past 25 years, when all of the group's mass generation are 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set the goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 1,190,000 beds in 18 years.
At present, there are many beds for "high acute" and "ac acute" beds, which are expensive to accommodate nurses, but there is a lack of rehabilitation for elderly people.
In order to accommodate the aging population, it is necessary to reduce the number of beds, as well as increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that sets the number of beds required for 25 years.
Local governments and medical personnel are divided into 339 areas, and many of the local residents and chiefs have maintained their cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to promote discussions by releasing the name of a hospital that has little track record.

9 prefectures recommended for pig cholera vaccine - The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Gifu Shimbun - Yahoo!
On 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the anti-counterfeiting guidelines to prevent the spread of the "Bit" cholera infection, which is not currently recognized.
The target area is a policy to select nine prefectures, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild bovines are confirmed.
It is confined to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is recognized.
After a public comment to the general public, we aim to complete the process in October.
By using vaccines and recognizing local distribution, such as meat, it is possible that the country is not recognized by international organizations and can affect pork exports.
Since last September, Japan has been in a state where the status of the Pure Land has been temporarily suspended.
In the revised draft, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set "Vaccination Recommended Area" based on the opinion of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild bovine to pig.
The target prefecture will create a "Vaccine Immunization Program" that summarizes the scope, duration, head count, and direction of vaccination.
Seven other prefectures listed as recommended areas of vaccination include Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the guidelines were revised, the region was decided very seriously.
Movements such as inoccured pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, etc. are limited in principle to the region.
For meat and processed products, they do not target due to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact of the farmers.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He complained about the safety of the infected pigs, and also addressed the prevention of damage to the reputation.
The revision of the Guidelines was taken at a meeting of experts held on the same day, and confirmed at a meeting of the Headquarters for the Prevention and Prevention.
In the future, the Government of Japan will conduct a hearing and public comment to the prefecture until October 7 to implement a new anti-counterfeiting policy.

As far as last season, the Australian A League left Melbourne Victory, and the former Japan's former J. M.M. Hon. Keita, who is currently in Japan, left an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda actually came to the match.
The truth of heaven is revealed.
Honda, who updated his twitter at midnight on the 27th of the day of the day in Japan, said, "Please do not have any money, but you must play with a great team and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, the world's main gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the most powerful club in the Premier League?
The reason for this is that the Australian version "FOX Sport" was released on March 24.
In the article entitled "FWs, which could be grasped in the crisis that Manchester United has been injured" five players were currently eligible.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Roche, and Will Freddie Boney, Honda was named.
At present, U.S. has been injured such as MFPaul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Villy, FW Anthony Mart, and FW Marskas Rushford.
The "red devil" led by Ole Gunner Surcherre is forced to slip two wins and 22 wins in the league, and is challenged by the quality of the front line.
Therefore, the Australian state media named it as a new force candidate for Teko.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player is analyzed that Andreas Petrella can embed a hole.
A score of nine in 18 games at the Melbourne Victory is "hard record", but the 33-year-old Honda noted that it is necessary to draw full attention from his entertainment to manage Cambodia's representative.
Do you know the approach of Honda?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move for the Tokyo Olympics next year because of the objective and official experience.

The Chamber of Commerce has purchased 500 units and has been leased for two years to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payment.
The representatives of the Chamber said, "I hope that the business environment is severe, and will lead to the development of new foreign customers."
Now, Naoya Ikemura Hiroyo does not need to make the first attempt.
Candy's best shot today.
1W shot is not always up and hit.
There is also the so-called "redora" technique that you want to hold a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by 2nd stroke.
The current 1W has a large head volume, which is accompanied by the risk that the ball is scattered, but there are players who often practice this on the ground.
Ikemura is the first to win the tour.
At the age of 24 in the seventh year of the professional year, the weight is 166 cm and small, while the seventh in the driving direction division (average 304.02 yd).
While he was good at long shots, the fairwaywood accuracy was one of the challenges.
In the spring, I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I would like to do it directly."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the lawn in the Ti area, and it can be easily removed.
In cases where Big Carey is required, it is often used to improve, but both sides are used in narrow holes.
"You can use it in the hall where the eye line is covered."
The bullet road measuring instrument recorded 270 yd and 280 yd.
"That's why I don't have 3W, and Caddy can be more secure than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only one W in the Caddy bag.
The second longest club is Vulto 17 degrees.
I'm glad that the battle method was surprised by the tour fellows, and I was happy to hear from the gallery.
It is said that the club is moved to a level.
"Even if you hit the bottom blow, you can't skip it straight, but you're going to the right: you're going to the cut orbit (when you're up) you're going to do it straight to correct the 1W shot swing.
The ball is not caught and accompanied by the risk of slices, but the left side is removed (not bent left).
I'm talking to Kantan, but it's a professional skill.

wedge shot in Galicia
I was able to reach the first half of the year, so I thought I could go with that momentum, but I couldn't help but stretch it.
I saw him win the seventh bardie.
Even after I hit the buggy in the fourth place, there were five people, so if I was feeling that I returned, I had 6 chip in Eagle.
Even though Bardi was caught in the seventh place, it was regrettable that he couldn't stretch in the second half.
What happened at the tournament?
I didn't have a good shot recently, so it was good that the fairway was able to hold a tight course.
Raf was also a course that changed the distance between the front and the back, so I had little experience.
What is the difference between regular tournaments?
There was a possibility of camera shooting.
I didn't care about it at all, but there were a lot of gallery people who were filming it.
I didn't have any other changes, but it was a tournament where few Japanese players were co-organized, so I felt that I could not win overseas.
In the second half of the battle, if you don't win more than one win, you'll have to win the prize money king, so I'd like to win another.
What is the way to prevent people from becoming dementia and to keep them in the degree of "get"?
Interview, sentence, and Watanabe Yo.
The leading pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are facing R&D challenges and are frustrated with dementia drugs.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it is possible that it can be kept in extreme mildness and degree of forgottenness.
At Kinki University Hospital I spoke to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki.
There is no dementia.
The current situation is what is the current situation, though the prevention of dementia or the drug is expected.
Otsuki From mildness to severity, the difference is that anyone can become dementia when they age.
However, it is believed that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Drugs commonly used in Japan are already out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and can't expect outstanding completion effects.
On the other hand, people have been able to live longer, as cancer death has decreased due to severe progress in treating anticancer drugs.
Therefore, the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not possible to solve the problem by yourself and the family, and it is necessary to create a comfortable living environment throughout the society.
How to keep in the "get" degree.
Are there people who are susceptible to dementia?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and to be kept at the same time.
It is thought to be one of the lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, Metabos tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterolemia.
Whether or not economic power is affected.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but foods that can be used for food tickets are frozen Hamburger, pizza and chicken.
Gas and electricity are not used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook.
Then, vegetables and proteins are small, and the diet is divided into lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, the body becomes unabated, with only watching the TV in the face of poverty but obese.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
In addition, those who don't think about things and don't work are prone to dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is not metabolized, it is necessary to read books from day to day.
