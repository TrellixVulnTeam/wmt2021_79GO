Driving in the high heels is dangerous!
The mistake of stepping on the pedal of a young man (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
The act of violations that conflict with the road traffic law.
The number of reported accidents due to mishandling of the pedals, etc., has been attracting attention, but it is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
In the number of accidents that occur on the pedal basis (2015 National Police Agency data), there are more than 1080 cases in which the number of people aged 24 years old and younger is above 1032.
It is important to note that it is not a lot of elderly people, but it is also important to attract attention to young people as well.
Do you take the oshare of the foot?
Do you take safety?
There is no indication of gender or cause of this data, but the difference between elderly people who are often thought to be due to the weakness of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, may be a mistake due to music, conversation, etc. in the younger generation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing a high-heeel, panps, sandals, mussels, and so on, and they drive them as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger, and who are driving without fear.
However, driving in high heels and sandals is conflicting with the road traffic law.
The first is to ensure that the handle, brakes and other operations are operated reliably. Article 70 of the Act on Safety and Driving, which stipulates that "the driver must not be able to harm the person with an accident".
The other is that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public security committee, for example, in accordance with the provisions of the Act on Road Traffic in Miyazaki Prefecture, the vehicle (excluding light vehicles) will not be operated by the vehicle (except for light vehicles) by wearing goods that have been worn by the driver in a manner that prevents the operation of the vehicle.
Even in each prefecture, the aim is to be a violation of driving in the "paints that may interfere with driving operations" even until it is not specified as high heels.
So why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?
It is obvious if you consider the basics of the pedal operation safely.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, first fixed the foot or foot on the floor, and then placed the legs perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the foot will be tilted to the right as a point.
At this time, it is important to keep it firmly in place so that it does not matter whether or not the behavior of the car.
However, in the high heels, the area surrounding the floor is small, the area is always groomed, and because the height of the heel is angled to the whole foot, the area of the foot to be grounded on the pedal becomes smaller, and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
It is thought that this will lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have a floor carpet, but this material is easy to pull whether it is a high heels or not, and the pedals are pulled when the heel is a sudden brake, and the pedals cannot be stepped down or the high heels are removed to the beats pulled by the heels, and it can be removed from the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where heel pulls to the back side of the pedal when stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The application agent is one of the following: Daisuke Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishiten, Kita-ku, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), Dai-ichi Yoshida (Yoshida) and Telephone 6-665-6038.
The company was established in June 1895 (Meiji 28), and was established in April 1961 (Showa 36).
At the beginning of the project, we started our business as a local manufacturer of Awaji Island in Nishi-Awaji-cho, Sanbara-gun (present-day Minami-Awagi City) in the name of the Kinki Ceramics Company.
In October 1986, the company succeeded in the absorption merger of the Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and the business succession of the Kinki Industry Co., Ltd., and changed its name to its current business, and transferred its main office to its present location.
Since then, we have established sales bases in Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Oita, Miyazaki, etc. to become the current system, and we have been engaged in the construction of the tiles.However, due to changes in consumer needs, Western tiles such as flat plate tiles are now 70 %, ibushi tiles, etc., were produced at a rate of 30%.
We have built a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction trading companies, and roof construction companies.In the fiscal year ended December 2004, the company recorded sales of approximately 31.6 million yen.
It was well known as a top tile manufacturer of Awaji Island.
However, demand has been increasing due to the sluggishness in housing market since the Lehman shock, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Great East Japan Earthquake, the earthquake and other damage caused by the earthquake and other disasters.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in profits associated with the surge in fuel prices, it was forced to continue with excessive debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, resulting in a severe debt.
For this reason, although financial institutions were trying to rebuild their business by asking financial institutions to mitigate the conditions for repayment of their debts, there was no signs of recovery in business conditions and the financial situation was gradually increasing.
We came here and decided not to support the project and decided to continue our business.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

"Beautiful and ugly" is the top of the paper.
What is the image of the " snake" that overlaps the beauty girl of the work of the film? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between the mysterious beauty and the facial expressions of the shadow?
From the 1950s to the 1950s, many works were sent out to the world, known as the first person of the "Fear Manga" and the exhibition "Finally, Mi Girl Collection" was released in August 2019.
If you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beautiful" and "fool" of the work once again.
[Image] It is attractive because there is a "shadow"?
There are five beautiful girls of the works that were not shown in the picture.
In the preamble chapter of the "Miko Girl Collection", there was a sentence saying "The beauty of the women in the opposite direction of fear, uglyness, the shocking scenes of the story and the development of the story stand out." However, there may be a contrast between the beautiful face, the expression of the grievances, the expression of the grievances, etc...
There is a keyword called "ja snake" in many of the works that appear in the film. However, the snakes are regarded as "were creatures" by the viewer, or people who feel "beautiful" or receive it.
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others say that they are not good at it.
That way, depending on the sensibilities of the viewer, the "mi" and "ugly evil" may be the "ja snake" of the creature behind.
In addition, this creature has been revered as a living creature with high spiritual power since ancient times, and the house where the "white snake" lived is said to be good.
In 1965, there was a series of "Gobi Girl" and "Unfortunate Girl" in which the work was based on the theme of "jae" and "Mamako"!
It is the market that the woman who has a shadow is a woman who is supposed to become a woman.
Is it a good idea to say "Coolbusty" type if it's an excuse? ... I feel like it's in common with the beauty girls appearing in the picture work.
Among them, "Orochi", the main character of "Orochi", which was serialized in the "Shonen Shonen Sunde" since 1969, is a beauty girl character that can be said to be representative of the work, but it is reminiscent of a "jake" somewhere in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth.

Mr. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, posted a comment together with the photographs of Kazuhiko Iwata, Secretary of Defense, and deleted the Twitter screen.
Mr. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, has removed the comments of the twitter, which he wrote when he ate at a yaktoriya in Saga Prefecture by 27 days.
In February last year, Mr. Yamamoto entered the prefecture on the 26th, to explain the results of the accident in which the AH64D combat helicopters of the Ground Self-Defense Forces crashed.
On the same day, "I went to Saga Prefecture on a business trip!"
In addition to the photos of Mr. Kazuhiko Iwata, the Minister of Defense of Japan, who was elected in the same place as a meal, he posted comments such as "Is it delicious".
In the event of an accident, a woman who was in a house has been injured and two men have died.

[Etsuyama Wakamizu] The circle of "Children's Dining", which provides children with free or inexpensive meals, is spreading nationwide.
According to research conducted by NPOs and other NPOs, approximately 3700 sites are active throughout the country this year.
Compared to 2018, the number of units increased by one or six times, and the number of units increased by nine from last year in Fukui Prefecture.
Why is it a children's cafeteria now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, a social activist at the president of the NPO NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
With the aging population, the area becomes lonely, and the shopping street is also declining.
The place where people meet is gone.
Therefore, there was a need for an exchange base in the region where people and people were at the same time.
Even though it is a children's cafeteria, it is a place for multi-generation exchange that is also a place for elderly people.
Not only does it eliminate food, it also leads to childcare support and the development of the health of the elderly.
We cut down the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
The most important thing is that you don't want to make children coming from there."
There are a variety of places that offer meals every day from the first month of the month.
The scale is large, ranging from a few people to hundreds of people, the venue is also diverse from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people want to do is being created.
Such a lowness of the rug is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management expenses and staff.
There are times when you hear issues such as safe management systems, etc.
Although it is a part of the project, "The values change depending on the involvement of many people". "The connection with society becomes a safety net when it comes to disasters, etc."
It seems to be the light that I hope to be a closed society.

"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Aba Beer," which was used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drone of the US forces that crashed.
It is possible to produce cheaply, and it is about 1,000 km away from the sea.
It is also a strength that is difficult to get caught by radar in order to fly low skies." (Pressman Tetsu Yokota)
On September 14th, the largest oil company in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization "Fushi" in Yemen has released a statement of the crime.
"The reason behind the Hocists is that Iran, led by President Rouhani, will not be able to allow the Saudis to be able to make money in crude oil if their country is unable to export crude oil; if they continue to implement crude oil embargo against Iran, the aim is to know the international community if the pain is associated with it".
In response to the bombing, half of the total oil production in Saudi Arabia stopped, and crude oil prices recorded a surge of 15%.
In addition, there is a voice that the oil shock will come again.
"I want to avoid military intervention until at least the end of the next year's elections, since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of US troops from the Middle East, Iran will continue to bomb drones in hiding the Hocists, and the United States will not be able to endure any time, and the possibility that Trump will make a decision to attack Iran" (Kugahara).
The "component war" of the United States and Iran has reached an immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber, a super personality, became a regular employee.
I asked the president who was hiring (bizzPA!)
9/27 (Friday) 8:45am (Friday)
It's a very popular YouTuber with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to take advantage of the advertising of their own products by appointing them, there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "the use of YouTuber" to be employed as a regular employee.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (hereinafter "DmMix") is the main business of the company's CRM (customer-related management).
What does it mean to use YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMix, and the representative of the subsidiary and staff who were actually employed by YouTuber, spoke to him.
I would like to support young people who are working hard with YouTuber.
What is the mechanism of YouTuber hiring?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as "Kobayashi") : The occupation of YouTuber is now a longing for many young people.
Even in the vocational ranking where elementary school students want to be in the future, the number of young people who are aiming for the future will increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have been chasing dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, I would like to adopt young people who are chasing the dream of becoming a YouTuber, and I would like to support it.
Why don't you think you're going to use it? – There is an image that the individual is going to post videos on a voluntary basis, but why don't you think it's going to be employed?
Kobayashi: While many young people have longed for a profession called YouTuber, most YouTubers have a reality that they don't have a kind of profits they think.
There are not many creators who can not admit the existence of YouTuber to their families, such as creators who are making and posting videos while working part-time.
In this effort, we will provide the creators who have been employed with the environment for creating salaries and content.
At first, I believe that we will support the disadvantages of the profession called YouTuber, which will become an unstable position, and we will support the activities.

"I hope that South Korea will return to GSOMIA" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State (News by Nikkei) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Napper, Deputy Secretary-General of Japan, South Korea, and Japan, said on November 27 that "I hope that Korea will reconsider its decision and return to Japan" on November 23 in response to a single interview of the Nikkei newspaper at the Ambassador's Residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for the U.S. government to refer to the rethinking of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing information on missile launches, etc., signed by Japan, Korea, the United States and Korea.
In August, the Korean government announced that it would destroy the agreement between Japan and South Korea, and the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Nappa argues that without GSOMIA, it is not possible to respond effectively to the crisis.
"There's time to get lost," he urged the Korean people to return to Korea.
The joint flight training carried out in July in the Sea of Japan was "for the first time in history", indicating the threat recognition that "It is essential for the United States and Korea to share values such as democracy and human rights in the alliance."
In recent years, the deterioration of Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging the interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of mediation," he said, "It will play a positive role to be able to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

Crop would not hesitate about the best moment in 2019 "(CL) It would be a reverse in Barcelona.Many experts and I myself would not be betting on it even if it was one centimetre.With a team with Messi and Sorres, it would be like the death penalty.It would be like a small chance, and we could not believe it.If you look back, you can say that this game has been held by the CL.
Finally received a more personal question, "When I blessed the Bundesliga victory, I woke up on a bench, and I didn't even know where I was.This time I didn't have such a thing.I don't like to get drunk because I was a person suffering from a strong sense of self-management.I do not like to get drunk.

I want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the macOS Catalina of the new operating system will start delivery even during October.
The specific date is not disclosed, but it may be delivered on October 4th.
[Look at the full picture] The release date of macOS Catalina may be October 4th.
The image above is the one that has been posted on the Apple site of Denmark (now fixed).
There is certainly a character in the image: "From October 4th to October 4th (fraden 4. otober)".
According to the official website, the accuracy of the information is high.
By the way, the feature that you want to try personally at macOS Catalina is "Sidecar (side car)".
This is a function that deals with the iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and is a function that has been previously realized with a third-party application.
And since Sidecar is a genuine function of Apple, it is expected that it is better at the degree of perfection (or response) than it is.
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but the first thing I would like to experience this next-generation macOS.
Sacra shrimp in the growth process PT, such as Shizuoka City, took a depth of 290 meters | The Shizuoka Shimbun
This year, he succeeded in filming in the deep sea of Suruga Bay, and on 11th, he was born in Kagahara, Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka Prefecture.
The "Yui-Sakura shrimp project" of the marine industry cluster council by industry officials such as Shizuoka City has succeeded in capturing salmon shrimp, which was born in the spring of summer, at the bottom of the sea level of 290 meters deep in Suruga Bay.
The images of the growth process are precious, and the stakeholders want to connect to the ecology of salmon shrimp with many mysteries.

A total of 300 people were confirmed for 17 minutes.
During the day, the traditional knowledge that the salmon shrimp in the deep sea is "forming a flock to a certain degree" was reaffirmed.
The adult body is about 40 millimeters long, and the individual that was reflected is about 23mm long.
It was identified during the spawning season with data from different seasons of the fried salmon shrimp.
In-depth analysis, we will ask Fujitsu Software Technologies, which constitutes a team, and Shizuoka Industrial Technology College.

[In the first half of the Bad Olympics race] The world leader, Kenji Momoda, and Shutensei, who are well-intentioned!
Men's Singles (Bado × Spirit!)
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Swisss Basel) held in August, will participate in the opening of the China OP (Usuzhou/Super thousand), which will be held in early September.
Here, we will look forward to the men's singles for the Mid-Autumn Festival (September-December) while looking back at the first half of the race from May to August when the Olympic Games took place in Tokyo next year.
The badminton tournament, which began in May, digested four high-level competitions (over the Super500) where top players competed at the end of the world championship.
In the first half of the competition, the two players, Kenji Tokuta, who won the second prize in the fourth tournament, and Shutensei in Taiwan.
Momota won the tournament where the world championship and Shutensei are able to win a high point of the world ranking point directly related to the Indonesian OP (S1000) and the Olympic race.
In addition to that, the Japan OP (S750) is also under control.
The tournament, which has been held since May, was held at the Sdilman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/July) and the Japan OP (July) and the world championship (August) in four tournaments.
Compared to other top players, the number of times is small, but it is probably a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, it was only one tournament in the world championship, so it would not be much tired than during the war.
The high-level tournament since September is required to achieve favorable results in the mid-term battle.
A Ace of Taiwan is strong in the fight.
It is also attracting attention to young people in Thailand!
In the same way, Shutenka, who won the top tournament in Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already competed in seven tournaments.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the prize.
It was originally a player who had a strong figcal and did not suffer a series of battles.
Even if the tournament continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half of the year.
It was the impression that Shutensei was missing the explosive power until last year, but this year it was possible to maintain a good performance by increasing the sense of stability in the playing field.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, it seems to be a more disappointing opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, the result was achieved in the first half of the year, with the young Ace Cantaphones in Thailand and the Cy Platos B in India.
And the three players of the Unders Antonsen, who is fighting as a European leader.
Although Kantafone does not have the ability to enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he has been able to enter the best 4 in this season.
Although there is still a rough side, it seems that the 20-year-old (aged 21 years old on the 18th) who have been able to rally against top players, has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
In addition, Cylinis B. has taken a step in India, where he has a good player in singles.
Samile Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans and Kiddambi, who are late in Kega, will also be pushed up in the future, so it is necessary to pay attention to the situation in India since the middle war.
A new fee for the mobile phone The price reduction in the fair competition: Hokkaido Newspapers How Shin-Electric Edition
In October, a new fee plan for the mobile phone company was released to the end of the Telecommunications Business Act.
But in general, it became a high stop.
In the summer of last year, Mr. Yoshihide Suga said, "There is room to lower about 40 percent," and despite the high expectations for lowering prices, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that the full-fledged entry of Rakuten has been sent ahead and the remains of the three major companies.
It is desirable for consumers to become a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I would like to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The revised law prohibits a set discount for the terminal fee and the communication fee.
Instead of being able to sell the terminals, the communication fee was set to be higher.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced a plan to make the device up to half of the price.
However, both companies and the two companies are able to use the SIM lock, which can not be used for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will make up to one third of the terminal fee for only the contractor of the company line.
The three companies will continue to "wind" to prevent transfers to other companies.
With regard to SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated the policy to immediately cancel the SIM lock.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten was because the maintenance of communication networks such as the base station was not proceeding as planned.
It was expected that the price reduction competition would be a blaster, so it was a good fit to shoulder.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
At the beginning of the full-fledged service, the timing and fees of the service are not clear.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on the business with responsibility.
The revision of the fee was triggered by the comments of the Secretary-General Suga.
Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the three new charges: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I do not think it is good at all."
However, the "reduction of the government's price" does not seem to affect the market and encourage a healthy competition.
The company must develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out from the government.
The fee system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Authority called attention to the case where the burden of the consumer outweighs half of the amount, given that the terminal has been advertising such as "the maximum amount of half."
We must strive to explain in detail and easy to understand, so that the company itself does not produce misunderstandings of users.

Yokotsuryu-ryu and Riku Oku-juku | The Shizuoka Shimbun Atsuko Izu-san's parents passed away.

[ Rugby W Cup] A one-stop withdrawal and adversity fight U.S. players' "face-risk Tuckle" overseas wave crest "An insult and inferior play" ( THE ANSWER) - Yahoo! News
The U.S. Fluil plays rough, the former British representative, "It's not possible to call Tackl".
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan tournament was held on the 26th, and the United States, which was the last appearance in 20 countries, defeated in England at 7:45.
It was the start of the black star, but the raft play played by the late Fl John Kil called the ripple.
In the face of the other person, it is made to add a shoulder tack to the face of the other person.
The actual scene is also presented with video, and the former English player is "s insulting and inferior play" "It is not a thing that can be called tuckle".
[Video] "Austration and austration play" and "Japanese ripple"!
The real moment of the "face-sided danger tuckle" played by the U.S. Representative Kil.
The hot struggle has gone beyond the line.
It was in the second half of the 29 minutes that was greeted by 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy, the captain of England fell into a somewhat balanced balance when he caught the path of his allies.
I went to Tackl for this, but it was a question.
However, the body was raised not from the lower part of the waist, and the body was violently put in the upper half.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with the shape that looks like a head.
The Farel was violently blown away and fell.
It is clearly a fierce protest that the English player will try to drive the creil in a play that lacks legitimacy.
The two military players gathered together at once, and they became the air of the first touch.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), the Kil will be discharged from the Red Card.
After the pitch on the face that the bucket seems to be evil, there were some people who were looking for a fair play.
The local media " Staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby player in rugby, featured the headline "Harai W Cup 2019: The United States players dropped out of play and England was a good win."
"Kir made an inferior shoulder charge on the face of the England Starr Farel, and was discharged." "It was almost a battle by the two military players."
In the article, we introduced the comments of the former British commentator, Ugo Mogna.
He said, "It is insulting and obscene; it is not a thing that can be called tuckle; it is a bad play," he said.
The United States, which had been absent from the game, managed to complete the game with a try of intent in 81 minutes and escaped the defeat.
However, the play of the crack has left the badness of the later taste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare released the 424 hospital name for the first time, which was judged to be "the lack of medical records" among public hospitals such as 1455 public hospitals and red hospitals nationwide.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verifies the medical achievements of 14 public hospitals. The four facilities of the Wakasataka Hospital in the town of Oda Hospital in front of the city's three-day hospital, the State Hospital Organization of the State Hospital of Awara straw hospital in the city.
⇒ Four hospitals targeted for reorganization "The standard is wrong"
In order to reduce the medical expenses that are increasingly aging and expanding, we have decided to respond differently to the need to promote restructuring and integration with hospitals in the conflict area.
In October, I would like to request a full-fledged review of the reorganization and integration of the target hospital, and to give a conclusion by September next year.
It is expected that the resistance of the local chiefs and residents is expected, due to the uncertainty that hospitals are not in force.
It was released on the same day at the meeting.
The target hospital was 29 or 1% of the total, and there were many hospitals with relatively few beds.
In each prefecture, Niigata (53,7 %), Hokkaido (48,6 %), Miyagi (47, 5 %), Yamaguchi (46,7 %), and Okayama (43,3 %) were in the order of the prefecture.
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one in the world.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals that can be used as a "high-acute phase" for severe patients.
We analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, as well as the location where the competing hospital is within 20 minutes by car, and decided to publish the hospital name.
The target hospital will be able to consider the removal of the hospital and the transfer of some medical departments to other hospitals.
The amount of medical expenses is increasing rapidly in 25 years, when all of the group's mass generation is 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labour has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in hospitals, which have a capacity of 12.6 thousand beds (18 years).
Currently, there are a lot of beds for "high-acute acute phase" and "acute period" where nurses are increasingly placed and medical expenses are expensive.However, there is a lack of rehabilitation for the elderly.
In order to respond to the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but to increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.
In relation to the reorganization and integration of the hospital, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that sets the number of beds required for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 regions across the country, and local governments and medical officials are discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to contribute to the revitalization of the discussion by announcing the name of a hospital with poor performance.
General training for disaster prevention such as the premise of the eruption of Mt.Komake and the path of the disaster.
On September 27th, the comprehensive drill for disaster prevention was carried out in the forest, seven rice and Kabe town in the Toshima tube.
About 400 people attended the event, including 20 staff members and residents of the streets and three towns.
The Hokkaido Koketake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council was held for the first time since it formulated a plan to evacuate residents in August.
The wide-area training in which residents participate was the first in 18 years.
It is assumed that the Mt.Komagatake erupted at 8:45am and the mud flow reached the town of the foot of the mountain.
The evacuation level of the eruption was raised to 5 ( Evacuation) and the evacuation shelter was opened in the forests of the seven towns, and the residents moved by busses and road guards prepared by each town.

A total of 10 million people, mainly students who sympathized with the 16-year-old environmental activist Gregor Thunberg, took part in a demonstration on September 27 in Vancouver.
The state of climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from the Vancouver City Hall to the Canbby Bridge and to the downtown library.
In front of the city hall in the collective place, people with plastic cards began to gather for hours before the start, and at 13 o'clock at the start time, the number of people who fill the streets of the city hall blocks.
After that, the number of participants continued to increase and more than 100,000 people participated.
In the road along the way, the police also took control of the road and watched it for a few hours until all people finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York, the city has held a number of events to consider global warming from the last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, we held a school strike on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in this day's school said, "I want to protect the Earth even if I rest the important thing of school," and many adults who participated in the work rest responded that "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
The recommended area of the pig cholera vaccine is the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Newspaper Web) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a revision of the Anti-Defended Guidelines to prevent the spread of the infection of the "Bitage" cholera, which is not recognized by the present.
The target area plans to select nine prefectures, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
It is limited to the regions of the country, such as live pigs and fertilized eggs that have been vaccinated, but the distribution of meat and processed products is recognized.
As soon as possible, we aim to complete the process in October as soon as possible through public comments to the general public.
The use of vaccines and the use of meat, such as meat, will not be recognized as a "clean country" certified by international organizations, which could affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of last September, Japan has been in a state where the status of the clean country has been temporarily suspended.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set a "communization recommended area" based on the opinions of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a " vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and progress of vaccinations, and will be able to use it in the Governor's judgment after confirming the province.
The other seven prefectures that have been listed as a recommended regional plan for vaccination include Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
In the region, when the Guidelines have been amended, the situation will be determined very much.
As a rule, the movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, and excavating objects is limited to the region.
In terms of meat and processed products, the target is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on the farmers, but the distribution of meat and processed products is practically accepted.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
It also addresses the safety of the sucked pigs and the prevention of damage to the reputation.
The revisions to the Guidelines were compiled at the meeting of the experts on the same day, and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defended Headquarters.
In the future, the government will conduct public comments and opinions in the prefecture until October 7th, and implement the new guidelines for the prevention.
This is an open approach to the owner of the company.
"Don't need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
As far as last season, he left the Australian-A-League Melbourne Victory, and the former Japanese national representative, Mmotoda Kei, who is currently in Japan, left an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda actually went to the game.
The truth of the heavens is revealed.
Honda, who renewed his own Twitter at midnight on the 27th of Japan Time, said, "Please give the offer."I don't need money, but I need to play with great teams and great teammates", and I made a public approach to a club.
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world's most famous gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the most powerful club in the Premier League?
The opportunity is in the article of the Australian version of FOX Sport, which was released on 24th.
In the article entitled "The Five FWs, where the Manchester United could grab in the crisis of the successive injuries", five players who are currently eligible to earn were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfreed Bonnie, there was also the name of Honda.
At present, the United has been suffering from injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FWantney Margal, FW Marcus Rushford, and so on.
The "red demon" led by the director of Aure Gunner Suel Sharil is forced to slip two wins in the league, and is challenged by the quality of the front.
It was Honda that the media of Australia named it as a candidate for a new force to put the Teko.
In the article, "The contract of Honda as a creative side player, rather than a strictly speaking Striker, can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira", is analyzed.
The score for the 18 games in Melbourne Victory is "hard record", but the 33-year-old Honda has pointed out that it is necessary to get full attention from his entertainment to manage the representative of Cambodia.
I wonder if the approach of Honda is real.
It is also attracting attention to whether the United will move for the next year's Tokyo Olympics to be a promising veteran.

On the 26th, Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce announced that it has completed the installation of a total of 500 units at a store in Hamamatsu city, with the aim of providing free mobile translation equipment "Poquet".
It is worth noting that the deployment of this translation unit in the same region will be the first in the country, leading to an improvement in the capacity to respond to inbound (Japanese travelers).

The city's central district accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" has also begun to display loans to customers, and the smartphone has made it possible to see the location of the store for foreign languages.
It can be accessed from the site of the Lake Hamana tourism area.
The grant aid for the 74 languages was launched in April by nine organizations in the city to receive the declaration of "Japan's first outbound support city Hamamatsu".
For two years, the Business Council will purchase 500 units and rent them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the meeting said, "I would like to connect to the development of new foreign customers while the operating environment is severe."
Is it not necessary to give up the first stop?
Today's Kady's Best Shotshot
The one-W shot is not necessarily good-up and not hitting.
There is also the so-called "redora" technique that you want to make a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by the second stroke of the par5.
The recent 1W has a large head volume, which is accompanied by the risk of the ball scattered, but there are players who often practice this on the ground.
Ikemura Kansei, who is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in the seventh year of the pro, the height is 166 cm, while the weight is small, and the seventh position in the driving posture category (average 30 4.02 yd).
While I was good at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
At the beginning of the spring, there was no shot of a spoon (3W), so I thought I would try to do it directly."
There are times when the ball is dropped on the grass in the area from the practice round and the ball is sprinkled with a thorn.
In cases where big cary is required, it is often used to improve the quality, but both sides are effective in using direct-dora in small halls.
"It can be used in the hall where the eye line is thrown down."
In the ballistic measuring instrument, it records 270yd and 280 yd in a carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W. Candy can be more secure than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, only one W of the wood in the Caddy bag.
The second longest club is the 17th degree UT in Loft.
The battle method that can be surprised by the tour mates is also happy to hear the feeling of being leaked from the eye-catching gallery.
Is it possible to move the club to the level of the level?
"Even if you hit the top, don't fly straight, even if you hit it with a down blow, you go to the right with a cut track.I was originally doing a direct drag to make the swing correction of the 1W shot (at the time of tup), and the attack angle of the club will be moderate in this practice."
The ball is not caught, but accompanied by the risk of sliced, "So the left side can be canceled (without bending to the left)".
I say to Kantan, but it's a professional skill that makes me think.

A political critic said, "I have been mentally ill, and I am using it for my parents and international left," and the television station that I chose has apologized for.
In Japan, on the Internet, there are a lot of people who say "It is good to go to school" about Greta "It's better to go to school" and so on.
In such a situation, Greta wrote on his own Twitter on September 26, "Why do the big people spend hours laughing and threatening teens and children?"
"I'm going to think about lies and conspiracy theories as long as possible."
Greta says, "Look, also started."As I was concerned, the people who hate me are still active.My appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and the places I am different from people, and they start to think about the lies and conspiracy theory as long as possible."
And the big people continued that they seem to have a point of discussion because they don't want to face climate and environmental crises.
I can't understand why the big people use time to laugh and threaten teens and children, but honestly, I can't understand.
In that time you will be able to have another good.
I think, I feel that they are threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.

Wedge shot shot shot in Garcia
I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I couldn't stretch it out very well, so I regret it.
Did you see the win in the sixth Eagle, the seventh bar?
Even after I hit the boggy in the fourth place, there was still a par5, so if I did it with the feeling of returning it, I got a chip in the sixth place.
Even in the seventh place, Bardy was able to catch a chance, but I regret that I could not stretch it in the second half.
What did you get to the competition now?
I didn't have a good tone recently, so it was good to have a good idea even if the fairway was small.
The rough was also a course where the distance is changed, even if the slope is countered by roses, so I did not have much experience.
What is the difference between the regular tournament?
I think it is a place where I was able to shoot a camera (smartphones, etc.).
I didn't like it at all, but if I was a gallery, I was filming a video or something.
I didn't have much other places to change, but I just co-hosted a tournament with few Japanese players, so I went to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to overseas players".
We will continue to the second half of the race, but we don't want to win more than one win, so we want to win more than one win, and there is also the ZOZO Championship in the near future, so we will try our best to get the top qualification in the tournament.
What is the way to prevent dementia from becoming a "get forgotten"?
Interviews, text/Wanabe-san (Wakabe-san)
A major pharmaceutical company and a university hospital challenged R&D, and it is a drug of dementia that is frustrated.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has been understood that there is a possibility that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits can be kept at extreme mildness and forgetting.
Kinki University Hospital I talked to Prof. Toshisuke Otsuki, the center of the stroke.
There is no dementia, but it is not dementia.
What is the current situation? - The prevention of dementia or the treatment of drugs are waiting for, but what is the current situation?
Otsuki: There is a difference in the degree from mildness to severe, and if everyone gets older, it may become dementia.
However, it is believed that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug used in Japan is already out of insurance in some countries overseas, and it is not expected that the outstanding completion effect is effective.
On the other hand, people have been able to live longer, as the death of infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer death has also decreased due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
It is also true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by the person or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment that can live comfortably in the community as a whole.
How to keep up with the degree of "get forgotten"
Is there a person who is easy to become dementia?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and to keep it in the degree of "get forgetting things".
It is thought that dementia is one of the lifestyle-related diseases, and it tends to be a person who is easy to become.
First of all, the people of Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence and absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there is a region where the food ticket is distributed to the poor, but the food ticket can be used is a frozen hamburger, pizza and chicken that can be stored.
It is not possible to use gas and electricity, and people living in an environment where the food is not available in the first place.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased by lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, the body becomes indebted because it is poor, but it becomes obese.
It can be said that the situation is similar to that of Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things, and those who do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books from day to day.
