It is dangerous to drive in high heels.
Many of the youth's pedals are wrong (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News.
A violation of road traffic laws.
There are more reports of an accident due to malfunctioning, such as pedal mistakes, but it's a big mistake to think that it's just a problem with older drivers.
In the number of years, the number of pedal-step errors (the 2015 National Police Agency data) is 1080 in more than 1032 cases over the age of 75.
It's not a lot of elderly people, but it's important to attract attention to youth as well.
How do you take your feet?
How to get safety?
This data does not include a gender or cause, but unlike older people who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, the young age may be misguided by other factors, such as music or conversation, or by mistake or dress.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on high heels, breadps, sandals, mulls, and the dress of the day, and drive them.
Some people know that they are not suitable for driving, but some have no idea of the danger, and many of them are driving without fear.
However, driving in high heels and sandals usually affects road traffic.
One is to ensure that the steering wheel, brake, and other operations are operated, and the 70th article, which states that "the driver must not drive to harm the person with an accident."
Another is in Article 71 of the Public Safety Commission, where the driver is required to abide by the provisions specified by the Board of Public Safety, for example, in Section 12 of the Miyazaki Department Road Traffic Act, the driver wears a "slippers, slippers, sleighs, and other equipment that prevents driving, and does not drive the vehicle (excluding light cars).
It is similar to that in each prefecture, the intention is to consider driving in a "possible to prevent driving operations" until it is not specified as a high heels.
Why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?
It's clear to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe pedal operation, the foot or foot is fixed to the floor, and the feet are vertical to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, it is tilted to the right as a point.
At this point, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of the car's behavior.
However, in the high heels, the area of the pelvis is small enough to be grounded on the floor, and always glazal and breech, and because the height of the heel is angled on the foot, the area of the pedals is smaller and less solid, and the fine adjustment is difficult.
This is considered dangerous.
Most cars have floor carpets, but this material is more likely to pull with high heels, and when a heel pulls, the pedals are unable to pull, or the pedals are removed, the heel pulls the beats, and the heels are removed and the pedals are removed.
In addition, there are cases where a heel pulls the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

"Is it attractive to have a shadow?"
There are five girls in the film.
In the preface of the Beautiful Girl Collection, there was a statement that "the fear, the uglyness, the shocking scenes and developments of the story stand apart from the beauty of the women, but the contrast between the beautiful face distortion and the grudges ... may lead to more fear."
There is a word for "single" in many of the works, but the snakes are regarded as "unlike creatures" by the viewer, or as "beautiful" by people who feel like they are, or receive them.
There are some people who like reptiles in the world, but they are not good.
Thus, depending on the person's senses, "beau" and "ugly evil" may be a "shake" creature.

In his book The Snakes, there is a 1965 book entitled "Mama's Little!" and "The Girl" in the series.
It is worth noting that a woman with a shadow is a woman.
If I'm going to say it's "Coultivity" type ... it's like it's a common kind of beauty girl in the picture.
Among them, "Orochi" is a beauty girl character that has been serialized in the "Seven Boys Sunday" since 1969 and is a representative of the picture, but is a deep sleep every hundred years to preserve eternal life and eternal youth, and some of the things that have magical power.

It can be manufactured cheaply, with a range of about 1,000 km.
It's hard to be caught by radar to fly low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, the Saudi Arabian Ramko, was bombarded by ten military drones.
Shortly afterwards, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Hoosi, announced a statement.
"It's clear that behind the Hoosi, President Rohani's head, Iran will not allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil in oil if their country is unable to export crude oil, but if they continue to impose crude oil embargoes against Iran, they will know the international community if the pain is associated with it."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production ceased, and oil prices rose to 15%.
There are also calls for oil shocks to come back.
"It's not until at least the end of the next year's election, so I'm sure that Iran will continue to bomb the drones in hiding the Hoos, but the U.S."
The U.S. and Iran's "prosecutional war" are at an immediate risk.
The reason why YouTuber became a regular employee.
He asked the president to adopt it.
9/27:47.

It is not uncommon for companies to use their products to advertise their products, but some companies have begun to adopt YouTuber as their regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmiX), which is a major enterprise of corporate CRM (customer relations management).
What do you mean to use YouTuber?
He was the DmMiX CEO, and this time he heard a story by Yuki Kobayashi, who was actually a member of YouTuber's subsidiaries and staff First.
I would like to support young people who are working with YouTuber.
What is it?
Yuki Kobayashi: Today, YouTuber's profession is admired by many young people.
Elementary school students are also at the top of the future professional rankings, and the number of young people who will continue to grow.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have dreamed of bandman and comedians.
In the same way, YouTuber adopts a young man who pursues a dream of becoming YouTuber.
"Why did you want to "use"?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire YouTuber's profession, most YouTubers do not have enough revenue.
There are few creators who are making and posting videos while working as a part-time job, or who do not allow their family to be YouTuber.
In this effort, it provides the creators who are employed to pay and create content.
At first, we'd like to support our work by supporting the professional disadvantage of YouTuber, which would become an unstable position.

"I hope that Korea will return to GSOMIA" United States Secretary of State (Yay! News).
Napper U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Korea and Japan stated on 27 November that "I hope that Korea will rethink and return to the decision of the Koreans" for the Japan-South Korean Armed Forces Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which would expire on 23 November.
It is unusual for the U.S. High Commissioner to refer to GSOMIA's cancellation.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
South Korea announced in August that it would abolish the agreement with Japan, and if it failed, a framework to protect military information in Japan and South Korea would collapse.
Napper claims that "without GSOMIA, it cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
"It's time to lose," he urged the return of South Korea.
He expressed his threat that Sino-Russian Air Force co-ordinated flight training in July was "the first time in history" and claimed that "It is essential that the Koreans, who share values such as democracy and human rights, join the alliance."
The recent deterioration of Japan-South Korea relations has been described as "to harm the interests of the United States."
"There's no intention of an intermediary," he said, "We're going to play a positive role in the separation of Japan and Korea."

In August, it was only a World Championship tournament, so it was not much tired of the war.
From September onwards, a series of high-level events are required.
It is a popular Taiwanese ace.
The young people of Thailand are also interested.
At the top of Indonesia's OP and TiOP (S500), the race was already held in seven tournaments.
He also competed in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September.
It was originally a figical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the contest, there is no major problem in the game's performance.
Rather, by gaining high points in the first half of the race, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming contest.
It was an impression that the circulation had been lacking until last year, but this year, the increased stability of the play led to a steady performance.
For the world's largest peaches, it seems to be more or less disappointed than ever.
In addition to the two other players, the results were achieved in the first half of the season, but the Thai young Ace Kantaphon and India's Cyplaton B.
As a European, he is a three-player player of Anders Antonsen.
Cantaphones are not able to enter the final at the top of the tournament, but they have the ability to win the best four in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old 18-year-old) race with the top players has a great potential to leap into the race.
Cy Planetys B. also set out in India, where he was a favorite player.
Samile Barama, Pranoh H.S., and Srikaans Kidambi, who has been delayed by Köga, have to be careful with India since the midseason.
New charges for mobile phones are reduced by fair competition: Hokkaido Newspapers how Shin-Electic.
In October, a new price plan for a mobile phone company was introduced to the new Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it was largely stopped.
In the last summer of the year, Chief Justice Suga said, "There is room for a 40% reduction," and despite the high expectations for a lower price, there was no price competition.
The full-scale entry of Rakuten was sent forward, and the presence of three major groups was a major factor.
It is desirable for consumers to have a system of fees that are easy to use.
We'd like to ask for help from our mobile companies.
The Act prohibits a set discount on terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal, it was set to be expensive.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the terminal the largest and half-priced.
However, both companies have a "SIMlock" system that is not used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes the terminal one-third of the contractor of its line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfer to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has stated that the Department of Internal Affairs requires immediate release.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was because the base station and other communication networks were not built as planned.
It was expected to become an explosive for a low-value competition, so it was worn.
Is there anything wrong?
At the start of the full-time service, no fees are revealed.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, we will be responsible for business.
The change in charge led to the speech of the Secretary of War.
Mr. Suga complained about the three new charges: "I don't think we're going to start a competition."
However, the "decoration of the government" would not seem to encourage a healthy competition.
The company must develop a customer-oriented competition before being out of government.
Each company's fee system is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Authority called attention to advertisements such as the terminal "to be up to half" and that consumers had more than half their burden.
The company must be careful and easy-to-understand explanation to ensure that the user is not mistaken.
The sum of the money is reduced to 50 million yen.
The three credit banks in Mie Prefecture (the Kuwa name triple credit card, the northern Ise Ueno credit card, and the northern credit card) announced on June 26 that they had decided to reduce the cash card's amount to prevent damage.
It has a cash card in the Kuwa name Mie, Northern Ise Ueno, and Ki-North respectively, and for the past three years it is estimated that a cash card can be raised to a maximum of 500,000 yen per day for depositors aged 70 or older who do not have a fixed cash deposit.
On 1 October, the Kuwa name triple credit card and the northern Ise Ueno credit card were lowered from 1 November.
In the county, financial institutions and police officials have cleared the cash card and a number of special fraud cases issued by ATMs, and credit card officials have stated that they want to "protect your valuable deposit in the way they can."
They moved to the rear room, where they died from a sudden death of the Izum.
On 27 October, the Japanese Sumo Association announced that after the death of the parent of the Ikebo, they had approved the transfer of three parabolics, three parabolics, and one man to the back room.
The interior of the room is the same as the chamber.
The master's land relatives (originally the Great Guan Kirishima) are a brother of the deceased, who comes from a chamber.
He died suddenly on the 16th of the day, and the cranes were held in the same single-way mirror-yama room, where further treatment was discussed.
In the back room, ten gulls from Mongolia, the same as the crane, have 12 men in the fall.
Rugby World Cup: A Department and Warfare: The ANSWER - Yahoo! News.
The U.S. FLKIL played Laffle, and did not call the former English national team "Tackle".
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan tournament was finished in the 7-45 in England on the 26th.
It became a black-and-white star, but in the second half of the series, Laff Place, played by FLJohn Quill, called a ripple.
It is in the face of the opponent that the shoulder tackle is added.
Foreign media also released the actual scene in a video, and the former English player was "an insulting and obscene play" and "not to be called a tack".
"It's an insult and a bad play!"
In the event of a single withdrawal, the two men were outraged ... the real moment of the "face danger tackle" played by U.S. national Quill.
A hot fight was over the line.
It is 29 minutes after the 0-38.
On the enemy's side, the English captain, Farrell, had a little balance to catch his side's path.
He went to Tuckle, but he was Quill.
However, he raised his body rather than his waist, and he wore his body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact and they are in the shape of the head.
Farel was severely beaten and collapsed.
The Englishman apparently protested against the lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once and became air-conditioned.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill is released in a red card.
Bates left the pitch in a vicious face, but some of the spectators asked for a fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand media "staff" featured the slogan " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players are out of play and the English win".
"Kir made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English Starr Farel, and was released."
In the article, he introduced a comment from the former English commentator Woogo Mona.
"It's an insult, and it's a bad play."
In the United States, one game was lost in an attempt at 81 in an attempt to escape the game.
However, Quill's play left behind the taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced its 424 hospital name, which had determined that 1455 public hospitals and 1455 public hospitals in Japan had "no medical records".
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Labor examines the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, with four facilities: the city's national hospital organization, the State Hospital of the City of Tei-Zonghai Beach, located in front of the city's three-day hospital.
There are four hospitals that are subject to reorganisation.
In order to restrain the growing health care costs of aging, the hospital needs to reorganize and integrate into the competing area.
In October, he asked for a full-scale review of reorganisation and consolidation in the target hospital, and by September next year, he concluded.
There is no force, but local mayors and residents are expected to be repulsive due to concerns about the lack of familiar hospitals.
It was announced at the same time.
The total number of hospitals in the hospital was 29 or 1%, and the number of beds was relatively small.
In some prefectures, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43–30%).
The number was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
The Ministry of Labor surveyed 1455 hospitals, based on data from the 2017 fiscal year, capable of "altitude acute phase" for serious patients and "acute phase" for general operations.
He analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medicine, as well as the location of a rival hospital, within 20 minutes of a car, to determine the need for a hospital name.
Hospitals are subject to consideration, such as abolishing and moving some clinics to other hospitals.
Medical costs are rising in 25 years, when all of the groups are 75 years old.
As a result, the Ministry of Labor aims to reduce the number of hospital beds to 1,11916,000 beds in the country.
Currently, there are a large number of "altitude acute periods" and "acute periods" beds for nurses, while the elderly lack high rehabilitation.
In response to the aging of the population, it is not only necessary to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
As for the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture created a "local health care plan" that defined the number of beds needed for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 parts of the country, and is discussed by municipalities and medical officials, but many of the local residents and mayors maintain a cautious stance and debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Labor wants to revitalize the debate by publishing a poorly qualified hospital name.

A climate demonstration in Vancouver.
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall to Canbybridge and to the downtown library.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (JU) - Yahoo! News.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on 27 April that it would amend the precautionary guidelines to prevent the spread of the "Bread" cholera infection, which would prevent the infection from being recognized in the present.
The target area is to select nine counties, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed by pigs and wild boars.
The vaccination of living pigs and fertilized eggs are restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is permitted.
After a public comment to the general public, it is expected to complete the proceedings in October.
The use of vaccines and the granting of extra-local distributions, such as meat, may not be a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September, Japan has been in a temporary state of purity.
In a revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture set the "Vaccination Protested Area" based on experts' opinion about areas with high risk of infection from wild boins.
The prefectures of the target have created a "vacuum vaccination program" that combines the scope, duration, head count, and direction of vaccination, which is confirmed by the Ministry and allows use by the Governor.
The other seven counties that are listed as areas of vaccination are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the guidelines are amended, the situation is greatly changed.
Transfers such as inoculated pork, semen, fertilized eggs, bodies, and wastes are limited in principle.
The meat and processed goods are not subject to the costs and impact of the farmers, but are effectively permitted to circulate outside.
To prevent the spread of viruses, the food waste is processed.
He also sued for the safety of the inoculated pigs, and also tried to prevent the damage.
The amendment of the guidelines was met at a meeting of the Anti-Defamation Headquarters on the same day.
In the future, the government will conduct public comments on the prefecture until 7 October, and will implement a new anti-Defamation Guidelines.
An open approach to Manu!
"We don't need money" ( football channel) – Yahoo! News.
9/28 (Sat) 2:57.
As far as the last season, the Australian A-League football team left Melbourne Victory, and the current non-member Japan representative, MF-Honda Kei, took a surprising action.
What's actually going to play?
The truth of the heavens is revealed.
In the late night of 27 October, Honda renewed his Twitter account, saying, "We don't need money, but we have to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent a "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a worldwide nickname.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was released on 24 April in the Australian edition of Fox Sports.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs, which may have been caught by Manchester United in the crisis of the wounded, five non-members were picked up.
Among players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonnie, there was a Honda name.
At present, several people were injured in United, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FWantney March, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The "Red Devil" under the direction of Ole Gunner Soulshal, is forced to slip to 22 wins in the league and is challenged by the quality of the line.
It was here that the Australian state media named it as a new force candidate for Teko.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
Nine points for 18 matches at Melbourne Victory are "hard records", but "33-year-old Honda has to take full attention from his entertainment to manage Cambodia's national team."
What is the main approach?
It is also noted that the United will move for the next year's Tokyo Olympics because of its goals and veterans.
500 mobile translators were installed at the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores for free.
The PokeTalk, a portable translation that is free of charge for 500 stores in Hamamatsu.
On 26 October, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce announced that the company had completed a total of 500 units in the city of Hamamatsu, including a free loan to a portable translation machine, the PokeTalk.
It is noted that it is the first country in the country to have a translation focused on the same region, and that it will lead to increased support for Inbound.
There are 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134.
The city is divided by 60%.
The map app, Google Maps, began to display loans, and found a "foreign-language store" on the phone.
It is accessible from sites in Lake Hamana.
Poket's free loan to 74 languages began in April with the declaration of "One of Japan's largest inbound support city of Hamamatsu" by nine groups in the city.
The Chamber of Commerce purchased 500 units and leased it for two years to a small, medium-sized business site that met conditions such as the acquisition of hospitality and the introduction of cashless payments.
A spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce said, "I hope that the business environment will lead to the development of new foreign customers in the midst of severe business conditions."
Ikemura, who is now a direct draughter, does not need a tiup?
Kady's best shot today.
1W shot is not necessarily a hit.
There is also the so-called "director" technique that they want to play a ball on the ground when they want to earn a distance in the second half of the per5.
The current 1W has the risk of the ball scattering due to its large head volume, but it is also frequently practiced on the ground.
Ikemura is waiting for the first time.
The 24th-year-old professional is 166 cm tall and is now 7th (average 304.02 yd) in the Drybing Initiative category.
While good at Longshot, one of the tasks was Fairwaywood's accuracy.
In the early spring, "I'd like to try to get a spoon (3W) shot, so I'm going to do it."
From the practice round, she dropped the ball on the grass in the Ti area, and even cut it one by one.
In cases where Big Carey is required, it is often used by Tights, but the two sides are used by direct dragers in narrow holes.
"We're going to use it in a hole where we're going to hit."
The bullet-track instrument records 270 yd to 280 yd in the car.
"There's no more than 3 W, so I'm sure you're more than 3 W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1 W in the Caddy Bag.
The second longest club is the 17th UT.
I am also pleased to hear the news that the tour's fellows will be surprised.
"We're going to move the club to a level."
"We're going to go right on the right as a cut orbit, and we're going to do the right (at the time of the tie-up) 1 W-shot swing corrections, and in this practice, the attack angle (the angle of the club's injection) is also moderate."
The ball is not caught, but with the risk of a slice, the left side can be removed (not turn on the left).
I'm talking to Kantan...

Greta Toonbali: "Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?"
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City, Sweden's environmental activist, Greta Tonkberg, gave a speech on 23 September.
While his speech is drawing attention, Greta's voice is being insulted.
"Why don't people laugh and threaten children?"
Political commentators have said that Greta is "spirited" on American television shows, and that it is used by parents and international leftists, and the television station that used it has apologized.
In Japan, on the Internet, there are a number of sources that describe Greta's unspoken comments, such as "I'm sorry" about Greta.
Meanwhile, on September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why would the Grands laugh at teenagers and children and use time to threaten?"
"I'm going to think of a lie or conspiracy."
Greta said, "Look, and start, as I'm concerned, the people who hate me are still active, I'm looking, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm going to drive out different things, and they're going to think of what lies and conspiracy."
They later pointed out that the people do not want to face the climate or environmental crisis, but that they seem to be talking about it.
I cannot understand why the great people laugh and use time to threaten the teens and children.
It would be good at that time.
I think they are threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
