A violation of road traffic laws.
Although it is noted that there is a growing number of reports of mistreatment, such as pedal mistakes, it is a big mistake to think of only the older drivers.
According to the National Police Commission's report, more than 1080 people aged 24 and over 75 years have been reported.
It is important to note that it is not uncommon for young people to attend the same time.
How do you take your feet?
Are they safe?
This data does not include gender ratios or causes, but unlike older people who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills, reflexes, etc., it is also possible for young people to take care of other things, such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose to wear a variety of shoes, such as hiheils, breadps, sandals, and mussels, and the dress of the day.
While some people know that it's not suitable for driving, they're not going to be dangerous, and there's a lot of people who do not care about it.
However, driving in the Heiheil and Sandar is a violation of road traffic laws.
One is the "safety driving duty violation" of Article 70, which states that "there is no risk for driving a person who causes an accident to harm."
Another example is in Article 71 of the Public Safety Board, which states that the driver must comply with the provisions set by each prefecture's Public Safety Board, for example in Section 12 of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Act, which states that "the wearer, slippers, snippets, hajals, etc. shall be worn in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle."

Why is it dangerous to drive in Haiheil?
It is clear to consider the basis of a pedal operation.
For a safe pedal operation, the feet are fixed to the floor, perpendicular to the brake pedal, and the feet are tilted to the right as a branch point when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
In this case, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed regardless of the car's behavior.
However, in the Heahir, the area of the pedal is small, and the area of the foot on the floor is always gravy and breech, and the height of the heath, so that the area of the foot on the pedal is too small to be solid.
This may lead to danger.
Most cars have a floor carpet, but this material can be pulled by a high-hiel or a fast-braking, and the pedal is pulled by a heel, or the pedal is pulled by a fast-braking, and the heathle can be cut off by a heather.
In addition, when the pedal is pushed back to the pedal, the heels are pulled behind the pedal, and the Axel pedal is not returned.
