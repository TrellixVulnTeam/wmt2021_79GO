The operation at high heels is dangerous!
There are many cases of wrong-to-use accidents with young people (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!
A violation of road traffic law.
It's a big mistake to think it's only a problem for older drivers, although the number of reports of accidents due to malfunctions such as pedal stepping-in mistake.
The number of cases in which the number of accident cases (2015 National Police Agency Data) occurred after the age of 24 was 1080, resulting in more than 1032 cases over 75 years.
It's important to call attention to the younger generation.
Do you take the tail of your foot?
Do you take safety?
This data does not include gender ratios and causes, but unlike elderly people who are often considered to come from the decline of the body such as driving skills and reflection nerves, and other things such as music and conversation in the younger layer.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, breadps, sandals, mulls, and the day's clothes and driving them.
Some people know that they are not suitable for driving, but some people are not thinking about the possibility that they could lead to danger, and many who are driving without hesitation.
However, the operation at the high heels and Sandals is often touched by road traffic laws.
One of them is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brake and other operations, and Article 70 of the article "Do not be able to drive such as causing accidents to harm the person".
Furthermore, in Article 71 of Article 71 of the Article 71 of the General Security Committee, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the provisions set forth by each prefecture's Public Security Committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement of the Road Traffic Law of Miyazaki Prefecture, the vehicle is not operated by the vehicle in a way that prevents the operation of such vehicles.
Both the prefectures and the prefectures, until they are not specified as high heels, the purpose of the operation is to be considered as a violation of "the kind of footwear that may prevent driving operations".
So why is the operation at the high heels dangerous?
It is clear if you consider the basics of pedal operation safely.
For safety-secure pedal operation, the first leg is fixed on the floor, and the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilted to the right as the foot of the foot as a branch point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firm and not to be able to play.
However, in high heels, the area is small and the area of the floor is small, and it is always gratula and Bre, and the area of the foot to the pedal is small, and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This could lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull the high heels, and when such a rapid braking, the heels are pulled and the heels were pulled, and the heels could not be cut off.
In addition, there is a case that heels are pulled back to the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is gone.

"The beauty and the ugly" is a paper?
What is the image of the "sike" that overlaps with the beautiful girls of the work that are not embellished? - Yahoo!
Is it common to see the mysterious beauty and the shadow of the shadow?
From the 1950's, many works were sent to the world, and a collection of "Omi Girl Collection" was launched in August 2019, focusing on the beauty of the girls drawn by Mr. Umemitsu, who is known as the first person in the horror manga.
When I was looking at it, I realized the correlation between "mi" and "no fear" of the work I did not see it again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
There are 5 beautiful girls (five) of the works that are not in print.
In the section of the Beauty Collection, there was a statement that the beauty of these people in the face of fear and uglyness, the story's impactful scenes and deployments, but there may be a difference in the appearance of the face of the face, which has been distorted ...
There is a keyword of "shake" that appears in many works that are not in the eye, but the snakes are captured as "unlike creatures" by those who see it, and "beautiful" people are different from those who feel.
Some people who like the reptiles in the world are not good at all.
Thus, by the sensitivity of the person you see, the "mi" and the "bad" may be the "shake" of the inner side.
This creature has been revered as a more spiritual creature than ever before, and the house where the "white snake" has been living is good.
In 1965, there is a series of "Mamsako!" and "The Girl" of the series, which is based on the theme of the snake.
It is the market for girls who have a shadow, which is about to become a woman.
Is it a good thing to say to the "cool beauty" type if I am a must? ...It seems that it is in common with the girls that appear in the embellished work.
Among them, "Oki" which is the leading role of "Okiki" serialized in the "Daily Boys' Day" in 1969 is a representative of the work of the illustrious beauty girl characters, but to keep eternal life and eternal youth, it reminds me of a snake.

YouTuber is a very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to take advantage of their advertising in their own products, there is a rare mechanism called YouTuber adoption, which is adopted as positive employees in their own company.
Direct Marketing Mix (DmMiX) is the main business of the company's CRM business.
What does it mean to "take YouTuber"?
Mr. Masaki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX, was actually a member of YouTuber's subsidiary and staff first.
I want to support young people who want to work with YouTuber.
What is the " YouTuber adoption" in the first place?
Kobayashi Yuki (hereinafter, Kobayashi) : Now YouTuber has become a long-standing supporter of many young people.
It is also the top-notch employment ranking that elementary school students would like to take in the future.
In the past, we have adopted and supported young people who have been pursuing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
The same way, we are using young people who are looking for a dream of becoming a YouTuber and trying to support it is " YouTuber adoption".
Is it an image that the individual is making a video post independently of YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing to be a profession called YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers don't think they are profitable.
There are few creators who are making and posting videos while working on a part-time job, as well as those who do not recognize the existence of YouTuber in their families.
In this effort, we provide the environment for creators who have adopted their salary and content creation.
At first, we would like to support the activities by supporting YouTuber's professional depriority, which would become a unstable position.

【Bad Olympic Games in the first half of the race】World Champion Momota Kento, and strong Zhou Tensei lead!
Men's singles (Bad × Spe!).
In August, Japan won six medals at Badminton's Big Events, the 25th World Championship (Switzerland Basel) and participated in China's OP, which will be held from early September.
Here, the men's singles will look forward to the mid-term battle (September - December) while rejuvenating the first half of the Tokyo Olympic Games from May to August.
The Badminton Olympic race, which started in May, was digested by the top players at the end of the world championship (more than the Super 500).
In the first half of the game, the team won the fourth prize, Momoda Kento, and Taiwan's Zhou Tensei (Chengchen).
Momota won the World Championship, the Zhou Tensei, Indonesia OP (S1000) and the "World Ranking Points" that are connected to the Olympic Games.
Momota also has a JapanOP (S750) system in addition to that.
The tournament will be held in May in the Sdyllman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July / Results 16) and Japan OP (July) and the World Championship (August).
Although the number of other top players is less than the number, it is probably a schedule to keep the burden on the body.
August was the only one tournament in the world championship, but it would not be much fatigue than the two wars.
The top-level tournament since September is expected to be a good result in the mid-term battle.
Taiwan's Ace, which is strong in the battle.
It's attracting young people in Thailand!
Zhou Tensei, who also won the top prize in Indonesia's OP and ThailandOP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.
He also participated in the Taipei OP (S300) in September, and won the prize.
Originally, Fiscal is a very strong player and does not suffer the battle.
Even after the tournament continues, there is no big problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, by earning a high point in the first half, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament to be held in the future.
It was the impression that Zhou Tensei had a lack of explosive power until last year, but due to increased stability in the playing field this year, it was able to continue a strong reputation.
For Momota, the world's first largest number of people, it seems to be a more disappointed opponent than ever before.
In addition to this two players, the result was left in the first half of the game, with a Thai young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planneys B.
It is the three players of the Unders Antonensen, who are struggling with the same forces as the Europeans.
Cantaphones are not able to enter the top-level finals, but they are going to be the best 4 in the next season.
Although there is still a rough side, the top players and the other players were able to rally at the age of 20 (21 years on the day of the 18) would have a great chance to leap in the Olympic race.
In addition, Cypraneys B. took a step in India, which has a good player for singles.
It is necessary to note that Sri Lanka after the mid-range war will be driven by the slow-ends of Sammir Barama, Plano H.S., and Slicans Kidabi.
New Fees for Mobile: Low price at fair competition: Hokkaido Newspapers How does it look like electronic version?
The new rate plan for the mobile phone company was established due to the enforcement of the revised telecommunications business in October.
However, it was generally stopped by high.
In the summer of last year, Mr. Suga said, "There is a room to lower about 40%" and despite the high expectations of the price reduction, there was no price competition.
The full-scale entry of the paradise is forwarded, and there is a major factor in the continuing state of the 3 major companies.
It is desirable for consumers to become a cost system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I would like to call for efforts by mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communications fees.
Instead of selling the terminal, the communication fee was set to be higher.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to make the terminal up to half.
However, in the 100-day period between the two companies, the SIM lock, which cannot be used by other companies, is a mechanism for terminal use.
NTT DOCOMO is the largest number of terminals for only its own subscribers.
The three companies will continue to move to other companies to prevent the transfer to other companies.
Regarding SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications expressed its policy to ensure immediate release.
Companies must also respond promptly.
It was not until the completion of the communication network such as the base station was planned.
It was only expected to be a blaster for a lower-value competition, but it was a very fashionable shoulder.
Is there any sweetness of the outlook?
The full-scale service starts and charges are not revealed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work with responsibility.
The price revision was introduced by Mr. Suga, Secretary of State.
Mr. Suga said, "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's a good thing."
However, the government's price reduction seems to be a market and not to encourage a sound competition.
The corporate side should deploy the customer's main competition before the government is oral.
The rate system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The consumer agency called attention as a case where the consumer's burden is more than half the amount of money, as the terminals are "up to half".
The company must strive to make it easier to understand and make it easy to understand, not to make any misunderstanding of the user.

【 Rugby W Cup】One out-of-the-box & adversary The U.S. player's " face-to-face tough tacckle" is an international wave "terrorist and poor play" (The ANSWER) - Yahoo!
The U.S. Fairy is not able to call the former English representative "Tackle."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was held in England on March 26, and the United States, which was the last appearance of the 20 countries, was eliminated in England.
It was a black-star start, but in the second half, a rough-play played by John Cyle called a wave.
In the form of adding a shoulder taccle on the face of the opponent, one exit.
The actual scene was published in a video with a foreign media, and the former English team also expressed a bitter saying, "It's not like a tacl."
[Video] "Impressive and poor play" and Overseas Wave!
The U.S. representative Kyle played a " face-to-face tough tackle" in the real moment.
The hot comrades crossed the line.
It is the second half of the year that I was greeted by 0-38.
The enemy team was deep, and the English chief Farrell had a somewhat balanced balance when they caught the path of their allies.
I went to Takru, but it was a kil.
However, it was not from the waist to the bottom of the body, and the body was very intense.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are contacted, and the head is pointed.
Farrell was very flying and fell.
It is clearly a protest against the fact that the England player is trying to grab the kyle to play with a lack of legitimacy.
The two military players gathered at a time and became the first air of the air.
As a result of the TMO (video-determination), the kyle is a red card and a one-offer.
After the pitch on the face of the bats were bad, some of the spectators were asked to play the fair.
Rugby's strong Australian New Zealand's local media "staff" featured the headline " Rugby W Cup 2019: The U.S. players are going to go out with a short-term play, and England wins".
"Kil has made a low-cost shoulder charge on the face of the English star Faber, and has been discharged."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the former England team, Hugo Mogna, a commentator.
"It is an insult, and it is not called a tacple," he said.
The match was one in the United States, and the United States managed to escape the defeat of the ground in the 81 minutes.
But the kyle play left the taste bad.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced its first name of the 424 hospital, which determined that the number of public hospitals, including 1455 public hospitals and daily red.
In the prefecture of Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health and Welfare confirmed the results of the treatment of 14 public hospitals and 14 public hospital facilities, the National Hospital of Japan's Shoguni Hospital in Iwaki-shitakahama Hospital, Oda Hospital in front of Yotsune Town.
⇒Reorganization Targeted 4 Hospitals "Communications"
In order to reduce medical expenses in an aging and expansion, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate with hospital in the conflict area.
In October, I asked for a full-scale study of reorganization and integration of the hospital to conclude the conclusion by September next year.
There is no forced force, but it is expected that local governments and residents will be repulsive from the anxiety that the familiar hospital will become unavailable.
It was announced at the meeting of the same day.
There were a lot of hospitals with a relatively low number of beds per the total of 29 to 1%.
In prefectures, Niigata (53-70%), Hokkaido (48-60%), Miyagi (47-50%), Yamaguchi (46-70%) and Okayama (43 and 33%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, based on data from FY2017, investigates 1455 Hospitals that correspond to the "Advanced acute period" for severe patients, and the acute phase of general surgery.
The hospital's history of 9 categories such as cancer and emergency medical care and the hospital in which the competing hospital is within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital will be considered to be deprecated and some medical clinics to be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenditures are increasing in 25 years, when all of the Group's population are over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare set the goal of reducing the number of beds in 1246,000 beds (18 years).
Currently, there are a number of beds in the "Advanced acute period" and "acute phase" where nurses are placed in a hand and medical expenses.
In order to respond to aging, not only to simply reducing the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
Regarding the reorganization and integration of the hospital, each prefecture has established a "regional medical concept" that defines the number of beds necessary for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 areas throughout the country, and many local residents and heads of government are cautious, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to promote the activities of the hospital, which has a poor track record.

9/28 (Saturday) 2:57 delivery
As of the last season, the Australian A-league Melbourne Victory has left Australia's former representative MF Honda Keisuke, who is currently inactive.
[Video] Honda Keisuke Honda, in fact, was there a game?
The truth of the sky is revealed.
Honda, who updated his own Twitter at the midnight of the 27th of Japan, said, "Please give a chance to play with a great team and a great teammate," he said.
The opponent who sent the "Reverse Offer" was Manchester United, the world's leading name.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the most prestigious club in the Premier League?
The introduction is in the article "FOX Sports" published in Australia on 24th.
In the article entitled "FW of five people who are likely to be caught in the midst of an injury-related crisis," five players who are currently able to earn five.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Boney, there was also the name of Honda.
In the United States, injuries such as MF Pole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Byley, FW Antony Mal Char, FW Marcus Rushford, etc. are coming out, and the emergency is imminent.
The "red devil" led by Ole Gunner Sulcherle is forced to slip 2 wins 22 wins and 22 wins in the league, and has challenges in the quality of the front line.
So, the Australian media named it as a new candidate for the Tekota.
In the article, "In strictly speaking, the contract of Honda as a striker, not as a creative side player, can be buried hole in which Andreas Pereira is buried."
Nine goals in the 18 games at the Melbourne Victory are "a solid record" but the 33-year-old Honda says that he must take full attention from his entertainment that manages the representative of Cambodia.
What is the approach of Honda?
It is also noted that the United is moving because the Tokyo Olympic Games next year is a veteran who says the goal.

Today's Kady's best shot
The 1W shot is not always tilt-up.
There is also a skill called the so-called "director" that you want to make a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance in the second half of the person.
In recent years, 1W has a large head volume, which is associated with the risk of spreading the ball, but there are players that practice frequently on the ground.
The first victory of the tour is Tsuike Village.
The 24-year-old of the Pro7 is 166 cm in height, while the seventh-largest in the Dry Bingdance Division (average 30.4.0.2yd).
While I was good at long shots, there was a fairwaywood accuracy in one of the challenges.
"I didn't have a shot of a spoon (three W) before spring, so I thought I would try straight-dra."
The ball was dropped from the practice round to the top of the tea area.
In cases where the Big Carry is required, the Tirup is used extensively, but both sides are effectively utilizing the direct-dola in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
In the bullet-pass measuring device, the carimeter records 270d ~ 280yd.
"That's why I don't have 3W," Kady is also able to be more relieved than 3W.
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood in the caby bag is only 1W.
The second longest club is the loft 17-degree UT.
The battle law, which is surprised by the tour comrades, is also very nice to hear the feeling of leaking from the gallery.
Do you say, "I swing the club at a level (the horizontal).
"Even at the down blower, the upper is not straight, but it is the turn of the cutting orbit and the right.It was originally a direct drag to correct the swing correction of the 1W shot at the time of tilting."
Although the ball is not caught, it is accompanied by the risk of slices, "So the left side is erased (not bent to the left).
I'm talking to Cantan, but it's a professional skill that makes me think.

Greta said, "You've started again, "As you are aware, those who don't like me are still active in terms of my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm going to catch a different place," they began to post.
And the big people say that they don't want to face the climate or the crisis of the environment, but they seem to be talking about them.
Why do the big people use the time to laugh and threaten their children in the teens and their children?
It would be another good at that time.
I think they are threatening us.
But don't spend your time to pay attention to them more.
The world is starting to wake up.

Dodge shot in Galicia
Although I thought it was possible to reach the momentum in the second half, I was sorry because the Patter was not able to improve well.
Did you like to win the sixth Eagle, the seventh Bardy?
Even after I hit Bogie in fourth place, I had 5 per person, so when I was still left, I had the chip-in Eagle at No. 6.
Even in the seventh place, Bardy was able to get a chance, but it was regrettable that I didn't stretch in the second half.
What did you get in this tournament?
Because it was not good lately (shots), it was good that fairway was able to hold a solid key in a narrow course.
Rough was also a course that changed the distance between the eyes and the opposite side of the rose, so I had no experience.
What is the difference between the regular tournament?
I was able to shoot a camera (e.g., a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but there was a video of the gallery.
There were no other changes, but it was just a co-hosted tournament where there were fewer Japanese players, so I went to the game with the feeling of "not losing to foreign players".
In the second half of the race, I would like to win another prize because I don't want to win more than one prize, and I'm going to be able to get the top prize in that tournament as soon as possible.
What is the way to prevent dementia from becoming dementia?
Interviews, statements/san Watanabe (Associate)
A major pharmaceutical company and a university hospital challenge the research and development challenge, and dementia drugs that are failing.
However, it seems that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been clarified, and it is likely that it can be kept at a very mild rate and forgotten.
At the Kinki University Hospital, I heard from Prof. Toshisuke Otsuki, a brain graduate school.
No dementia is necessary.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki It is possible that there is a difference between mildemia and severe, and when everyone becomes dementia.
However, it is believed that a new dementia drug will take more than 20 years to be developed.
In some countries around the world, Dnepezil, which is often used in Japan, is already out of insurance adaptation, and there is no noticeable completion effect.
On the other hand, deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents decreased, while cancer deaths have decreased due to a severe advancement in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
They are not only able to resolve themselves and their families, and they need to prepare the environment for peace in the region as a whole.
How to Keep in mind?
Is there anyone who is easy to become dementia?
Otsuki Even if dementia is inevitable, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and keep it in the "getting" degree.
Diagnosis is considered as one of the lifestyle diseases, and it tends to be a person with ease.
First, metabos are prone to dementia.
dementia is perceived as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are regions that distribute food tickets to poor people, but food tickets can be stored in a frozen hamburger or pizza or chicken.
Gass can not be used for electricity, and people who live in an environment where food is not available.
Then it becomes a diet with a small amount of vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased against lipids and glucose.
After that, if you are poor, but obese, you can only see the TV, and the body becomes unfree.
The same situation could be Japan.
Other things that don't think about things, people who don't work are prone to dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things that are not metabos and reading books from around the day.
