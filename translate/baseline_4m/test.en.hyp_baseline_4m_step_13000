Driving in Heels is dangerous.
There are many mistakes in the pedals of young people. - Yahoo!
A violation of road traffic law
However, it's a big mistake to think it's just a problem with older drivers.
In recent years, the number of accident cases (2015 National Police Agency data) was more than 1080 in the age of 24 and over 1032 years old.
It's not always true for the elderly, but it's important to attract attention as well.
Take your feet the ossher?
Take safety?
This data is not included in men and women's ratios and causes, but unlike older people who are often thought to come out of the body, such as driving skills, reflection nerves, etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, pumpkins, sandals, mulles and on the day.
Some people know that they are not suitable for driving, but many people are driving without thinking about the possibility of becoming dangerous.
However, driving in high heels and sandals usually touches the road traffic law.
One of them is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations will be manipulated, and Article 70 "Prohibition of the safety driver's obligations to harm the person by accident."
Furthermore, in Article 71 of Article 7 of Article 71 of the "Responsibility of the Public Security Committee" stipulated that the driver must comply with the provisions of the prefectural government's ordinances, the driver shall not be able to drive the vehicle in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law.
Both the prefectures and the High Heels, as well as the purpose of violating the operation of the footwear, which could hinder operation.
So why is the driving in high heels dangerous?
It's obvious if you think about the basics on making pedal operations safely.
For safety-reliable pedal operation, first fixed foot or on the floor, put the feet perpendicular to the brake pedal and tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to ensure that the car's behavior is not to be fixed.
However, in high heels, the area around the floor is small and the area is always grueling, and the area of the foot around the pedals is also small and smooth.
This could lead to danger.
Most cars have a floor carpet, but this material can be easily pulled by a high heels, such as a sudden brake, and the heels could not be pulled off or the heels were pulled down.
In addition, there are cases where heels pull the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedals are gone.

There are few creators who are working on video production and posting while working on a part-time job.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for paid and content creation.

It is unusual for U.S. officials to mention the destruction of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is based on mutual agreement between Japan, Japan, the U.S. and South Korea, and sharing information on missile launches.
South Korea notified in August that the agreement between Japan and Japan will be destroyed, and a framework to protect military information in Korea will collapse.
Napper said, "No GSOMIA can effectively respond to the crisis."
"There's a time to lose," he strongly urged the return of South Korea.
"It's the first time for a joint flight training conducted in Japan in July," he said, "It is essential that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan shared values such as democracy, human rights, and other values in the alliance."
The deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging US national interest".
"There's no intention of mediation," he said, "It will play a positive role to ensure that Japan and Korea will be able to embed it.

Momota also has JapanOP (S750) in addition to that.
The tournament will be held in May and will be held in Indonesia, Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of other top players is less than the other top players, the schedule has probably reduced the burden on the body.
August was the only one tournament in the world championships, but the fatigue would not be bigger than the war.
A positive result is required in the mid-term competition since September.
Taiwan's ace strong against the war.
The young people in Thailand are also attracting attention.
He also won the top prize in Indonesia's OP and Thailand OP (S500) in the seventh tournament.
In September, he participated in Taipei OP (S300) in his hometown and won the prize.
Originally the figical is strong and the players do not suffer the war.
Even after the tournament continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Shuten was impressed by the lack of explosive power until last year, but in this year, the stability of the play was increased.

New rates for mobile phones: Hokkaido Newspapers How to Reduce Value in Competition
The new rate plan for mobile phone companies was launched in October due to the implementation of the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it was generally a high stop.
In the summer of last year, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kan said, "There is a room to lower about 40% of the price, but the price competition was not happening.
It is a major factor in the fact that the real entry of Leshan has been forwarded.
It is desirable for consumers to become an easy-to-use pricing system.
I want to seek efforts by mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal substitute, the communication fee was set to be high.
SoftBank and KDDI announced a plan to make the terminal up to half.
However, the company's 100-day operation of the "SIM Lock", which cannot be used by other companies.
NTT DoCoMo will make up a third-rate service for only the subscribers of the line.
The three companies will continue to move to other companies and continue to move around.
Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications gave a policy to terminate immediately.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the expansion of the communications network such as base stations.
Just as expected to be a trigger for a low-priced competition, it seems to be worn.
There was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start times and fees of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
The revision of this fee led to Mr. Kan.
Mr. Kan commented on the new price of three companies, "I think that the competition will start from now on."
However, the decline in government value does not seem to encourage a healthy competition.
The company must develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out of government.
The pricing system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.

However, the upper body caused the upper body rather than the lower back.
The result is contact with the head and head of the opponent.
Farrell was violently blown away and fell.

Both military and military players gathered together and became the air of the air.
As a result of TMO (video decision), Quill goes back to the red card.
After the pitch in a bad face, the crowd asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" of Rugby Australia in New Zealand is featured in the Rugby World Cup 2019: the U.S. player has dropped out of play, and England has a good win.

The hospital to be subject to consideration for deprecation and transfer of some clinics to other hospitals.
Medical costs have increased in 25 years, when the whole generation is 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in a hospital of 12.6 million beds in 2006.
Currently, while the number of beds in the "Advanced acute period" and "acute phase" of nursing care costs is high, the number of elderly people is short.
In order to cope with aging, you need to simply reduce the number of beds.
In order to reorganise and consolidate the hospital, each prefecture has established a regional medical concept with a number of beds necessary for 25 years.
Many local residents and seniors have kept their cautious stances in the area of 339.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote the debate by announcing a record-free hospital name.

A public approach to Honda Kei Yu, and ManU.
Don't need money. ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 Delivery
At the end of last year, the Australian A League, Melbourne Victory, and currently the Japan-Japan MF Honda Keizai, has taken a surprising action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, who was actually in the game.
The truth of Heaven is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on the day of the day of the day of the day of the day, said, "Please give a offer, but don't need money, you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the reverse offer was Manchester United, the world's name.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the most powerful club in the Premier League?
The initiative was published in the Australian edition of FOX Sports on 24th.
In the article entitled "FW of five people who could be caught in the midst of the injury-related crisis," five players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Boney, there was also Honda's name.
Currently, the United has suffered injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Anthony Malory, FW Marcus Rushford, and others.
The red demon, led by Orre Ginner Surshawl, was forced to beat 22 in the league and get out of a painful slip.
It was Honda that the Australian media named the new military candidate for Teko.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, the contract of Honda as a striper, not a creative side player, can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
The score of the 18th game in Melbourne Victory is "a solid record," but "The 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention from his entertainment to manage Cambodian representatives".
So, is Honda's approach true?
It is also noted that the United will move forward due to the veterans who are aiming to announce the Tokyo Olympics next year.

Candy's best shot today
1W shot is not necessarily a hit.
There's also a technique called "directed" when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second.
The recent 1W has a large head volume, and there are players who practice this often on the ground.
The first victory of the tour is Tsuike Village.
The 24th year of the professional 7th year was 166cm in height and small patterns, and the 7th position in the Driving Division (average 304.02 yd).
On the other hand, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
I didn't shoot a spoon (3W) before the spring, so I thought I would try to do it."
From the exercise round, the ball is pulled down on the lawn in the area, and the ball can be pulled out.
In cases where the Big Care is required, the two sides are used to make direct-dras in narrow holes.
You can use a hole in which the line is hit."
In the ballistic measuring instrument, it recorded 270yd to 280 yd.
"So I don't have 3W, so I can be more relieved than 3W."
Wood is only 1W from the Japan Tour Championship in June.
The second longest club is the loft 17th UT.
The battle method that can be surprised by the tour colleagues is also pleased to hear from the gallery.
Kotz said that he would swing the club to a level.
"You can't get straight down on the bottom, even if you hit the down broo, but it's going right on the cut track, and you're going straight to the right to correct the swing of the 1W shot at the time of Tick-up."
The ball is not caught and accompanied by a risk of slices, so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
Cantan says, but it's a professional skill that makes you think.

What is the way to prevent dementia and to keep things in mind?
Interviews, documents, and craftspeople.
A leading pharmaceutical company and university hospital challenged research and development and development.
However, we have found that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle can be elucidated and extremely mild.
Kinki University Hospital I heard about Professor Toshisuke Ohtsuki at the stroke center.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation - prevention of dementia or treatment?
Otsuki There is a difference in degree from mild to severe, which can lead to dementia.
However, it is believed that new dementia medications will take more than 20 years.
The medications used frequently in Japan have already been applied to insurance in some countries overseas and are not expected to be highly successful.
On the other hand, the death of infections and accidents decreases, and cancer deaths have also been declining due to increased trend in treating anticancer agents.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to create an environment to live in peace of mind.
How to 'get things'
Is there a person who is easy to become dementia and difficult to become?
Ohtsuki Even if it is unavoidable to become a dementia, it is possible to reduce symptoms as much as possible.
Dementation is considered as one of the lifestyle diseases, and people tend to be vulnerable.
First of all, metabolites tend to be dementia.
Dementation is recognized as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the U.S., there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets can be stored frozen hamburgers and pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where food cannot be used.
Then, the diet of vegetables and protein becomes a diet that is biased into lipids and sugar.
Eventually, the poor but obese, and the only thing to do is to see the TV.
A similar situation can also be seen in Japan.
Other than that, people who don't think about things and work tend to be dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to think about things reading books around the day.
