Driving in high heels is dangerous!
There are a number of accidents (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!
A violation of road traffic laws
Although the number of reports of accidents due to malfunctions such as pedal step errors is increasing, it is a big mistake to think that only an elderly driver is a problem.
In the number of cases in which the number of cases of pedal-step accident occurred (2015 police station data), more than 1080 cases under 24 years of age have been reported, and more than 1032 cases have been made.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
Do you take the tail of your feet?
Do you take safety?
The data does not include gender or cause, but the difference between the elderly and the elderly who are often considered to come from the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflex nerves.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, breads, sandals, mulls, and on the day.
While knowing that it is not suitable for driving, some people say it's troublesome to change their shoes, but many people do not think at all the possibilities that can lead to danger and are driving without worry.
However, the operation of high heels and sandals usually touches the road traffic laws.
One thing is to ensure the operation of the handle, brakes and other operations, "We must not drive to harm the person by accident" Article 70 "Safe driving obligations violations" set forth in Article 70.
The other thing is that the driver must comply with the provisions set by the prefectural government's Public Safety Committee.In Article 71 of the "Responsibility of the Public Safety Committee" stipulated by the driver, for example, in Article 12 of the Ordinance on the Enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, "ducked, slippers, high heels and other driving operations" (except the vehicle).
It is similar to the fact that both the prefectures and the prefectures are in violation of driving in the "wear that may interfere with driving operations".
So why is the driving at Healus dangerous?
It is obvious if you think about the basics of pedaling safely.
For a safe pedal operation, firstly fixed foot or foot on the floor, put the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At that time, it is important to keep firmly fixed, regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, the area where the heels are grounded on the floor is small, and the area of the foot to the pedal is also small and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull the high heels, and when the heels are pulled, the pedals can not be pulled or the heels are pulled, and the heels can be removed in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where heels are pulling behind the pedal and the accelerator pedals are gone.

The "beauty and ugly" is the paper's first weight.
The image of the "smoth" that overlaps the beautiful girl of the work of Ume no.
Is the expression of the mysterious beauty and shadow in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent out to the world, and the collection of "Matsu no Misako" (a collection of beauty girls) that introduces the beauty of the beautiful girls that Mr. Ume no Doo is known as the first person of the "Sound Manga" was released in August 2019.
When you take a look at it, you will notice the correlation between "mi" and "beautiful" of the works of Ume no.
[Image] It is attractive because there is a shadow.
The beautiful girls of the work of Ume-no-no-Mura are five.
In the chapter of the "Beauti Girl Collection" there was a sentence that "The horror, ugly, the shocking scenes of the story and the beauty of the girls in the opposite pole stand out, but the beautiful face changes to the expression of the resentment of the soul ... ...
There is a keyword called "peace" that appears in many works, but snakes are captured as "unlike creatures" by the viewer, or "beautiful" people feel "beautiful".
Some people like reptiles in the world, others say that they are not really good.
Thus, by the sensibility of the viewer, "mi" and "ugliness" may be the "jaw" of the creatures behind the table.
In addition, this creature has been revered as a living organism with high spiritual power since ancient times, and the house where "white snakes" live is good.
In the work of Umegami, which is based on the theme of the snake, there is a series of "Mama Soko!" in 1965 and "Matsuna Girl" and "A girl who is still."
In most cases, the market is a beautiful woman with a shadow.
Is it good to say that it is "cool beauty" type ...I feel like it is in common with the girls appearing in the work of Umegami.
Among them, "Okichi" which is the protagonist of "Matsuki" which has been serialized in "Jinju no Sun Day" since 1969, is the representative character of Umegami's work, but in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youthfulness, it is reminiscent of a snake somewhere.

It seems like the light of hope for a closed society.

Youtuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not unusual for companies to take advantage of the advertising of their own products, there are companies that have started a unique mechanism called "Youtube r adoption" that is adopted as a regular employee.
The company's direct marketing mix (hereinafter referred to as "DmMiX"), which is the main business of the company's CRM business.
What does it mean?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, the Representative Director of DmMiX, spoke to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is also the representative of the company's subsidiary and staff members who have actually been using YouTuber.
I want to support young people who are working hard with YouTube r.
What kind of mechanism do you think of "Youtuber adoption" in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi) : Now the profession of YouTuber has become a longing for many young people.
In the future, the number of young people aiming for the future is increasing.
In the past, we have adopted and supported young people who have been chasing dreams such as bandmen and laughter entertainers.
In the same way, it is "betr adoption" to adopt and support young people who are chasing the dream of becoming YouTube r.
Is there an image that an individual voluntarily submits a video?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTube r is not a revenue that is expected.
There are few creators who are making and posting videos while working part-time work, and creators who don't recognize the existence of YouTuber on their families.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for paid and content creation to the selected creators.
At first, I believe that we will support the activities by supporting the detriment of the profession called YouTuber, which is an unstable position.

"I hope that Korea will return to the GSOMIA" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State (Oma Shimbun) - Yahoo!
Napper U.S. Secretary-General of the United States (South Korea and Japan) said on November 23 that "I hope that Korea will rethink its decision to come back with a comprehensive security agreement (GSOMIA) of the Japanese and Korean military information that will be lost on November 23 in response to a single interview of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo."
It is unusual for the U.S. officials to refer to the rethinking of the GSOMIA.
The GSOMIA is based on the sharing of missile launch information, which is concluded by both Japan and the United States and Korea.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement between Japan and Japan, and if it is lost, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper said, "It is impossible to respond effectively to the crisis without the GSOMIA."
"It's time to get lost" and strongly urged the return of Korea.
The joint flight training conducted in July in the Sea of Japan also showed the threat recognition that "the first time in history" and "It is essential that the U.S.-Japan, which shares values such as democracy and human rights, will cooperate in the alliance."
The recent deterioration of Japan-Korea relations has pointed out that it will hurt US national interests.
While "there is no intention of intermediaries," he said, "It will play a positive role to be able to separate and bury."

This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and is a function that has been realized in a third-party application.
And Sidecar is a genuine function of Apple, so it is expected to be superior to the more completeness (or response).
There are rumors of the next Macbook Pro with 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next-generation macOS.

[Bad Games first half of the race] The world king, Tomoda Kenjiro, and the strong Shutennari lead a step forward!
Men's singles.
The Japanese national team who won six medals at Badminton's Big Event held in August, the 25th World Championships (Switzerland Basel) won the first place in September, and will participate in China's OP (Super 1000) opening from the 17th.
Here, we look back at the first half of the month from May to August, when the Tokyo Olympics began to take part in the next year.
The Badminton Olympic race began in May, and at the end of the world championship, the top players played in the first round (more than Super500).
The first half of the competition was played by Kento Momoda, who won the 2nd prize during the 4th tournament, and two of Taiwan's Shuten (Chose Tenchen).
Momoda won the championship with the world championships, Shunsei, Indonesia's OP (S1000) and the "World Ranking Point" that is directly connected to the Olympic Games.
Momoda also has a Japan-OP (S750) system.
The competitions that have been held since May will be held at the Sudir Man Cup (May / China), Indonesia OP (July / Results 16 Strong), Japan OP (July) and the 4th edition of the World Championships (August).
Although the number of other top players is small, the schedule is likely to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, it was only one of the world championships, so fatigue would not be greater than the combined war.
It is necessary to make positive results in the mid-field battle in which the top competitions will continue from September.
Taiwan Aces that are strong against the fight.
It is also noteworthy for young Thai students.
He has also won the prize at the top of the Indonesian Open and the Thai Open (S500) competition, and has already won seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei Open (S300) and won the prize.
Originally, the physical is strong, and the players who have not suffered the battle.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning a high point in the first half, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming competition.
At the end of last year, Shunsei had an impression of lack of explosive power, but this year, the stability of the play area increased, making it possible to continue a solid performance.
For Momoda, one of the world's top rankings, it seems to be a more disappointing opponent than ever before.
The results of the first half of the first half of the two players were left in Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and Cy Planys B. in India.
And it is the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who is struggling with the Nazis as the Europeans.
At the top of the competition, Kantafon is not able to enter the final race, but he has the power to win the top, including entering the best 4 in this season.
There is still a rough side, but the 20s (21 years of age) that have been able to rally against top players, etc. (21 years old on 18th) have a great potential to make a leap in the Olympics.
In addition, Cy Planys B. has taken a step in India, where players like the singles.
Samarama, Pra Neu H.S., and Sulican Kidavi, who has been late in Kega, will be chased up in the future, so attention is needed for India after the midfield.
New rates on mobile : Hokkaido Shimbun
The new price plan for the mobile phone company following the enactment of the revised telecommunications business in October was launched.
However, it was generally stopped.
In the summer of last year, Mr. Yoshiyoshi Kan said, "There is room to lower about 40%" and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor in the fact that the full entry of Rakuten is coming ahead, and the three giants remain in the oligo.
For consumers, it is desirable to be an easy-to-use pricing system due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits set discounts of terminal and communication fees.
Instead of selling the terminal bill, it was the setting where the communication fee would be reduced.
SoftBank and KDDI have announced a plan to make the terminal up to half.
However, both of the two companies have a mechanism for the use of SIMlock, which is not available for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes a maximum number of terminal units for only one of its own line subscribers.
The three companies will continue the enclosure to prevent the transfer to other companies.
In terms of SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has stated that it is responsible for immediate termination.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was not due to the improvement of communication networks such as the base station.
As it was expected to become an anti-bomber of the price reduction competition, it was very fashionable.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The start times and prices of full-scale services are not revealed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want to engage in business with responsibility.
The revision of the fee was made by Mr. Suga.
Mr. Kan said, "I think that the competition will start in the future, and I don't think that it is good."
However, the government's price reduction does not seem to slow the market and encourage healthy competition.
Before the company is put out of the government, it is necessary to develop customer-oriented competition.
The company's pricing system is very complex and not easy to compare.
The consumer agency called attention as there is a case where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount of money in advertising such as "up to half of the amount".
Companies themselves need to carefully and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstanding of users.

[ Rugby W Cup] one out of place and struggle against the U.S. players' face-to-face risk tackles overseas ripples "a insult and inferior play" (The ANSWER) - Yahoo!
The U.S.-Fluxe is not called "Tacle" by the former England representative.
The Rugby World Cup (Won Cup) Japan Competition was held on 26th, and the last appearance of the 20 countries in which the United States was defeated at 7:45 in England.
The black star started, but later, the Raf play played by the FL John Quill calls the ripple.
In the form of adding a shoulder tuckle on the face of the opponent, one is left.
The real scene is also published with videos from overseas media, and the former English player has also suffered from "a insult and bad play."
[Video] "It's an insult and a bad play" and a wavemon overseas!
In the event of an outage, the two military players are in turmoil...The real moment of the "face risk taclu" played by the US representative Kuil.
The hot spirit crossed the line.
The second half of the meeting was held at 0-38.
The enemies deeply and the Phare of the Lord of England fell somewhat in balance when catching the path of the allies.
I went to Tacl for this, but it was nice.
However, the body was raised from the bottom of the waist.
As a result, the head and the head of the other person are in contact with the head.
Farrell was violently blown and fell.
Clearly a lack of legitimacy, the English player is scolded as a candle.
The two military players gathered at a time, and the air was immediately exposed.
As a result of TMO's video judgment, the quell is left out with a red card.
After the pitch with a bad face, some of the spectators were asked to play the fair.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, Australia, is featured in the "Road W Cup 2019: the U.S. players are left out of play, and the headline that England is a pleasure."
He said, "Ki was a bad shoulder charge on the face of the English Star player Farrell and it became a retreat."
In the article, the former English player introduces the comments of the Comentheter's Wugo Mona.
He said, "It is an insult and not so bad."It is not a tough play."
The U.S., one of the essentials of the game, managed to get rid of the defeat at the 81th place.
But the play of the quell leaves the bitterness of the lateral taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced the first of the 424 hospitals to be named "the lack of medical performance" among public hospitals such as the 1455 public hospitals and the JRCS.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare verified the results of the treatment of the 14 public hospitals, and four facilities of the Wakasahama Hospital in the town of Oda Hospital in Yotsumae-cho, Oda Hospital, Yotsumae-cho, were included.
⇒Restruction of the four hospitals in the field of reshaping is wrong.
In order to curb the expansion of medical expenses in the ageing population, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate with the hospital in the competing area.
In October, we asked for a full-scale study of restructuring and integration in the targeted hospital, and we hope to conclude by September next year.
There is no force, but there is an anxiety that the hospital will not be in close contact with local chiefs and residents.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The hospital had a total of 29.1% of the total, with a relatively low number of beds.
In the prefecture, Niigata (53/7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent) and Miyagi (47, 5 percent) and Yamaguchi (46.7%) (46.7 percent) and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Labor, based on the data of FY2017, investigates the "altitude of acute" for patients with severe disabilities, and 1455 hospitals that can respond to the "acquired period" of general surgery.
The nine medical achievements, such as cancer and emergency medical care, were analyzed to determine the need to announce the hospital's name by analyzing whether the competing hospital would be located within 20 minutes by car.
In the targeted hospital, you will be asked to consider the abolition and the transfer of some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses will increase in the 25 years that all the Group's mass generation will be over 75 years.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in a hospital in 1246,000 (18 years).
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses, while the elderly are scarce.
In order to respond to the aging population, the number of beds is not only reduced, but also needs to be increased for rehabilitation.
Regarding the reorganization and integration of the hospital, we have formulated the Regional Medical Concept, which sets the number of beds required by each prefecture for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 parts of the country, and the local governments and medical personnel are discussing it, but the majority of the local residents and the chiefs have maintained their cautious stance and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by disclosing the name of a hospital that is not proven.

9 prefectures in the recommended area of the Pork Corra vaccine - Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Agriculture - Yahoo!
On 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a revision of the Anti-Corruption Guidelines to enable preventive vaccine to the currently unaccepted pig, to prevent the spread of the "Bang" cholera infection.
The target area is to choose nine prefectures, such as Gifu and Aichi, which have been confirmed by the infection of pigs and wild bouncy.
While the movement of living pigs and fertilized eggs in the vaccine is limited in the region, the distribution of sperm and processed products is recognized.
After public comments on the general public (a public opinion invitation) and so on, we aim to complete the procedures in October.
By using the vaccine and acknowledging local distribution such as meat, it is possible that it will no longer be a "clean country" certified by international organizations and will affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has temporarily held its position as a clean country.
In the revised draft, the Ministry of Agriculture set up a "communication recommended area" based on the opinions of experts on the areas where wild bouncy risks to pigs.
The target prefectures have created a "Vaccident vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and ways to proceed.
The seven other prefectures that have been listed as a recommended regional plan are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga.
When the regional guidelines have been revised, the situation will be determined very much.
Moving pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and pests, as a rule, limits the region.
The meat and processed products are not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact of farmers, and are virtually allowed to circulate outside.
To prevent the spread of the virus, we will thoroughly process food waste.
In response to the safety of the disabled pig, the company also tackles the prevention of the rumors.
The revised draft of the Guidelines was compiled at an open expert meeting on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Security Division.
In the future, we will carry out opinions and public comments to the prefecture until October 7 and implement new anti-psychotic guidelines.
A public approach to Manu, Keisuke Honda, who is in no affiliation!
Don't have money to do with the offer" Football Channel - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
In the last season, the Australian A League's Melbourne Victory left, and now the former representative of Japan, Mr. Keisuke MF Honda, has taken an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda actually played the game.
The truth of Heaven is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on the 27th of the day of the day of the day, said, "Please do not need money, but you need to play with a great team and a great teammates," he said.
The one who sent the reverse offer was Manchester United, the world's famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
The reason is that it is in the Australian version "FOX Sport" published on 24th.
In an article entitled "FW of five people" that Manchester United could seize in the midst of the subsequent crisis, five players were picked up by the currently unattended players.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, Will Fred Boney, there was the name of Honda.
At present, the United has been injured by MF Paul Pogba and DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcal and FW Marcus Rushford.
The red Devil, led by Ale Gunnar Surshire, has been forced to go out with 2 wins and 22 defeats in the league and have been challenged by the quality of the front line.
It was Honda that the Australian media named it as a new force candidate for Teko.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, the contract of Honda as a creative side player can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Perilla."
The 9 points in the 18th game in Melbourne Victory are "hard records" but "The 33-year-old Honda has been pointed out to be away from his entertainment to manage Cambodia's representatives and needs to get full attention."
What is the approach of Honda?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move due to the veteran that the Tokyo Olympic Games will be held next year.

Now Naoto Ikemura Hitoshi is no longer required to increase the first shot.
Mr. Caddy's best shot today
The 1W shot is not necessarily tick-up.
There's also a technique called the so-called "direct-dra" that you want to make a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance in the second shot of Par 5.
In recent years the 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of the ball scatters, but there are players who often practice this on the ground.
The first victory of the tour is the Heike Village.
The 24th year of the 7th year is now the 7th place (average 304.02 yd) in the driving force sector, while the 24th year of the professional is small with a height of 166cm.
While focusing on the long shot, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In the early spring, "I thought that I would try to do a straight dryer because I was not able to shoot a spoon (three-way).
From the exercise round, you can drop the ball on the grass in the Ti area, and you can also turn 1W.
In cases where the Big Catry is required, it is often used to make direct do with narrow holes.
It can be used in a hall where the eyes are down.
In the bullet road measuring instrument, the calysses record 270 yd and 280yd.
"So I don't have a 3W, so I can make it safer than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, the wood in the Caddy bag is only 1W.
The second longest club is the 17th UT.
The battle method that is surprised by the tour buddies is also pleased with the feeling of leaking from the gallery.
It is said that the club moves horizontally.
"Even with the down blow, I don't fly straight at the upper level, I went to the right of the cut track, which was originally going to make a fix on the swing correction of the 1W shot at the time of Tiup."
The ball is not caught and the risk of the slice is "So the left side can be erased (not bent on the left).
It's a professional skill that says Kantan...

Wed shot in Garcia
I thought that it would be possible to reach the momentum in the second half of the first half, but it was regrettable because it was not so good.
Did you see the 6th Eagle, the 7th Bardi championship?
After the 4th episode of Boggy, there was also 5 per person, so when I was playing with the feeling of returning, the chip in the 6th place.
Even in the seventh place, Bardi was caught and it became a chance, but it was regrettable that it did not stretch in the second half.
What have you done now?
It was good to be able to make a solid key even in a narrow course because it was not so good recently.

What is the way to prevent dementia?
Report, sentence, Yoro Watanabe.
A large pharmaceutical company and a university hospital are challenged by research and development, and the drugs of dementia are failing.
However, the relationship between dementia and living habits has been clarified, and it seems that there is a possibility that it can be kept at a very mild age.
Kinki University Hospital Dr. Toshisuke Otsuki talked to the students.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation? - Prevention of dementia, or treatment of the drugs are waiting for?
Otsuki From mild to severe, there is a difference in the degree that everyone may become dementia after ageing.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The medicine used in Japan is already out of insurance in some countries overseas and cannot be expected to have a remarkable effect.
On the other hand, death due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have been reduced due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
It is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to resolve by yourself or family, but it is necessary to create an environment that can live in peace with the community as a whole.
How to keep "get things"?
Is there a person who is easy to become dementia?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that it can be kept as much as "getting things".
Dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be one of the most prone people.
First, the metabolites tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects economic power.
For example, the United States may distribute food tickets to the poor, but food that can be saved is hamburgers, pizza and chicken.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where cooking is not possible are available.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased against lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, it becomes poor, but obese, and the body becomes indiscriminate only by watching TV.
The same situation may be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think of things tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things from day to day.
