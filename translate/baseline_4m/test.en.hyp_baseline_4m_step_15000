Driving in high heels is dangerous!
There are a number of accidents that take the pedal of young people (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!
A violation of road traffic law.
It is a big mistake to think that only the elderly drivers are the problem.
In the number of cases in which the pedal-taking accident occurs (2015 National Police Agency data), the number of more than 1080 cases under the age of 24 have been over the age of 75 and over 1032 cases.
It's not a big mistake for the elderly, but it's important to call attention to the younger generation.
How do I take the tail of the foot?
Do you take safety?
This data is not included in the ratio of men and women, but it is different from those of the elderly who are often considered to come from the decline of the body such as driving skills and reflex nerves.
In particular, women often choose different shoes depending on the dress of the day, such as high heels, panps, sandals, mulls, and so on.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people are cumbersome to change their shoes, but some people do not think of it at all, and there are many people driving without hesitation.
However, driving in the high heels and Sandals often touches the road traffic law.
The first is to ensure the operation of the handle, brake and other operations, and Article 70 of "No driving to harm the person with the accident shall not be carried out".
The other is the Article 71 "Computes of the Public Security Committee" which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters specified by the prefectural government's Public Security Committee, which for convenience the enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Act, in Article 12 "Do not wear any footwear that hinders the operation of such equipment, slipper, high heels, or other vehicles" (excluding cars).
It is similar to that in each prefecture, the purpose of which is considered to be a violation of driving in the "wear that may interfere with driving operation" until not specified as high heels.
Why is it dangerous to drive in a high heels?
It is obvious if you consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For the safe and secure pedal operation, first place the foot on the floor and put the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot as the foot point when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that no matter how the car works.
However, in the high heels, the area is small and the area is grounded on the floor is small, and it is always played with a gravure, and the area of the foot ground on the pedal is also small, so it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull a high heel, and when it comes to a sudden brake, the heel is not pulled, and the heel is pulled, and the heel is pulled off, and the heel can not cross the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is a case that heels take the pedal back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The local industry of Hyogo and Awaji Island, and the Kinki Ceramics of the "Awaji Koku" production application for a quasi-self bankruptcy application of approximately 20 billion yen (the Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo! News
The decline in housing market conditions and the damage of the severe earthquake caused the "consumption of consumer tiles" to move on.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Companies Code: 530173983, Capital of 920 million yen, Otani 8881-8, Hyogo Prefecture), representative Fukuhara Yukizo, and 44 employees applied for a quasi-self bankruptcy to the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The application agent is Yoshida Daishi (Nishitenman 1-10-8, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka-shi, and Yoshida Daiso Law Office, telephone 06-665-6038).
The company was established in June 1895 (Meiji 28) and was reorganized as a subsidiary in April 1961.
Originally, he started his business as a local manufacturer of Awaji Island in Nishi-Awaji-cho (present-day Minamiawaji City) in Nishiki-machi (present-day Minamiawaji City).
In October 1986, the company succeeded in the business of the Kinki Industry, which was the merger of the absorption of the Kyowa kiln business, and changed its name to the present business.
After that, they established sales bases in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was established.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases in the center of West Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
As a top tile manufacturer of Awaji Island, he had a considerable reputation.
However, since the Lehman shock, housing market conditions have been sluggish, the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the Kumamoto earthquake have caused consumers to move away from the roof.
In addition to the decline in the profit margin associated with the surge in fuel prices, the company had a continuous deficit with excessive interest in stock prices and business fixed investment.
For this reason, although the Bank of Japan requested the Bank to ease the repayment conditions of the loans, the Bank of Japan decided to rebuild the business.
The Bank decided not to support the project and decided to continue it.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

What is "beauty and ugly"?
What is the image of "Song" (Mammix) - Yahoo! News
What is the combination of the mystical beauty and the expression of the shadow in?
Since the 1950s, he has sent a number of works to the world, and in August 2019, he introduced the beauty girls drawn by Dr. Yujime, who is known as the first person of the fear manga.
When you look at it, you will be reminded of the correlation between "mi" and "hazard" of the work that you do not see.
[Image] It is attractive because there is a shadow.
There are five beautiful girls who do not have a picture.
In the chapter of the "Mid Girl Collection", there was a single statement that "the fear, the uglyness, the shocking scene of the story, and the beauty of the girls in the polar opposite pole stand out, but the beautiful face is strained, and the expression of the grudges that have been put in mind ... may stand out.
Although there is a keyword "shake" that appears in many works that do not appear in the picture, the snake is captured by the person who sees it as a "uneasy living creature" or "beautiful" people are different from receiving.
There are people who like reptiles in the world, but there are people who do not like them.
In this way, depending on the sensibility of the person you see, "mi" and "dirty" may be a "jay" creature.
In addition, this creature has been revered as a living creature with a high level of spiritual power since ancient times.
In his work, he has a series of works based on the theme of "The Snake" and a series of "Momakoi!".
It is the market for a woman with a shadow.
It's nice to say that it's a "cool-buckty" type ... it feels like the similarities between the girls who appear in the picture.
Among them, "Orochi" is the main character of "Orochi", which has been serialized in the Weekly Boys' Day since 1969, but it is a representative character of the work of the Akebono, but it is reminiscent of a snake that is deeply asleep every hundred years to maintain eternal life and eternal youth.

[Etsuyama Wakamizu] A circle of "Children's Dining" that offers children free or inexpensive meals is spread throughout the country.
According to a survey conducted by NPOs and other organizations, there are 3700 locations nationwide this year.
It has increased by one to six times compared to 2018 and has increased to nine places in Fukui Prefecture.
Why is it a children's cafeteria now?
Makoto Yuasa, the chairman of the NPO corporation and social activist, talked about the background and significance in a lecture held in Sakai City.
The area became lonely due to the declining birthrate and aging population, and the shopping street declined.
There is no place to meet people.
Therefore, there was a need for a regional exchange base where people would be able to get together.
It is a "multi-generation exchange place" where you can participate even in the elderly.
It not only eliminates food, but also leads to child-rearing support and the health of the elderly.
I cut the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
It is important to say, "I don't make children who are left behind."
There are a variety of places that offer meals every day from once a month.
The scale is from a few to a few hundred people, and the venue is also a wide variety of different kinds from the private house to the temple.
The atmosphere of people who want to do is now being created.
The lowness of such a living room is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure operational expenses and staff.
You may also hear issues such as a safe management system.
Even though it is a case, "It changes values by interacting with a lot of people." "It is a safety net when connecting with society is a disaster," Yuasa says.
It seems like a light of hope to be closed society.

It can be manufactured at low cost, and it is about 1000 km long.
It is also a strength that is difficult to capture radars because of the low-flying sky."
On September 14th, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, "Saudi Ramco", was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fukui" issued a statement of the crime.
"The fact behind the Fushi is that Iran, led by President Rouhani, is no doubt that Iran will not allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil in a state where its own country is unable to export crude oil."If Iran continues to take a crude oil embargo against Iran, it will aim to inform the international community that the pain will accompany it."
In response to the bombing, half of the oil production in Saudi Arabia stopped, and crude oil prices rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock will come again.
"Trump has publicly stated the withdrawal of the US military from the Middle East, so I would like to avoid military interventions until at least next year's elections are over.In this regard, Iran will continue to be bombed by drones hiding the Fushi, and the U.S. will not be able to endure any time."

The reason why YouTuber has become a regular employee.
Listen to the president who has adopted (bizzSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 Delivery
YouTuber is now the most popular among young people.
Although it is not unusual for companies to use it for advertising their products, there is a company that started a rare " YouTuber adoption" that is adopted as a regular employee.
Direct Marketing Mix (DmMiX) is a direct marketing mix (hereinafter, "DmMiX") which is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to do with YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, the Representative Director of DmMiX, and who is the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber this time.
I would like to cheer young people who are working hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism do you do in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (Kobayashi) : Now YouTuber is a profession that has become a fan of many young people.
The number of young people who aim for the future is increasing.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, it is the " YouTuber adoption" to adopt young people who are chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber.
When you think of YouTuber, there is an image that an individual voluntarily posts a video, but why did you decide to use it?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire YouTuber's profession, most YouTuber is a reality that YouTuber doesn't seem to be profitable.
There are also a few creators who have been making videos and postings while working as part-time jobs, as well as those who do not admit YouTuber to their family.
In this effort, the creators who have adopted this work provide the environment for payroll and content production.
At the beginning, I believe that we will support YouTuber's professional disadvantage, which is a very unstable position.

[Bad Games in the first half of the race] The world's King, Kento Momota, and the strong Zhouzhuang are leading a step.
Men's singles< (Bad × Spirit!)
The Japanese national team who won six victories at Badminton's Big Event held in August, the 25th World Championships (Swiss Basel) will compete in China's OP (Thailand / Super 1000), which will be held in early September.
Here, we look back at the first half of the Olympic race that took part in the Tokyo Olympics next year from May to August, and look forward to the men's singles for the mid-field game (September to December) (written by the badminton magazine Editorial Department).
The Olympic race in Badminton, which started in May, was digested by the top four tournaments (super 500 or more) when the world championship was finished.
The first game in the first half was played by Kento Momota, who won the 2nd prize in the 4th tournament, and two Taiwanese Zhou Tensei (Cheng Tienchen).
Momota is a world championship and Zhou Tiansei won a tournament where high points of "World Ranking Point" are directly linked to the Olympic race.
In addition to that, Momota also has a JapanOP (S750).
The tournament that has been held since May is the fourth round of the World Championship (May/China), the Indonesian OP (July/August) and JapanOP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of other top players is less than that, it is probably a schedule that has reduced the burden on the body.
Since August was only one of the world championship tournaments, it would not be much more fatigue than the consecutive war.
In the mid-field competition since September, it is necessary to make good results.
Taiwan's ace that is strong in the fight.
It is also attracting attention to young Thai people!
He has also won the top prize in Indonesia's OP and Thailand OP (S500) and has already won seven tournaments.
In September, he joined the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the prize.
Originally, the physical is strong, and the players who do not suffer the fight.
Even if the competition continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the match.
Rather, it's easy to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by getting a high point in the first half.
It was the impression that Zhou Tiansei had no explosive power until last year, but due to the increase in the stability of the play this year, he was able to continue his good performance.
For Momoda, the world's first ranking, it seems to be more disappointing than ever.
In addition to these two players, they left the results in the first half of the game in Thailand with the young Ace Canterbury and India's Cyplanneys B.
And he is the third player of the Underus Antonsen, who is struggling for the independence as a European leader.
Although Kantafon has not entered the finals in the top-level competition, he has won the best in the second season.
There is still a rough side, but 20 years old (21 years old on the 18th) when the rally was reached with the top players, etc., are likely to leap in the Olympic race.
In addition, Sai Praneys B. is one step away in India, where you can enjoy the singles.
There is also the Slican Ki Dambi, which has been late at Kega, and it is necessary to pay attention to the situation in India since the middle battle.
New rates on mobile phones We will lower the price in a fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun How to use the Shin-Elec Edition?
The new rate plan for the mobile phone company following the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Act in October was released.
However, it was generally closed.
In the summer of last year, Mr. Yoshikazu Suga said, "There is room to lower about 40 percent," and despite the high expectations for a lower value, the price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor in the fact that the full-scale entry of Rakuten is being forwarded and the three major companies remain in a state of oligo.
For consumers, it is desirable to be an easy-to-use fee system due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on terminal and communication fees.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to be higher.
SOFTBANK and KDDI (au) announced a plan to make up the terminal at least half.
However, both of the two companies have a system called "SIM lock" which can not be used for 100 days.
NTT Docomo is one-third of the terminal type for only the contract holder on the line.
The three companies will continue to "i enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications expressed its policy to require immediate cancellation.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was because the maintenance of the communication network, such as the base station, did not proceed as planned.
Because it was expected to be a blasting agent for a low-priced competition, it was a cool appearance.
There was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start time of the full-scale service and the fees are not revealed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility and work on the business.
The price revision was the result of Mr. Suga's speech.
Mr. Suga commented on the new fees of the three companies, "I think that competition will begin in the future, and I did not think that it is good at all."
However, it does not seem that the lowering of government-made values will slow the market and encourage sound competition.
Before the company comes out of the government, it is necessary to develop a customer-oriented competition.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The consumer agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer burden exceeds half of the amount, although the terminal has been advertising such as "maximum half."
Companies themselves must be careful and easy-to-understand explanation to avoid misunderstandings of users.

[Roader W Cup] A one-off stop and fight against the U.S. players' face-to-face danger tackle" overseas ripple "Aggressive and inferior play" (THE ANSWER) - Yahoo!
The U.S. FLV is not called "Takru", the former England representative.
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) tournament was held on 26th, and the United States, which was the last appearance in 20 countries, lost in 7-45 in England.
It became a black star, but in the second half, a rough play played by the FLion Quill is called a ripple.
In the form of adding a shoulder tackle to the face of the other person, one exit is made.
The real scene is also published with a video, and the former team of England has a bitter saying that it is not a tacre.
[Video] "It's a shameless play" and the overseas ripple!
In the event of a breakout, the two military players are in turmoil ... the real moment of the "face risk tackle" played by the U.S. representative Quil.
The hot struggle has gone beyond one line.
It is 29 minutes in the second half of the year.
In the enemy, Farrrell, the head of England, had a somewhat balanced balance to catch the path of ally.
I went to Tacru for this, but it was a light.
However, he raised his body not from his waist but on his upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the other person are in contact, and the shape of the head.
Farrell was violently blown away and fell.
In fact, the English player is a fierce protest against the lack of legitimacy.
The two players gathered at once and became the air of a touch.
The result of the TMO (video decision) is a red card, and the candle is a red card.
After the pitch with a bad face, some people were asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" of New Zealand, which is a strong rugby player, features the "Road W Cup 2019: The U.S. player is devoid of play and the headlines that England is a pleasure.
"Kill is a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English Star Farrrell, and has become a retreat."
In the article, we will introduce the comments of the commentator Hugo Mogna in the former England representative.
"It's insulting, it's not a fool, and it's not a tough play."
The U.S., which lacks one match, managed to escape the defeat of the game by taking a try of 81 minutes.
But the play of the candle left the bad taste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced its name for the first time that the number of hospitals in Japan, including the 1455 public hospitals and the JRCS, was weak.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare examined the treatment of 14 public hospitals and has four facilities in Wakatakahama Hospital, Wagahama-cho, Oda Hospital in Joetsuchi-cho.
⇒ Four Hospitals for Restruction "Creatives"
In order to reduce the medical expenses that expand in the aging population, it was necessary to promote the reorganization and integration of the hospital in the competing region.
In October, he asked for a full-fledged review of the reorganization and integration of the target hospital, and decided to conclude the meeting by September next year.
It is not a force, but it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsive from the anxiety that the hospital will be closed.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The target hospital was 29 percent of the total number of beds, with a relatively low number of hospitals.
In each prefecture, Niigata (53 to 7 percent), Hokkaido (48-6 percent), Miyagi (47-5 percent), Yamaguchi (66%) and Okayama (43-3 percent) were higher.
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, based on data in FY2017, surveyed 1455 hospitals that respond to the "acute period" for patients with severe acute care, and the "acute period" for general surgery.
We analyzed the medical results of nine items such as cancer and emergency medical care and the fact that a competing hospital would not be a place within 20 minutes by car, and judged the necessity of the hospital's announcement.
In the hospital, you will be able to consider the abolition of the hospital and the transfer of some medical departments to other hospitals.
The medical expenses will increase in the 25th year of the year when all of the baby boomers are over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in 1246,000 beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds in the hospital.
Currently, there are a large number of beds in the "Advanced Acute Period" and "acute Period", where the nurses are placed thickly, while the elderly are lacking in rehabilitation.
It is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds in order to respond to the aging population, but also to increase the number of beds.
Regarding the reorganization and integration of the hospital, each prefecture has formulated a "regional medical plan" which sets the number of beds necessary for 25 years.
Many local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to make an active contribution to the discussion by announcing a hospital name with a low track record.

Ikemura Hiroshi is no longer required to increase the first shot.
Today's Kadi's best shot.
The one-W shot is not necessarily achievable.
There is also a so-called "re-dra" technique that you don't want to make a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance in the second round of per person.
In recent years, 1W has a large head volume, so there is a risk of ball being scattered, but there are players who often practice on the ground.

From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only one W in the candy bag.
The second longest club is the UT at the Loft 17°C.
The fight, which can be surprised by the tour companions, is also a happy voice of lamenting the leakage from the gallery.
It is said that Kotz is going to shake the club to a level.
"In the down-blo, even if you hit the upper, you don't fly straight, but it's a cut track right.I originally did a 1W-shot swing correction (at the time of tiup) to perform this practice, the attack angle (the angle of the club's injection) would be moderate."
The ball is not caught, and the risk of the slice is accompanied by the "So the left side is removed (not to the left).

[Video] Come to Japan.
Wed shot in Garcia
I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I was not able to stretch the pattern so it was regrettable.
Did you see the 6th Eagle, the 7th Bardi win?
Even after hitting the buggy in the fourth place, the per5 was left, so if you feel it was returned, the tip-in- Eagle was added.
Even in the seventh place, Bardi was able to get the chance, but it was regrettable that it wasn't until the second half.
What did you get to the competition now?
Because it was not good in recent years (shots), it was good to be able to make a clear key even in a narrow course.
Because the rafts were also in the opposite direction and roses, it was a course where the distance was changed.
What is the difference between the regular tournaments?
There was a chance to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but if you were a pretty gallery, I was taking a video.
I didn't have any other changes, but I just co-organized a few Japanese players, so that's why I decided to play the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to foreign players."
The second half of the race will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you don't want to win the prize money, so there is a ZOZO championship in close proximity, so I will try to get the top prize in the competition so that I can win.
What is the way to prevent dementia and to keep it in the "getting" degree?
Interview, Text / Watanabe Yo.
A major pharmaceutical company and university hospital challenge the research and development process, and it is a drug that is frustrated.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it seems that it may be possible to keep it at a very mild age and to be forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital I heard about Professor Toshisuke Otsuki of the Graduate School of Brain Science.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a difference between the degree and the age of everyone.
However, it is thought that it will take more than twenty years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, it is already out of insurance adaptation, and it is not possible to expect a remarkable completion effect.
On the other hand, death due to infectious diseases and accidents has been reduced, and cancer death has also declined due to a remarkable progress in treating anti-cancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that patients with dementia are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by themselves or by family, but it is necessary to create an environment where people can live safely in the community as a whole.
How to "getting"?
Is there a person who is easy to be diagnosed with dementia or a person who is difficult to do?
Otsuki Even if it is unavoidable to be diagnosed with dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and to be kept at the "getting of things."
The disease is thought to be one of the lifestyle-related diseases, and it tends to be people who are easy to make.
First, Metabos tends to be easily diagnosed with dementia.
The disease is perceived as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hyper cholesterol.
The absence of economic power is also affected.
For example, in the United States, there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets can be used for food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizza and chicken.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people who live in an environment where food is not available.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased in lipids and sugars.
When it comes to poverty, it becomes obese, and if you think about it, you can only see the TV, and the body becomes free.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
In addition, people who don't think of things, and those who don't work tend to be dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read the book from day to day and think about things.
