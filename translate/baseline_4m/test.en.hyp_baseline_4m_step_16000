Japan's men's 100th round of the World Athletics 2 | At the Shizuoka Newspaper

It's dangerous to drive in high heels.
A number of young people's pedal-taking accidents (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!
Acts that violate road traffic laws.
The number of reports of an accident caused by malfunctioning, such as a pedal step mistake, is a great mistake to think of it as a matter of elderly drivers.
In recent years, the number of pedal-free accidents (2015 police station data) has more than 1032 cases, with more than 24 years old.
It is not always common to the elderly, and it is important to pay attention to the younger generation as well.
Do you take the tail of your feet?
Is it safe?
There is no indication of gender or cause of this data, but unlike elderly people who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflex nerves, young people may have misrepresented by other things such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes, such as high heels, breadps, sandals, and mulls, and that day's clothes, and run it.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people are reluctant to change their wear, but others do not think of the potential to be dangerous, and many of them are running unsatisfactorily.
However, the operation of the high heels and sandals usually touches the road traffic laws.
One is to "fully manipulate the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations", and Article 70 of the "not to be able to drive to harm the person in the accident".
Another example is Article 71 of the "Compliance of the Public Safety Commission" in which the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the National Safety Commission, for example, in Article 12 of the Road Transport Act of Miyazaki Prefecture, "weavy, Slippers, Slippers, Heals, High Heals, and others, wearing some of the shoes in such a way that prevents the operation from running, or driving it."
It is similar to the fact that each of the prefectures, even if they do not specify the high heels, would violate the operation of "the footwear that may interfere with the operation".
Why is it dangerous to drive with a high heels?
It is clear to consider the basics of pedal operation safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, the foot or foot is fixed on the floor, and the foot is vertical to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the foot is tilted to the right as a footpoint.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, the surface of a high heels is small enough to land on the floor, and it is always a graph and abreast of the feet at the height of the heels, so the foot area surrounding the pedals is small, and it is difficult to finely adjust.
This is considered dangerous.
There is also a floor carpet on most cars, but this material is easy to pull a high heel, and when it is a quick brakes, the heel pulls the pedal, or the heel pulls, and the high heel can be removed from the beat, and it may not turn into the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is also a case where the heels are pulled to the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is gone.

"The Iranian drone, Aba Beer, used in the bombing, has recently improved dramatically by analyzing the crashed U.S. drone.
It is inexpensive and can be manufactured, and is about 1000 km long.
It's also hard to catch radars because of the low sky."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, the Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Soon after, the Yemeni anti-government organization Hosi issued a statement.
"It is no doubt that Iran, under the leadership of President Lowhani, will not allow Saudi Arabia to profit from crude oil in the circumstances where its own country is unable to export crude oil; if Iran continues to carry out the embargo on crude oil, it will be directed to the international community to be informed that the pain corresponding to it is accompanied."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production ceased, and the oil prices had risen by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock comes again.
"Since Trump has publicly committed the withdrawal of the United States from the Middle East, at least until the end of the next year's election, it will avoid any military intervention, and Iran will continue to hide the Hoosics, and the U.S. will not be able to stand at any time."

The reason for the superpersonal YouTuber being a positive employee.
He asked the president to adopt (bizSPACE).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47.
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
While it is not uncommon for companies to use their own products for advertising, there are companies that have started an unusual mechanism called "Toyber" to employ them as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of the company's customer relationship management.
What is it?
He was DmMiX CEO, and this time he heard from Yuki Kobayashi, who was also a representative of YouTuber's subsidiary, First Staff.
I want to support young people working hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism do you think of YouTuber?
Yuki Kobayashi: Today, YouTuber's profession is a long-standing youth.
It is also the top professional ranking for elementary school students to pursue their careers in the future, and will continue to increase the number of young people they want.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have driven dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, a young man who pursues the dream of becoming a YouTuber is to use YouTuber.
YouTuber has an image that an individual voluntarily post a video, but why do you intend to adopt it?
Kobayashi: While many young people have longed for YouTuber's profession, most YouTubers have a reality that they do not have any income they thought.
There are few creators who are working on video production and posting as well as those who do not allow their family to be YouTuber.
This effort provides the creators who have adopted the environment for pay and content production.
At first, we want to support YouTuber's professional disadvantage by supporting us.

Assistant U.S. Secretary of State for Japan (South Korea) stated on 27 November that "We hope that South Korea will rethink and return the decision to return to South Korea" on 23 November, in response to a single interview by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
It is unusual for the U.S. High Commissioner to refer to the destruction of GSOMIA.
The GSOMIA is based on the Japanese-South Korea, the United States, and the United States, as well as the sharing of missile launch information.
South Korea informs that the agreement between Japan will be revoked in August, and if it is lost, a framework for protecting military information in Japan and South Korea will collapse.
Napper contends that "without GSOMIA can't respond effectively to the crisis."
"There is time to lose", he strongly urged South Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by Mid-Russia in July indicated the threat recognition that it was "the first time in history" and that "It is vital for the United States and South Korea to share values such as democracy and human rights to join the alliance."
The recent deterioration in South Korea's relations has been "damaged in the interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of mediation", he said, "We will play a positive role for the Japanese to be separated."

The First Battle of the Bad Olympics: The King of the World, the King of Taota, and the good heavens!
"Bad × Spirit!"
In August, Badminton's big event, the Japan national team won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Swisss Basel), ending the early September reinforced camp and joining the China OP (Super 1000) which opened on 17 August.
Here, while looking back on the first half of the game from May to August, which began the next year at the Tokyo Olympics, he was looking forward to the male singles for the mid-term (September to December).
The Badminton Olympic race, which began in May, digested the Top Player's competition (super500 or more) at the end of the World Championships.
In the first round, he would have won two victories during the four races, and two of the Taiwanese racemen.
Momoda won the World Championships and the Grand Prix of Zhouten can win the Indonesian OOP (S1000) and the high points of the "World Ranking Point" directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also has Japan OP (S750).
The competition from May to May was the Sdirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesian OP (July / Results 16) and JapanOP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although there are fewer than the other top players, the schedule is likely to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only the World Championships were held, so fatigue would not be much better than the war.
A good result of a continuous mid-term battle is required after September.
Ace in Taiwan is strong in the fight.
The young people of Thailand are also interested.
He also won the top championships in Indonesia's OP and Thailand (S500) and was already in seven competitions.
He also participated in the September 2012 local Taipei OP (S300) and won the prize.
It was originally hard to fight and did not suffer.
Even after the competition, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, by gaining high points in the first round, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the competition.
Zhouten's impression was that it lacked explosive power until last year, but with the increased stability of play this year, he was able to continue his good performance.
For the world's top-ranked peaches, he seems to be more than ever disappointed.
Other than the two players, they left the results in the first round, with Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cyclones B.
He is a three-player of Andus Antonsen, who is fighting for the rest of Europe.
Kangaphon has not been able to reach the finals in the higher competitions, but he has won the top of the competition, such as entering the best of the second tournament.
Although there is still a rough surface, the 20-year-old (21-year-old) that Larry was able to compete with top players would have a great chance of leaping in the Olympic race.
Sai Planetys B. was also a step away from India, where he had a good player in singles.
As Salamama, Plauy H.S., and Slican Kidambi, who was too late at Kega, is now being pushed forward, attention must be paid to India since the mid-war period.
A new price for a mobile phone: a fair competition: the Hokkaido Newspapers how the electronic edition is.
A new fee plan for the mobile phone company, following the enactment of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was largely stopped.
In the summer of last year, Secretary of State Kanyi said that "there is room for about 40% of the cost", and despite the high expectations of the price decline, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor in the fact that the full entry of the heavens is forwarded and the three largest olivines remain.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fair competition to make it easier to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits a set discount on terminal and communication fees.
Instead of selling the price of the terminal, it was set to be more expensive.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the device up to half.
However, both companies use the SIM lock for 100 days, and the SIM lock is used for terminals.
NTT Docomo makes up to one-third of its terminals for only its own contractors.
It appears that the three companies continue to "interrange" to prevent transfers to other companies.
For SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that it would require immediate cancellation.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in the heavens was due to the lack of the base station and other communication networks as planned.
Because it was expected to be a trigger for a price reduction competition, it was so cool to shoulder.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The start and fees of the full service were not revealed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want to work on business with responsibility.
This revision led to the remarks of Secretary General Suga.
Suga expressed dissatisfaction with the three company's new charges: "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's right to do so."
However, the "committee value" does not seem to have the market relaxed and promote sound competition.
Before the company is out of the government, it should develop a customer-oriented competition.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The consumer agency called for attention, as the terminal has more than half the cost of the consumer, despite advertising such as "maximum half".
It is necessary to make an easy-to-understand explanation of the company itself, so as not to misinterpret the user.
Reduced to a maximum of 50 million yen.
The three credit safes in Mie Prefecture (Knowowloon Trust Bank, Northern Ise Ueno) announced on 26 December that they had decided to reduce the amount of cash cards to prevent special fraud.
He holds a cash card for each credit card in the North, Ise Ueno, and Ki-North Korea, and for the last three years the maximum amount of money to depositers over 70 years who have never paid more than a certain amount of money for ATMs (a cash-receiving machine) is 50 million yen per day for cash cards.
The Kumami-Mitsubishi Bank and the Northern Ise Ueno Trust Bank will be reduced from 1 November to 1 November.
In the prefecture, a number of special fraud cases issued by ATMs, including cash cards and police officials, have been taken over, and credit cards are said to be "to protect the customer's valuable deposit in the way possible."
He is moved to the Rival Room, including the Rikuzuru, and is the sudden death of the Izumi | The Shizuoka newspaper At Esashi
The Japanese Sumo Society announced on 27 November that following the death of the Izumo family (former Guanyin) he had approved a transfer of three people in the Izumo and the Izumo Room, and one of the land-backed rooms.
The land back room is the same as the Izumi room.
The master's land-home (former Daguan Kirishima) is from the Izuke room and is the brother of the deceased.
The family died on 16 June, and the cranes were at the same time in the mirror room, and future treatment was discussed.
On the back of the land, there are a dozen mountaines from Mongolia, and at the time of autumn there are 12 people.
"W Rugby World Cup": Departure & Fighting against U.S. players in the face-to-face danger tacru ("The International SWER").
U.S. FLKil is not able to call Lafplay, the former English national "Tuckle".
The Japan World Rugby World Cup (W Cup) played 26 days, and the United States, which was the last in 20 countries, lost 7–45 in England.
Although it became a black star, later Lafplay performed by FL John Quill called the ripple.
It is ejected in a form of adding a shoulder tuckle to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene was released with a video, and former English players were suffering from "a humiliating and poor play" and "not calling it a tackle".
The video is "a humiliating and obscene play" and a foreign ripple!
At one point out, both players are in turmoil ... the actual moment of the "face dangerous tactle" played by the U.S. national Quill.
A hot battle was over.
It is 29 minutes to arrive at 0-38.
The enemy was deep and the English captain Farrell had a somewhat balanced time to catch the path of his allies.
I went to Tuckl, but it was a quail.
However, he raised his body not below his waist, and he put his body on the upper half.
The result is the contact of the head and head of the opponent and the shape of the head.
Farrell was badly blown and fell.
It was apparently a fierce protest against the lack of legitimacy in the play that the English players were trying to escape the Kyle.
Both players gathered at once and became a touch-up air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), the Kil is ejected by a red card.
Batz left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the crowd seeking a fair play were heard of him.
New Zealand's local media "staff" featured headlines: " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for a poor play, and England's victory."
"Kill had a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and was dropped out," he said, "It was almost a struggle by both players."
In the article, he introduced a comment by former English player Hugo Moña of commentators.
He said, "It's an insult, and it's not a fool."
The United States, lacking a single match, managed to escape the defeat in the 81st attempt.
However, Quill's play left a bad taste.
On 26 September, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first of the 424 hospitals in the state that the state's 1455 public hospitals and the public hospitals, such as the Japanese Red and Red, were determined to be "no medical experience".
In Fukui Prefecture, four facilities were covered by the Ministry of Labor's Public and Public Hospital 14, and the National Hospital of the City of Yam straw, the city's National Hospital, Yambai City Hospital, in the town of Oda Hospital in the past.
The four hospitals for the reorganization were "commonly wrong".
In order to curb the aging and growing medical costs, it was decided that it would be necessary to promote the reorganization and integration of hospitals in competing areas.
In October, he asked for a full-scale review of the reorganization and consolidation of the hospital, and by September of that year, he would conclude.
There is no force, but anxiety about the loss of familiar hospitals is expected to lead local mayors and residents.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The hospital had a total of 29 percent and had relatively few beds.
According to prefectures, Niigata (53–7 percent), Hokkaido (48–6 percent), Miyagi (47–5 percent), Yamaguchi (46–7 percent), Okayama (43–3 percent).
The number was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
The Ministry of Labor, based on the data of the 2017 fiscal year, examined 1455 hospitals capable of responding to the "highly acute phase" of public and public hospitals for severe patients, and the "acute period" of general surgery.
He analyzed the nine items of treatment, such as cancer and emergency medicine, as well as the location of competing hospitals within 20 minutes of the car, and determined the need to publish hospital names.
Hospitals that are subject to the subject are considered to be repealed or to transfer some clinics to other hospitals.
The cost of medical care increased in 25 years, when all of the band's people were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has a goal of reducing the number of beds in a hospital of 1246,000 beds (18 years) to 13,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high-acute phase" and "acute phase" for nurses, while the elderly lack the need for higher rehabilitation.
In response to the aging population, it is necessary to not only reduce the number of beds, but also increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of the hospital, each county has created a "regional medical concept" that sets the number of beds needed for 25 years.
While the country is divided into 339 areas, municipalities and health officials discuss it, many of the local residents and mayors maintain a cautious stance, and debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Labor wants to promote debate by publishing the name of a hospital with little experience.
Imagine the eruption of Mt. Koke, the road, and other disaster-combating training in the area, the first time in 18 years (video) : Hokkaido Newspapers
A comprehensive disaster drill, intended for the eruption of Mount Koke (1131 meters), took place on September 27, in the forest, seven rice, and the town of Kabe.
There were about 400 people, including 20 staff and residents of 20 institutions, including roads and three towns.
The Hokkaido Kokodake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council has been the first to hold since August to formulate evacuation plans for residents.
A wide range of training for residents was the first in 18 years.
At 8:45 a.m., it was assumed that Mount Koke had erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the alert level was raised to 5 (vacuees), a shelter was opened in the woods and seven-way towns, and the residents moved by busses and guard vehicles prepared by each town.
In Vancouver's climate demonstration, 100,000 students sued for school breaks and global warming (everybody's economic newspaper network) – Yahoo!
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with the 16-year-old environmental activist Grega Thumbley, marched in Vancouver on 27 September to protest against climate change.
The climate demonstrations in Vancouver have occurred.
The march took over the Canby Bridge from the Vancouver City Hall to the downtown library.
Before the city hall, people with plastic cards began to gather before the start hours, and at 13 o'clock at the start of the city hall, the number was enough to fill the road for several blocks.
The number of participants continued to increase and more than 100,000 people participated.
On the road, the police also collaborated on road regulations and watched them all for hours before they completed walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City, the city hosts many events that consider global warming from the previous weekend.
On the last day, the school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school rested on that day complained to adults that they wanted to protect the Earth until they rested on the school, and many of the people who took part in the rest of the day responded that "we will do our best for the future of the children who are seriously learning."
Nine areas recommended by the Pork cholera vaccine, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Ginha Newspaper Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on 27 November an amendment to the Anti-Visitution Guidelines that would allow preventive vaccination of unaccepted pigs in the current state to prevent the spread of the epidemic of the pig.
The area is intended to select nine counties, such as Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boar infections have been confirmed.
Transport such as live pigs and fertilized eggs that have been vaccinated is limited to the region, but distribution of meat and processed goods is permitted outside the region.
After public comments (appropriations) to the general public, the process will be completed as early as October.
The use of vaccines and the availability of meat and other external distributions would not be a "clean country" recognized by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since September last year, Japan's status as a clean-up country was temporarily suspended.
In the revised draft, the Ministry of Agriculture set up a "vaccinated area" based on experts' opinions regarding areas with high risk of infection to pigs from wild bonosi.
The target county created a "vaccination program" that sums up the range, time, head number, and way of vaccination, and allows it to be used by the governor.
The other seven counties listed as an inoculation are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.
When the region is amended, it is determined to review the situation.
Moves such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and pests are limited to the region in principle.
For meat and processed goods, it is not subject to the cost of distribution and the impact of farmers, and effectively allows for distribution outside the region.
To prevent the spread of viruses, it is possible to thoroughly process food waste.
He appealed for the safety of the pigs he had been vaccinated, and was also committed to preventing wind damage.
The amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day, and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defence Headquarters.
In the future, public comments and opinions of the prefecture will be issued until 7 October, and a new warning will be implemented.
It's a public approach to ManU!
"We don't need money" ( Football Channel) – Yahoo!
9/28 (Sat) 257 distributions.
As far as last season, he left Melbourne Bactley at the Australian A.League, and the former Japan national team, the MF Honta Keiyu, is now an amazing action.
How to play the game?
The truth of the heavens is revealed.
At midnight on 27 October, Honda introduced his own Twitter, saying, "We don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other party who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, the world's leading figure.
Why did Honda make a grand request for the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
The result was in an Australian edition of the Australian edition FOX Sport, released on 24 December.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could seize in the crisis of the wounded", five non-member players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonny, there was also the name of Honda.
Currently, United has been suffering from injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Byley, FW Antonie, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The "red demon" under the direction of Orre Günner Szarshar was forced to lose 22 victories in the league and slip out of trouble, with challenges to the quality of the line.
It was named after the Australian media as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, "Not strictly speaking Striker, the contract of Honda as a creative side player can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira".
The nine points in the 18-game race at Melbourne Bactley are "successful records", but "The 33-year-old Honda is away from his entertainment to manage Cambodia's national team and needs to be full of attention."
Is it true?
The next year's Tokyo Olympics, due to the veteran who has declared the goal, is also attracting attention.
Five hundred mobile translators were completed.
PokeTalk, a portable translation machine for 500 stores in Hamamatsu, and other stores in Hamamatsu.
On 26 February, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce announced that it had completed 500 stations in Hamamatsu, including stores in Hamamatsu, for free-to-use mobile translation machines "PokeTalk".
It is the first of the nation to concentrate its translation into the same region, and it is noted whether or not it will lead to the improvement of the inbound force.
The hotel offers 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134.
The city's middle district accounts for 60%.
It also began to show the loan to the map app Google Map, and the location of a "foreign-language store" on a smartphone.
It is accessible from sites in the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk to the 74 languages was started in April by nine groups in the city under the declaration of "Japan's First Inbound Support City of Hamamatsu".
The Chamber purchased 500 units, and leased them to a medium-sized business site that met conditions such as hospitality certification and cashless payment.
He said, "I want to connect with foreign customers in the midst of a severe operating environment."
Isn't it necessary to give up?
Today Caddy's best shot.
The 1W shot is not always a tiup.
There is also a so-called "right-dora" technique that he wants to get a ball on the ground when he wants to get a distance in the second round of the lap.
The recent 1W has a large head volume and has a risk of ball scattering, but there are also frequent practitioners on the ground.
Ikemura, who is waiting for his first victory.
At the age of 24, he was 166 cm tall and was 7th (average 304.02yd).
While he was good at Longshot, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In the spring, "I thought I would try to do a direct drum because I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W).
From the training round, he dropped the ball on the lawn of the area, and he was able to cut the ball to 1W.
In cases where the Big Carey needs to be used, the two sides use the direct-dora in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the line is down".
In a ballistic measuring instrument, he recorded 270yd to 280yd.
"That's why I don't have 3W; Caddy is more secure than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood was the only one W in the Caddy bag.
The second longest club is the loft 17th UT.
The process, which is surprised by the tour mates, is also happy to hear the lament from the eyes of the gallery.
Cotz is "to move the club to level."
"If you hit the downbro, you don't fly straight at the upper right, you're going to the right with a cut orbit, and you're doing a direct-dora to correct the 1W shot at the time of Tipup, and the attack angle (the club's entry angle) is also moderate in this practice."
The ball is not captured, and the risk of the slice is "so the left side can be revoked (not turn left).
It's a professional game that I'm going to say ...

Greta Tounbeli, "Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?"
Sweden's environmental activist Gregta Tounberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech has been noted, there has been an insult to Greta.
"Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?"
Political commentators said in American television that Greta was "psychologically ill: it is used by parents and international leftovers", and the television station used it apologized.
In Japan, there is a lot of news about Greta's saying, "It's better to go to school", and that Greta's remarks are not.
On 26 September, Greta posted on his Twitter, saying, "Why are the adults laughing and threatening the teens and children?"
"As long as you can think of lies and conspiracy theories."
Greta said, "See, and also began: As I was concerned, those who disliked me are still active, I look, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm different from people, and I'm going to catch up with them."
Most people did not want to confront the climate or environmental crises, but they pointed out that they seemed to be talking about them.
I can't understand why most people use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
It would be better at that time.
I think they are threatening us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
Changes have been made.
Even if people like the change, they don't like it.
Let's meet on the road on Friday!
On the last Friday of the week, on 20 December, there were strikes on climate change around the world, including New York.
Greta also called for Friday 27.

The show council: Akita Television (Ama's Newspaper) – Yahoo!
The 432th National Broadcasting Council of Akita Television (Mr. Ebatake Kiyohiko) was held, and on 16 August, the broadcast of the film was discussed as "The Pro-Speaker of Editors and cooks!"

A member commented: "The simple concept and theme is clear to the end" "I was seen by interest in the end, such as curry bread, and tempo", while there were opinions such as "I was able to see from a different point of view from a different gourmet site", "The long reproducible drama" "One point of professional curry making was desired."

The Japan-South Korea Sanya Tour co-sponsored "Sinhandhenhe Open" took place 22 days, with the final round at the Year's Best Cheongna Golf Club (7238 yards per 71) in South Korea, and Hoshino Rikuya finished the competition at 1 Eagle, 2 Bardi, 1 Boggy's "68", and the top nine-ranking Japanese under 5th place.
They come to Japan.
Garcia's Weddershot.
I thought that it would be possible to move in the second half, but because Pater was unable to do so, it was regrettable.
Did you see the 6th Eagle, 7th Bardi?
After hitting the boggy on the 4th, the remaining five were left, so if they were willing to return, the chip-in Eagle was on the 6th.
On No. 7, Bardi was able to gain the chance, but he regrets that he did not reach it later.
Is it right now?
Because of the recent lack of good (shot) tone, it was good that Fairway could be well-kept in a narrow course.
Because Laff was also the first and opposite of the rose, and the distance was changed, it was not much (experienced) so it was quite studied.
What is the difference between the usual competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera.
I didn't like it at all, but I'm pretty good at the gallery.
It was not much different from the other, but it was a contest with only a few Japanese players, so I decided to play the game with the feeling that it was "not lost to overseas players".
I'm going to follow the next round, but I don't want to win more than one, so I'm going to win another, and there's also a ZOZO championship near it, so I'm going to be able to get the qualification at that competition.
What is the way to prevent dementia and keep it "getting"?
Interviews, statements/Wabe.
A major pharmaceutical company and university hospital challenge the R&D and suffers from dementia.
However, the relationship between dementia and living habits has been elucidated, and it has been known that it may be extremely mild or forgotten.
Gyeonggi University Hospital Professor Shunsuke Ohtsuki of the Brain School Center.
There is no dementia.
It is expected to prevent dementia or treat it, but what is now?
From mildness to severeness, there may be a difference in degree, and if everyone is older, it may be dementia.
However, new dementia drugs are still considered to take place for more than 20 years.
The commonly used medicine in Japan, called Donepezil, is already out of insurance coverage in some foreign countries, and is not expected to be effective.
On the other hand, the death of infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and the death of cancer has also been declining due to persistent progress in treatment such as anticancer drugs, and people can live longer.
This has led to an increase in dementia patients.
It is not only possible for individuals and families to solve it, but it is necessary to create an environment where people can live safely in the area as a whole.
How to keep it "getting"?
Is there a person who is more likely to be diagnosed with dementia?
Even if it is unavoidable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible, and to keep them "getting".
Dementation is considered to be one of the lifestyle diseases, and tends to be easy.
The people of Metabo tend to be dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
It also affects the existence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are areas where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food available for food tickets is a frozen hamburger, pizza and chicken.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people who live in environments where food is not available.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life biased to lipids and sugars.
Eventually, it is poverty, but obese, and the only thing to do is to see television, and the body becomes unfree.
A similar situation may be in Japan.
Other people who do not think about things or do not work tend to be dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day and think about things.
