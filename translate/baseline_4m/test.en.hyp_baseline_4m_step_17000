There is a number of accidents (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!
Road traffic is a violation of road traffic laws.
There is a growing number of reports of accidents, such as pedal misstepping, but it is a big mistake to think of it as a problem for older drivers.
In recent years, the number of pedal-attacks (the 2015 police report) has been higher than 1032, with more than 24 years old.
It is not uncommon for young adults to see the same thing.
Do you want to take your feet?
Is it safe?
There is no mention of gender or cause of this data, but unlike older people, who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, younger generations may also have a mischievous or misstep due to other factors such as music or conversations.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, breads, sandals, and mulls, as well as a variety of shoes that day.
There are some people who know they are not suitable for driving, but do not think that there is a possibility that they can lead to danger.
However, the operation of high heels and sandals is usually related to road traffic.
One of these was the "safety operation" section of the 70th section of the "safety operation" to ensure the handling of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, and to "do not drive to cause accidents to harm people".
The other is Article 71, which states that the driver must comply with the requirements set by the Council of Public Safety, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, which states that there is a "slipper, sniping, high-heeled, and other driving, wearing clothes that prevent the operation, or wearing them in a way that prevents the operation.
It is similar to the fact that it is considered a violation of the operating system in "competent footwear" until it is not specified as High Heil.
Why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?
It is clear to think about the basics of pedal operation.
In order to ensure safety, the foot or foot is fixed to the floor, placing the feet vertically on the brake pedal, and tilting the feet to the right as a point of the foot when it crosses the accelerator pedal.
In this case, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the area is small enough to land on the floor, and always gravules and breech, and the height of the heel has an angle to the feet, so the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is smaller and it is difficult to adjust finely.
This may lead to danger.
Also, most cars have a carpet, but this material is easy to pull a high heel, and when a heel pulls a pedal, such as a sudden brake, the heel pulls the pedal, and the heel pulls the heel, and the high heel is cut off and cannot cross the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is also a case where a heel pulls back from the pedal and the axel pedal is gone.

Cantapon is not able to enter the final in the top-level competition, but in the second season he is able to reach the top level.
At the age of twenty (21 on 18) when Larry was able to compete with the top players, it is likely that he would be able to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Planys B. was also a step forward in India, where the singles had a favorite.
As Samil Barama, Plane H.S., and Srikas Kidambi, who has been delayed by Kega, are now driven up, attention must be taken to India after the mid-season.
The price of a mobile phone was reduced by a fair competition: the newspapers in North Korea and the newspapers in North America.
A new plan for mobile phone companies was introduced in October following the enactment of the Telecommunications Act.
However, it remained relatively high.
In the summer of 2010, he said, "There was room for a reduction of about 40%", and despite the high expectations of a reduction in prices, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor in the presence of three major companies.
For consumers, it is desirable to make a system of affordable prices available.
I'd like to make a phone call.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on terminal and communications.
Instead of selling the terminal, it was decided that it would be more expensive.
The company and the company announced plans for a maximum of half of the terminal.
However, both companies use SIM locks for 100 days.
NTT docomo has a maximum of one-third of the number of terminal users for only one of its own line contractors.
The three companies will continue to maintain their "intermediate" status.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated that it would require immediate cancellation.
The company also needs to respond quickly.
The delaying of the sky was due to the lack of infrastructure and other infrastructure.
It was expected to be a low-priced explosive, so it was worn out.
I think there's a sweet sight.
It is not clear when the start or price of a full-time service is being started.
As a social infrastructure company, it is necessary to work with responsibility.
This was followed by a report by the Secretary of State.
He complained about the new cost of the three companies: "I don't think it's going to start competition.
However, it is not clear that the "decision" would not encourage a healthy competition.
The company should compete in the customer's top level before being exposed to government.
The system is very complex and not easy to compare.
The consumer agency called attention to the case that the consumer's burden was higher than the half of the consumer's burden, even though the terminal had advertised such as "the maximum half of the money".
It is necessary to make a clear and easy explanation to avoid misunderstanding.
It was reduced to £5 million in cash and cash card for 3 gold in triple.
Three credit cards in the triple-county region were announced on 26 October that they had decided to reduce the amount of cash cards to prevent special fraud.
In the past three years, the bank has a cash card for all credit cards in North Ise Ueno, northern Ise Ueno, and northern Kiō, with a maximum of 500,000 yen for depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain cash transaction at ATM.
On 1 October, the Northern Bank of Japan and the North Ise Ueno Trust were lowered from 1 November.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and card numbers are cleared, such as financial institutions and police, and ATMs are issued, and those involved in the bank have stated that they want to protect their valuable deposits in the manner possible.
It is believed to be the only way to get a chance to go to the room.
The Japanese Sumo Society announced on 27 October that after the death of the Izumi family, it was announced that it had approved the transfer of the three-man crew of the Yokotsuru and the Izumi room to one of them.
The room is similar to the room.
He is the son of a teacher and a brother of his brother.
He died suddenly on 16 October, and the Crasssus and the others were at the same time as the mirrored room, where further treatment was discussed.
At the same time, there are 12 men in the cabin, including 10 mountain mountaines from the same Mongols as the Crane.
"W Rugby World Cup" - Yahoo! News!
U.S. Flacquill is a former English representative who calls him "Tacckle".
The final appearance of the United States in 20 countries was 7–45 in England.
It is a black-and-white star, but later the fluff play, portrayed by Frég Quill, is called a ripple.
It is in the form of a shoulder tackle.
He also published the actual scene in foreign media, and the former English player complained that it was "a insulting, poor play" and not a tackle.
"It's an insulting and bad play!"
In the event of a breakout, both players are in chaos... the real moment of the American national character Quill's performance, the face-to-face danger tackle.
The battle was over a line.
It is a 29-minute mark.
The English commander, Farrell, was able to catch a pass on his side.
He went to Tackle, where he was Quill.
He had a body, not from the bottom of his waist, and had a body on his knees.
As a result, the head and head are in contact with the head.
Farrell was blown up and fell.
It was a protest that English players would throw Quill into the play without any justification.
Both players gathered together and became air-to-air.
As a result of TMO, Quill is forced to leave the Red Card.
Bates left the pitch in a bad face, but some of the crowd asked for a fair play.
Rugby player New Zealand's local media "staff" featured a headline in Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players dropped out of play and English won.
"Kill had a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and turned out to be a retreat", he said, "It was almost a struggle between the two players."
In the article, he introduced a comment by former English athlete Hugo Moña of Commentor.
He said, "It's not an insult, but it's not a tackle."
The United States, which lacked a match, managed to escape the loss of the game in the 81st minute.
However, Quill's play left him behind.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced its first public hospital name on September 26, 1455, and 424 of public hospitals, such as Sun Red and Sun Red.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health examined the public and public hospital treatment of 14 public hospitals, and four facilities were located at the Young High Beach Hospital in the town of Oda Hospital in front of the city's National Hospital Organization, the State Hospital of the city.
"The Four Hospitals for Reorganization".
In order to reduce the medical costs of growing up in the aging population, he decided to reorganize and consolidate the hospital in competing areas.
In October, he asked for a full-scale study of reorganisation and integration of the hospital, which he hoped would conclude by September.
There is no forced force, but there is a threat to local chiefs and residents due to the lack of close hospital.
The meeting was held the same day.
The hospital had a relatively low number of beds per 29 and 1% of the total hospital.
Apart from the prefecture, the county had a high percentage of Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43–30%).
The number of people in the country was 54, and the only one in Okinawa was zero.
The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Labor, based on data from 2017 and 2017 in public and public hospitals, surveyed 1455 hospitals for the "high acute phase" for severe patients, and the "acute period" for general surgery.
In addition to nine medical studies, such as cancer and emergency medical care, a competing hospital analyzed the location within 20 minutes of a car and determined the need to publish a hospital.
The hospital will be closed and some medical services will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical costs increased in the 25 years of age, when all of the mass-marketers were 75 years old.
The Ministry of Health, Trade and Industry aims to reduce the number of hospital beds in 1246,000 beds (18) across the country to 1191,000 beds.
Currently, there are a number of "high-acute" and "acute" beds for nurses, and there is a lack of high-level rehabilitation for the elderly.
In addition to reducing the number of beds, it is necessary to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and consolidate the hospital, a "regional medical concept" was proposed by the prefecture for 25 years, including the number of beds required by the prefecture.
It is divided into 339 regions, with municipalities and medical practitioners discussing it, but many of the local residents and chiefs maintain a cautious stance and debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Labor has stated that it is intended to increase the effectiveness of the debate.

The procession took place from Vancouver City Hall to Cambybridge and to downtown libraries.
Prior to the city hall, people with plastic cards began gathering for hours before the start, and at the start of the day at 13 o'clock in the city hall, the number of people was enough to fill the city's several blocks.
More than 100,000 people participated in the event.
In the middle of the road, the police also collaborated on road regulation and watched it for a few hours before all people walked.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City, many events have been held in Vancouver that consider global warming since the previous weekend.

In the 9th district, the Ministry of Agriculture (GAR) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issued an amendment to the Anti-Defamation Guidelines which allows for the prevention of unrecognized hogs in the present state to prevent the spread of the "bird" epidemic.
It is a policy to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been found to be infected with pigs and wild bounties.
Transfers such as live pigs and fertilized eggs are restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and products outside the region is permitted.
After public comments (such as public opinion) and early in October, the process was completed.
The use of vaccines and the granting of extraditions, such as meat, can cause the export of pork to be unrecognized by international organizations.
Since the end of September, Japan's status was temporarily suspended.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture established a "vaccine recommending area" based on expert opinion regarding areas where the risk of infection from wild bousci to pigs is high.
The target prefectures create a "vaccine program" that combines the range, time, number, and direction of vaccination, and allow the state to use it in the governor's judgment.
The other seven prefectures listed as the recommended area are Saitama, Toyama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, and Mie.
The area has been re-determined when the guidelines have been amended.
Transfers such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and exclamation are restricted to the region.
For meat and processed products, it does not take into account the cost of distribution and the impact of farmers, and effectively allows the distribution of meat outside the region.
In order to prevent the spread of the virus, the treatment of food waste is strictly prohibited.
It also protects the safety of pigs and prevents damage.
The amendments were made to the guidelines at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Epidemitic Affairs on the same day.
In the future, there is a public opinion meeting and a public comment on 7 October to implement a new anti-terrorism policy.
It's an open-air approach to Manu!

In the last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and the former Japanese national team, MF Honda Keiyu, was out of action.
Isn't it really a game?
The truth of the heavens is revealed.
At midnight on the 27th of the day, Honda renewed his Twitter offer, stating that "We don't need money, but we need to play with a great team and a great teammate."
The Manchester United was the name of the Manchester United.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the Premier League club?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, released on 24 October.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs", which Manchester United might have caught in the threat of injury, five players were picked up.
Among players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonney, the name was Honda.
In the United, injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Byley, FW Anthony Malsch, and FW Marcus Rushford are in emergency situations.
The "Red Devil" under the direction of Ole Gonner Slushar, was forced to slip 2–2–2 in the league, causing the line's quality problems.
It was here that the state media named him a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, it is analyzed that the Honda contract as a creative side player, rather than a striker, can bury a hole buried by Andreas Pereira.
Nine goals in the 18-game Melbourne Victory game are hard records, but "The 33-year-old Honda has to leave his entertainment to manage the Kampuchean national team and have full attention."
What's going to happen to him?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move for the next year's Tokyo Olympics to be a veteran who has publicly stated their goals.

Greta Tumbari replied, "Why are the kids laughing and threatening?"
The Swedish environmental activist, Greta Tungberg, spoke at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September.
While the speech has been noted, there has been an insult to Mr. Greta.
"Why do people laugh and threaten children?"
Political commentators complained about Gleta on an American television show, saying that she was "imally ill", and that she was used for her parents and international left.
On the internet in Japan, there is a lot of news about Mr. Greta's "useful" and "good to go to school".
On September 26, Greta posted to his Twitter account, "Why did the people laugh and use time to threaten teenage youth and children?"
"I think that's what we can think about as much as possible."
Greta began to post, "Look, and also began, as the disgusted people are still active: my clothes, my attitudes, and my attitudes, and I've got rid of what I'm talking about."
He pointed out that the people did not want to deal with the climate or environmental crisis, and that the story seemed to be a point of debate.
I can't understand why people use time to laugh and threaten teenage youth and children.
It would be better to do that.
I'm sure they're being threatened.
But don't spend your time trying to pay them more attention.
The world begins to awaken.
There are changes.
I don't like it, but I don't like it.
