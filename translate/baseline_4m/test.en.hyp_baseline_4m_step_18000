It is thought to be dangerous.
Most cars have floor carpets, but this material can be easily removed from the heel, and when the heel is pulled by the pedal, such as the brake, the heel is removed from the heel, and the heel is unable to cross the pedal.
In addition, he is said to have pulled the pedal back to the back of the pedal, and that the Axel pedal was not returned.
