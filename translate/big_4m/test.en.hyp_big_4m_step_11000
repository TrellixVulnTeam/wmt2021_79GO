It is dangerous to drive in High Heil!
Youth pedal wrong accident (Automesis Web) - Yahoo!
Road traffic laws generally act against violations of the act.
Although the number of reports of accidents caused by malfunctioning, such as pedal error, I think it's a big mistake.
In the past, the number of accidents occurred (2015 police agency data) has more than 24 years of age, and more than 1080 cases have passed over 75 years.
It's not be a lot of older people, but it's important to call young people alike.
Do you take the original oshare?
Do you take safety?
There is no reference to gender ratios or causes of this data, but it is often assumed that the elderly may come from the body, such as driving skills and reflection nerves, may be mistaken for music or conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by high heels, breads, sandals, sandals, and mulls and day clothes, and many people drive.
Some people know that they don't fit to drive, but they're not be careful to change their clothes, but they don't think they can lead to danger.
However, the driving in High Heels and Sandald generally touch road traffic laws.
One thing is to ensure that the handle, brake or other operation is to ensure that the driver should not harm the person who is causing the accident," said Article 70.
And another driver should comply with each city's public safety committee should comply with the provisions of the Article 71 of the Public Safety Committee, for example, the Road Traffic Act of Miyazaki Prefecture shall not interfere with the operation of the vehicle.
Both prefectures and the prefectures should not be defined as high Heels, as well as the purpose of driving in the clothing that could prevent driving operations.
At this point, why is the driving in high heels dangerous?
It is clear if you think about the basics on pedal safety operation.
For safety pedal operation, the first leg is fixed to the floor, and the brake pedal will be vertical to the brake pedal, so you can tilt it to the right point.
At this point, the behavior of the car is important to ensure that or not be fixed properly.
However, the area where the high heels are small, always glgra and brell, and the distance of the pedal is small, and the thin adjustment of the small area is not always small enough.
This could lead to danger.
In most cars, the car floor has a carpet on the floor, but this material is easy to pull high heels, and can not pull the pedal when the hyald brake is turned off, the hyaldration is turned off, and the hyaldration is turned off.
In addition, when the pedal is turned back to the back side of the pedal, the accelerator pedal is gone back, there is also a case.

It is a view to take a look at it, and it is noticed that it is a correlation between the works "my beauty" and fear.
[Image] Are you attractive because there are shadows?
I don't have a picture of my work (five)
In the first chapter of the "Omi Girls Collection", there was a statement that had the beauty of the story and the development of them in extreme contrast, but the beautiful face could be changed from the contrast of the face of the face of the repulsion.
There are many keywords to appear in the work, but the snakes are different from those who have seen it as "sunlike creatures" by the people, and the people feel beautiful and receive a lot of people.
If you like reptiles in the world, you don't really like it.
At this point, the feeling of the person who sees "my" and "magic evil" may be the creature behind the table.
This creature is also worshiped as a more spiritual power, and the house where the "white snake" has lived is good.
The work of the snakes was described in 1965, "My mom is in the series" and "the girl" still there.
In most cases, it is the price of a woman who has a shadow.
What should I say, "cooling" type?" ... I feel like a beautiful girl who appears in the picture of the work.
In the past, the role of the weekly boy Sun Day, which was serially serialized in 1969, is the representative of the work of the series, but it is a beautiful girl character that is the representative of the work of the series.

In the first half of the Bad Olympic Games, the world's king Taoda wise, high-performance Zhou Tianchi, lead a step forward!
< Men's singles < Bad x Spirit!
The 6 winners of the biggest event in Badminton, the 25th World Championships (Switzerland Basel) held in August, will be held in China, starting from September 17 to 1000.
At this point, the men's singles will be looking forward to the mid-season (September to December) while the Olympic race began from May to August.
The Badminton Olympic Race began in May, and the top players at the World Championships after the World Championship (Super 500) were absorbed.
In the first half of the game, he played the 2nd prize in the four competitions, and two people of the Taiwan Zhou Tenchen.
Taota won the World Championships, the world rankings, and the highest point of world ranking points to be connected to Indonesia's OP (S1000).
The peacha also has the JapanOP (S750) installed on it.
The tournament will be held from May to May (May/China), Indonesia (July 16) and Indonesia (July 16).
There are few other top players compared to other top players, but it's probably a schedule to reduce burden on their body.
In August, the World Championship was just one of the World Championships, but not be much more fatigue than the war.
After September, we need a good result in the middle of the competition.
Taiwan Ace is very strong fighting.
The young people in Thailand also attention!
He also won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand (S500) at the top of the tournament.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the prize.
At first, players don't fight hard and hard.
There is no big problem in playing the game after the tournament.
At this point, the schedule adjustment of the tournament will be easier to meet by winning high points in the first half.
It was the impression that Zhou Tianten had been unexplored until last year, but this year, the stability of the play was improved.
For the world ranking 1st in the peachda, it's more than ever-increasing.
In the first half of this two players left the result, with the young Ace Cantaphon and the Cypranny B in India.
And it is a 3 player of the Under Antonen, who is struggling with the forces of the European Union.
Cantaphony won't go to the top of the tournament, and now it's best to enter the second season.
There are still a rough side, but 20 years old (21-year-old) can be rallying against top players and other players (21 years old).
In addition, Cypraneys B. went through a step in India with a good player.
Sumbarrasuma, Prano H.S., and take a rest in Kega, Sensica Kimbi also needs attention to India after the middle war.
The new mobile fee is a fair competition: How about Hokkaido newspapers?
The new mobile phone company's new price plan was launched after the amendments to the telecommunications business in October.
But it was mostly high.
In spite of the expectations of the price, the price didn't rise even though the director said that it had a lower room than last summer.
The full entry of Leshan is forwarded, and the three major states continue to be a big factor.
For consumer fair competition, it is desirable to be a simple price system.
I want to ask for the help of mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits the set of terminals and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminals, communication fees were set to be high.
SoftBank and KDDI announced the plan to make up the terminal up to half.
However, for 100 days, the SIM lock can be used by other companies.
NTTdocom makes up the maximum of 3 minutes of the device for just a contract with its own line.
The three companies also continue to continue to move around to prevent transferring to other companies.
Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs expressed the policy to immediately withdraw the file.
The company side should be linked quickly.
The ease of communication networks such as base stations was not been entirely installed.
The only thing that was expected to be the explosives of the competition was that the shoulder was wearing.
I think there was a sweetness of expectations.
The start of the full service and the price did not clear.
We want to work with the company as a social infrastructure company.
At this point, the statement of the Secretary General of the Department of the Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan was made.
Mr. Kang said, "I don't think that the competition will start, and I don't think it's a good thing."
At this point, the "downloading" market is not considered to be a healthy competition.
The company should expand the customer's competitive competition before the government exits.
The fee system for each company is very complicated and easy to compare.
The device calls consumer agencies to be careful as consumers have a half-priced increase in consumer burdens, such as "up to half."
The company itself should be able to make a clear and easy description of the customer's misunderstanding.

Today's best shot.
1W shots are not always up and down.
When you want to get a distance from the second of the Par5, you want to have a ball in the ground, so called "directed dr".
The recent oneW has a large head volume, and the ball is scattered, but there are many players who often practice it on the ground.
The first victory of the tour is Ikebukuro Village.
At the age of 24 years, while the height of 166 cm and small, dry bingdy stance is now 7th ( average 304.02 yd).
Long shots were good, while one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwood.
I thought that it was impossible to shoot the spoon (3W) before spring, so I thought to try straight dr.
There is also a ball drop on the grass of the practice round to the area, and you can turn around 1W.
The case requires a large calibre, but both sides are effective in a narrow hall.
"It can be used in a hall where the line is turned down."
The test road measurement equipment recorded a 270 yd-280yd.
"If you don't have 3W, you can be more intuitive than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W.
The second longest club is Roft 17.
It is also fun to hear that the battle law that surprises the tour mates is the feeling of leaking from the gallery.
What is the club going to level ( horizontal)?
"I went straight to the right of the cut orbit, but I didn't go straight to the right, and I was able to turn the swing of the 1W shots (at the time) to straight the swing.
If the ball is not caught, the risk of slices is " so the left side will be removed (not turn left).
It's a professional technique, but I think it's a thing.

How to prevent the suffering of dementia and forget what to do?
Interviews / Shoguns (like the sun)
The major pharmaceuticals and universities challenge the research and development of research and development.
However, we know that the relationship between dementia and living habits could be understood, and that it could be able to forget very light, very light.
Near the University Hospital I heard a talk to Prof. Daisuke Ojii, a brain graduate.
There is no dementia.
- Is it waiting for the prevention of dementia or treatment, but what is the current situation?
The difference between the Otsuki and the severity of the severity of the disease may be the age of all people and become dementia.
However, the drug of new dementia is still considered to be developed for more than 20 years.
The drug, commonly used in Japan, can be used in some countries already outside of the insurance adaptation and can not be expected.
On the other hand, the deaths of infectious diseases and accidents reduced, and cancer deaths could be reduced due to the rapid progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, the fact that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
You should not be able to solve the problem with your own or family, not be able to solve the problem.
How to do this?
- Is it easy to be a person who is suffering from dementia?
If you don't be a dementia, you may be able to reduce symptoms as much as possible, "no forget to forget."
The dementia is considered as one of life habits, and tends to be a simple person.
First, the metabo people are prone to dementia.
The dementia is captured as one of the habits of life.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high blood disease.
It also affects the absence of economic power.
For example, there are areas where food tickets are distributed to poor food in the United States, but food tickets can be saved in the food ticket is Hamburg and pizza and chicken.
Gas can not be used for electricity, and people living in a environment where food cannot be eaten.
At this point, vegetables and vegetables become less protein-like diets, and they have become polarized in lipids and sugar quality.
At this point, while poverty becomes obesity, only watching TV, the body becomes unfree.
A similar situation may be Japan.
Other, things don't think about things, people are prone to dementia.
In this sense, to prevent dementia, you need to think about things that don't do metabolites, and read books around the day.
