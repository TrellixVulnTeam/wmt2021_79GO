Driving in high heels is dangerous!
There are many accidents involving young people's pedals (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
A violation of road traffic laws
The number of reported accidents due to false operation such as pedal error is increasing, but it's a big mistake that I think it's only a problem with older drivers.
In the past, the number of cases of error-related accidents (2015 police agency data), the number of cases in which the number of years has increased to 1080, exceeding 75 years old and over 1032.
The mistake is not always the elderly, but it is important to call attention to the younger generation.
Do you take the original oshare?
Take safety?
This data does not contain gender ratios and causes, but the elderly who are often thought to get out of physical weakness such as driving skills and reflection nerves, and young people may be aware of other things such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing a high heels, breads, sandals, mulls, and the clothes of the day and drive them as well.
Some people say it's cumbersome to change the wear while you know that driving is not suitable, but there are many people who are driving unsatisfactory.
However, driving in high heels and sandals usually touches the road traffic laws.
One thing is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations operate properly, "Do not drive to harm the person who has caused the accident" and "Prohibition of Safety Driving obligations".
Another thing is that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee of each prefecture, and in Article 71 of the "Provision of the Public Safety Commission" (e.g., the traffic laws of Miyazaki Prefecture) and the traffic laws of Miyazaki Prefecture, the Slipper, Slipper, Heels, and other operations that hinder the operation of high heels or other.
Both prefectures and prefectures are subject to violations of the driving of the wear that could hinder driving operations until they do not specify high heels.
So, why is the driving in high heels dangerous?
It's obvious if you think about the basics on pedaling safely.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, the first leg is fixed on the floor and put the feet vertically against the brake pedal and tilt the feet to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to firmly fix the vehicle's behavior, whether or not.
However, in the high heels, the area where the floor is grounded is small and the area is always glamorous and brethren, and the area of the foot that surrounds the entire foot at the height of the heels is also small.
This could lead to danger.
Most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull high heels, and when the heels are pulled into the back of the pedals, the heels can't be pulled out.
In addition, there are cases where he pulls the pedal to the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is gone.

New rates for mobile phones In a fair competition: Hokkaido Newspaper
In October, a new fee plan for the mobile phone company was introduced to the Telecommunications Business Act.
However, the high stopped.
Despite the high expectations of the decline in the value, the price competition did not happen last summer.
This is a major factor in the fact that the full-scale entry of Leshan has continued to be forwarded.
It is desirable for consumers to be a cost-effective system for fair competition.
I would like to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits the set discount of terminal and communications fees.
Instead of selling the terminal, communication fees were set to be high.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the terminal up to half the amount.
However, a 100-day network of companies can't use the same line as other companies.
NTT DoCoMo will be one of the largest and third-party subscribers in the company line.
The three companies will continue to move around to other companies to prevent switching to other companies.
Regarding SIM rock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy to ensure immediate termination.
The corporate side also needs to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was not due to the development of communication networks such as the base station.
It was only expected that it would be a low-value explosive.
Was there any sweetness of the outlook?
The start of a full-scale service and fees have not been revealed.
As a corporate responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
The revision of the price was the opportunity for Mr. Kan.
Mr. Suga noted that he was not thinking about the new fees of three companies, "I'm going to start the competition.
However, the lower price of the government does not seem to promote the market and healthy competition.
The corporate side should expand the customer's competition before being addressed by the government.
The pricing system for each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
A consumer agency called for attention as the device has a half-priced case for advertising such as "up to half-priced".
Companies themselves have to strive to make a simple and easy explanation to make the user misunderstandings.

The ball is not caught and the risk of the slice is accompanied by a risk of "So the left side can be undone".
It's a professional technique that makes me think...

It was good that the fairway was able to play firmly in a narrow course because it was not good (shots).
The roughness and reverse eyes were a course that changed the distance, so I had not experienced much.

How to prevent dementia from becoming a "get" degree?
Interviews, Bunka Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies, universities, and hospitals challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated, and it seems to have been possible to keep up with extreme mildness and forgottenness.
Kinki University Hospital I was asked to speak to Professor Ohtsuki.
There is no dementia.
Is there a hope for dementia prevention, or treatment?
The difference from Otsuki's mildness to severeness is that everyone can become dementia after age.
However, the drug development of new dementia is still thought to be over 20 years.
Some countries in Japan have already become insurance adaptors in some countries and cannot expect remarkable completion.
On the other hand, cancer deaths have decreased due to infections and accidents, and cancer deaths have been declining dramatically.
This is why the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not only possible to resolve yourself and family alone, but we need to create a environment that can live comfortably in the community.
How to keep things forgotten about
Is there a person who is easy to get dementia, a difficult person?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, it is possible to reduce symptoms as much as possible.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be easy.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
The dementia is recognized as one of the lifestyle diseases.
