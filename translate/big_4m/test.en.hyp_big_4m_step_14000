Driving at high heels is dangerous.
There are many accidents that make the mistake of the young pedals – Yahoo!
A violation of road traffic laws and regulations.
Although the number of reports of accidents due to malfunctioning of the pedal is increasing, it is a big mistake that I think it is only a problem of old drivers.
In the number of accidents in the wake of the accident (2015 police agency data), more than 24 years of age, the results of more than 1032 cases over 75 years.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation.
Do you take the original oshare?
Take safety?
This data does not contain gender ratios and causes, but the differences between the elderly and the elderly who are often considered to be due to physical degradation such as driving skills and reflex nerves, etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, breadps, sandals, mulls and the clothes of the day.
Some people know that they are not suitable for driving, but there are many people who have been driving without worrying about the possibility of becoming dangerous.
However, driving in the Heal and Sandal usually touches on road traffic laws.
One thing is to ensure that the steering wheel, brake and other operations operate properly, and the 70th article "Do not allow the operation to be dangerous to the person who has caused the accident."
Another thing is that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture, for example, in Article 71 of the "Protection of the Public Security Committee" which stipulates that the driver must comply with the provisions of Article 12 of the Ordinance on Road Traffic in Miyazaki Prefecture, the vehicle shall not be carried out in a manner that interferes with the operation of the Heal and other operations.
Both the prefectures and the prefectures are similar to the fact that driving in the "wear that can interfere with driving operations" is considered a violation.
Why is the driving in the Healus dangerous?
It is obvious if you think of the basics on pedaling safely.
For the safety pedal operation, the first step is fixed on the floor and the foot is perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, you can tilt your feet as a base point.
At this time, it is important to keep firmly fixed, regardless of the behavior of the car, or so on.
However, in the high heels, the area surrounding the floor is small, and it is always difficult to adjust finely because it has a wide angle of angle at the height of the heels.
This is thought to lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material can be easily pulled out of high heels and the heels are not attached to the pedal when the brake is pulled.
In addition, there is a case where the heel pulls the pedal back to the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is not returned.

Listen to the president who adopted it.
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 Delivery
It is now a popular YouTuber, especially young people.
There are no cases where companies use their products for advertising now, but there are companies that have begun to adopt the "To YouTuber" as their employees.
Direct marketing mix (hereinafter referred to as "DmMiX"), which is the main business of the company's CRM.
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Kobayashi, Chief Executive Officer of DmMX, who has actually been appointed by YouTuber, also serves as the first representative of the subsidiary company and staff.
I want to support young people who are working hard with YouTuber.
What is the mechanism? – What is the "To YouTuber adoption"?
Kobayashi Yuki (hereinafter, Kobayashi) : Today, the profession of YouTuber has become a long-standing admire of many young people.
The number of young students who want to take the job rankings for the future will continue to increase.
In the past, we have adopted and supported young people who have pursued dreams such as Bandman and Laughter.
In the same way, the young people who are trying to make a dream of becoming a YouTuber are adopting YouTuber.
Is it the image that an individual voluntarily posts a video?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, most YouTuber has a reality that doesn't seem to be profitable.
There are few creators who are working on video production and post-production, and creators who do not recognize the existence of YouTuber on their family.
In this effort, the creators employed will provide the environment for pay and content creation.
At first, I believe that we will support our activities by supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber, which is an unstable position.

(Nakamura Yasunari)
[The first half of the Bambad Olympics] The world's kings, Momoda Kendo, and a leading step forward.
Men's singles.
In August, the Japanese national team won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland Basel), the Bigton event held in Badminton, the 25th World Championships (Switzerland, Switzerland) and the Japanese won the first prize in September.
Here, the men's singles will be projected for the first half of the year from May to August, when the Tokyo Olympics race began in next year.
The Badminton Olympic Race, which began in May, was digested by the top players at the end of the World Championships (more than 500 Super 500).
In the first half of the competition, two people will be the winner of the 4th tournament, Momoda Kendo, and the second prize in Taiwan.
Momoda has won the World Championships and the World Championships, where he can win the World rankings directly connected to the Olympic Games.
In addition, Momoda also has a Japanese OP (S750) system.
The competition from May to May is organized by the Sdillman Cup (May/China), Indonesia's OP (July 16 Qiang) and the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Compared to the other top players, the number of players is small, but it is probably a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August it was only one of the world's best competitions, but the fatigue will not be greater than the war.
It is necessary to make a positive result in the mid-tier competition from September.
Taiwan Ace, which is strong in the battle.
It is also noteworthy for young people in Thailand.
He has also won the top tournament of Indonesia's OP and Thailand (S500) and has already won seven competitions.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the prize.
Originally, there is a strong physical player who does not struggle.
Even if the tournament continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the competition, it would also be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming competition.
It was the impression that Zhou Heaven had lost its explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the play has increased.
For Momoda, one of the world's top rankings, it seems to be more and more disappointed.
I left the results in the first half of the game except the two players, but the young Ace Cantaphones in Thailand and the Cy Planeys B in India.
And it is the third player of the unders Antonsen, who is struggling as a European army.
The Cantaphones are not only available to the final round of the top tournament, but now they are in the second half of the season.
Even though there are still some rough aspects, it is said that 20 years old (21 years old on the 18th of the 18th) can have a great chance to leap in the Olympic race.
In addition, Sai Pearneys B. has taken a step in India where a single sprinter can be enjoyed.
Smir Balaima, Prano H.S.S., and S.E.K., who has been delayed by injury, will continue to push up in the future.
New rates of mobile Phone fair competition: How the newspapers of Hokkaido
A new fee plan for the mobile phone company that has been implemented by the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October was issued.
But it was generally high.
Mr. Sugawara said, "There is a room to lower the level of 4 percent in the summer last summer, and despite the high expectations for the reduction of the value, price competition did not occur.
It is a big factor that the real entry of the Kingdom of Heaven is forwarded and the three major companies have continued to exist.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fair competitive system for easy use.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile company.
The amended Act prohibits the set discounts of terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal age, communication fees were set to be high.
SoftBank and KDDI have announced a plan to make the device up to half.
However, in both the two companies, the "SSL lock" that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days is the mechanism for the terminal.
NTT DOCOMO will be the largest and third of the terminal age for only the subscribers of its own lines.
The three companies will continue to "recovery" to prevent transfers to other companies.
Regarding SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications expressed its policy to immediately terminate the SIM lock.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's delay in communication networks, such as the base station, did not proceed as planned.
It was only expected that it would become a explosive agent of the lower price competition, so I was wearing a shoulder.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start times and rates of full-scale services have not been revealed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want to work with responsibility.
The revision of the price was made by Mr. Kanbo.
Mr. Suga said, "I think that the competition will start in the future, and I am not thinking about it at all."
However, the decline in government value does not seem to encourage healthy competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out from the government.
The company's pricing system is very complicated and is not easy to compare.
The consumer agency called attention as a case where the consumer burden would exceed half the amount of money, as the terminal has advertisements such as the maximum amount of money.
Companies themselves have to try to explain polite and easy to understand, so that they don't live their misunderstandings.

⇒The four hospitals for reorganisation are "standard funny"
In order to suppress the medical expenses that are expanding in the age of the population, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate with hospitals in the competitive area.
In October, we also call for a full-scale review of the hospital restructuring and integration, and we hope to conclude by September next year.
There is no force to force, but the local chiefs and residents are expected to repulsion from the anxiety that the familiar hospital will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The target hospital was 291% of the total, and the number of beds was relatively low.
In separate prefectures, Niigata (53 and 7 percent) and Hokkaido (48 and 6 percent) and Miyagi (47 and 5 percent) and Yamaguchi (46.7%) were the proportions of Okayama (43 and 31%).
The number of targets is 54 in Hokkaido, but Okinawa is the only zero.
Based on data from the 2017 data, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigates 1455 hospitals that respond to the "high-acute period" for patients with public and public hospitals, which will respond to the " acute phase" of general surgery.
As a result of 9 clinical trials, such as cancer and emergency medicine, the hospital analyzed the location of the hospital within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need to publish the hospital name.
In the targeted hospital, you will be asked to consider the abolition and some clinics to be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses will increase in 25 years, which will be over 75 years of age and over.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a target to reduce the number of beds in hospitals in 124 thousand beds in the country to 110,000 beds.
Currently, there are a number of beds in the "high acute period" and " acute age" that are expensive for the elderly.
In order to respond to the aging population, it is necessary to increase the number of beds, as well as rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of the hospital, each prefecture formulated a "local medical concept" that defines the number of beds required for 25 years.
In the area of 339 countries, local governments and medical officials are discussing, but many local residents and the chiefs are cautiously maintaining their stance and discussions are difficult.

On 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a revision of the quarantine guidelines to prevent the preventative vaccination of non-identified pigs to prevent the spread of the infection of "Bang" cholera.
The targeted area is determined to select 9 prefectures, such as Gifu, Aichi, which have been confirmed by the infection of pigs and wild bounti.
The movement of the infected pigs and fertilized eggs is limited within the region, but the distribution of sperm and processed products is recognized.
Through public comments to the general public, etc., we aim to complete the procedures in October.
By using the vaccine and acknowledging the distribution of external distributions such as sperm, it is not recognized by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of the September last year, Japan has been in a temporary state of the country's status.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set the "communication recommended area" based on the opinions of experts in the area where the risk of infection from wild boronics to pigs is high.
The prefecture's target prefectures have created a vaccine vaccination program that summarizes the range of vaccinations, the number of heads, and how to proceed.
Other 7 prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, have been recognized as a recommended area for vaccination.
When the regional guidelines have been revised, the situation will be decided again.
The movement of infected pigs, sperms, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excrement is limited in the region as a rule.
The distribution of meat and processed products is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact of farmers.
To prevent the spread of viruses, we will thoroughly process food waste.
It also addresses the safety of the infected pig and also prevents the damage of the wind.
The revised draft of the Guidelines was compiled at the meeting of the open experts on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Terrorist Headquarters.
In the future, the public comments to the prefecture will be carried out until October 7th, and the new anti-corruption guidelines will be implemented.

As far as last season, the Australian A League's Melbourne Victory has left the country's former FF Honda's amazing action.
[Video] Mr. Keita, who was actually in the game.
The truth of heaven reveals.
On the night of the 27th of the Japanese time, the bookstore updated its Twitter on the night of the night, "Please do not need a offer, but you have to play with a great team or great teammates."
The other person who sent the reverse offer was Manchester United, the world's largest gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request for the Premier League's strongest club?
The story was published on the 24th of the Australian version of FOX Sport.
In the article entitled "FW of five persons who could be caught in the midst of the danger of injury, Manchester United has picked up five non-member players who are currently available.
There was also the name of Honda in the players like Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Roche, and Will Fred Boney.
At present, U.S. injuries such as MF Paul Pogba and FDF Luke Show, FW Ann Tony Marri, FW Marcus Rushford and others have continued to be in emergencies.
The "red Devil" led by Ole Gunnar Schalhl, has been challenged by the League's 2 wins and 22 defeats, and has been challenged by the quality of the front.
That was why the media in Australia named it as a new force candidate for Teco.
In the article, the contract of Honda as a creative side player is analysed as a hole filled by Andreas Pelaya.
The 18-game score in Melbourne Victory is "strong and steady record" but the 33-year-old Honda has also pointed out that it is necessary to get away from his entertainment to manage Cambodia's representatives and to get full attention.

Today's best shot shot.
1W shot is not necessarily up and hit.
When you want to get a distance from the second half of the par5, there is a technique called "redirection" that you want to have a ball on the ground.
The recent 1W has a large head volume, so there are players who often practice this on the ground, with the risk that the ball scatters.
The first victory of the tour is the Kuike Village.
The age of 24 in the seventh year is 166 cm tall and small, while the current 7th position (average 304.02 yd) is currently in the dry bindy stance.
One of the challenges was the accuracy of fairwaywood.
In the beginning of the spring, "I don't have a shot of spoon (3W) so I want to try it again."
You may drop the ball over the grass of the area from the practice round to the Potri, or even turn one W into a thorn.
In the case of the Big Carry, the two sides are effective for direct use in narrow holes.
It can be used in the hall where the eye line is down."
In the road measuring instrument, the 270 yd~280 yd is recorded in the carriage.
"I don't have 3W because I don't have 3W, Caddy can be more secure than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only one W in the Caddy bag.
The second longest club is Roft 17.
I am also pleased to hear the news from the tour guide.
It is said that the couts will swing the club to the level.
"Even at the bottom break, I don't fly straight at the top, but I went straight to the right with the cut track (at the time of the Tiup) to correct the swing correction of the 1W shot."
The ball is not caught and the risk of the slices is accompanied by "So the left side can be erased (not bent on the left).
It is a professional skill that makes me think.

Garcia's wedge shot
I thought that it would be possible in the second half of the second half, but it was regrettable because it was not easy to reach.
Is it the winner of the 6th Eagle, 7th Bardy?
Even after I hit Boggy in the fourth place, I had five of them, so when I was feeling back, I had six chips in Eagle.
Even at the 7th, Bardi was able to get the chance, but it was regrettable that it did not stretch in the second half.
What did you get in this tournament?
It was good that the fairway was able to make a solid key even in a narrow course because it was not good.
The roughness and the back of the rafts were also a course that changed the distance from the roses, so I learned a lot because I didn't have much experience.
What is the difference between the regular competitions?
It was also possible to shoot the camera.
I didn't like it at all, but there was a lot of people in the gallery.
There were not many other things that changed, but I was just a few Japanese players in the competition, so I felt that I couldn't win the overseas players.
I'm going to win the second half, but I don't want to win the prize because I don't want to win more than one, so I'd like to win another, and I'd like to go to the top of the ZOZO championship.
What is the way to prevent dementia?
Interview, sentence, and Yoyo Watanabe.
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are challenged by research and development.
However, it seems that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated, and it is possible to keep it extremely mild and forgotten.
Near Kinki University Hospital I spoke to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation?
From mild to severe, there is a difference between the degree and severity of the disease.
However, it is believed that the drug development of new dementia will still take more than 20 years.
The drug used in Japan is already outside of insurance adaptation in some countries outside of Japan, and it cannot be expected to be a remarkable cure.
On the other hand, the death of infection and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have been declining due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anti-cancer drugs.
That is why the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
It is not only possible to resolve it by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment that can live in peace in the whole community.
How to keep in mind about "get things"
What are those who are prone to dementia?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, there is a possibility of keeping the symptoms as low as possible.
Diabetes is considered as one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be a prone person.
First, the Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects economic power.
For example, in the United States, there is a region that distributes food tickets called food tickets to the poor, but food that can be saved is hamburgers and pizzas and chickens.
Gas can not be used for electricity, and people living in an environment where food cannot be served.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased into lipids and carbohydrates.
Eventually, when it comes to poverty, it becomes obese, and when it comes to TV, the body becomes free.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things tend to be prone to dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things that are not metabolized and read books from the day.
