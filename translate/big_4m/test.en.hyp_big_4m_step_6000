The driving is dangerous!

For safety pedals, it is first fixed to the floor, and the foot of the brakes to be vertical to the brake pedals, and the right is to right the right.
At this time, it is important to ensure that even if the behavior of the car is, or that it does not have a pen.
However, in High Heath, a small portion of the area of the floor is sufficiently small, and it is difficult to adjust the size of the feet to the feet of the feet to the edge of the foot.
It is believed to be dangerous.
Most of the car is equipped with a floor carpet, but this material is easy to pull out, and if Heath is not able to push for a slow brake, it is possible that Heath would not be able to push out, and the Heather will be unable to stand out in the middle of the pedal.
In addition, when the pedal is returned, the Heather will turn on the back side of the pedals, and the case of the instrument kicking.
