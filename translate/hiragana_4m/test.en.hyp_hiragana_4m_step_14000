Driving in the high heels is dangerous.
The pedal of young people When you make a mistake, it is a small start - Yahoo!
Road Traffic Act violations.
Although the number of reports of accidents due to pedal errors is increasing, it is a big mistake to think that is a problem only for older drivers.
The number of years-specific pedals and accidents in the 2015 Police Agency data shows that the most common age is up to 1080 people aged 24 and over 1032.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well as the younger generation.
Would you like to take a stylish look?
Do you take safety?
This data does not include gender and cause, but unlike the elderly who are often expected to come from the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, the young age group is likely to take care of other things such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, panps, sandals, mulls, and the day's outfits.
While driving is not suitable, some people say it's troublesome to change, but some people don't think about the potential to lead to danger.
However, the driving in the high heels and sandals is set in the road traffic laws.
The first is to ensure that the handle, the brakes and other operations are manipulated, and the 70th stated that "a violation of safety driving obligations" is defined as "a violation of the obligation to prevent accidents from driving such as harm to people".
Second, in Article 71 of the Act on the Protection Committee, the driver must comply with the matters set forth by the prefectural Public Safety Committee, for example, in the first half of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, the driver said, "It is a part of the vehicle's driving system that prevents the wearer, slippers, and other driving operations."
In each prefecture, the seeds that are considered to be a violation of the operation of a kimono that may interfere with driving operations even today.
Why is driving in the heels dangerous?
It is clear if you think about the basics of pedaling safely.
For a safe pedal operation, the foot or the foot is first fixed on the floor and the brake pedal is perpendicular to the foot, and when the accelerator pedal is pressed, the foot is tilted to the right.
At this point, it is important to firmly fix the car's behavior, regardless of the car's behavior.
However, in the high heels, the area of the cacatoga is small and the area of the foot to be placed on the floor is always gradated and the height of the heels and the angle to the entire foot, so the area of the foot to be installed on the pedal is also smaller and the fine adjustment becomes difficult.
This could lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have a floor carpet, but this material is easy to wear, and when the heels are tight, the pedals are not taken, and the heels can be pulled in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heels pull the pedal back from the pedal and the accelerator pedal is not removed.

Umezu Kazuo's image of a snake that overlaps with the girl's beauty - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common with a mysterious beauty and a shadowy look?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and in August 2019, the Umezu Kazuo Bi girls collection, which focuses on the beautiful girls depicted by Prof. Kazuo Umezu, known as the first-person of the horror manga.
When you look at it, you will be reminded of the relationship between "bis" and " fears" of umezu Kazuo's work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Umezu Kazuo's long-term girl (five pieces)
In the chapter of the "Beautiful Girl Collection" there was a sense that "the beauty of women in the face of horror, shame, and story shocks and unfolds are all right," but the contrast is that the beautiful face changes to the expression of distortion and the resentment of the year ... ...
Although there is a keyword called a snake that appears in Kazuo Umezu, the snake is captured by the viewer as a "spreadful creature" or "beautiful" by people who feel "beautiful".
There are some people who like reptiles in the world, and some people say they don't like them.
In this way, the "birth" and "juvenation" of the viewer may be the "s snake" of living creatures.
In addition, this creature has been planted as a living organism with a higher spiritual power than ancient times.
The work of Umezu, which is based on the theme of the snake, is "Mummy is scary!" in 1965, and "Madara girl" in the series.
The exchange rate is that there is a shadow of becoming a snake woman.
Is it good to say that if you're going to say it's a "cool viewer" type?I think that's the common sense of beauty girls appearing in the work.
In particular, "Orochi" is the main character of the work of Umezu's work since 1969, and it is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of the work of Umezu.

You may also hear issues such as a safe management system.
Even though it is said, "It will change the values of many people," Yuasa said that connecting with society will become a safety net for disasters and other disasters.
It seems to be a hopeful light to be a closed society.

It is now a great popularity for young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to make use of their products for advertising, but there are companies that have begun to adopt a unique system called "Youtuber".
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX), which is the main business of the company's customer relationship management.
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
He was the Representative Director of DmMiX, and this time, he spoke to Mr. Kobayashi, who was also the first representative of the company and staff who was actually using YouTuber.
I would like to support young people who are working with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is the use of YouTuber in the first place?
Kobayashi Shoki : Now, the profession of YouTuber has become a longstanding for many young people.
In the future, elementary school students will enter the top rankings in their career rankings, and young people will continue to increase.
In the past, we have adopted and supported young people who have been chasing dreams like bandman and laughter performers.
In the same way, I adopt young people who follow the dream of becoming a YouTuber and use it to support them.
It's an image that a person voluntarily makes a video post, but why did you think it was a " hiring"?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, most of them have a reality that YouTuber is not profitable as they thought.
There are a number of creators who make video production and post-productions while working as part-time jobs and creators who do not accept the existence of a family member.
This initiative provides the environment for hiring creators to paycheck and create content.
At first, I believe that we will support and support our activities by supporting the benefits of the occupation of YouTuber that will become unstable.

[The first round of the Bado Olympic race] World Champion Momota and the first-ever finish are the first.
Men's singles < Budo × Spin!
The Japan national team won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland, Basel, Switzerland) held in August and participated in the ChinaOP (Tunezhou / Super 1000), which was held from the beginning of September.
Here, we will look forward to the men's singles for the first time from May to August, when the next year's Tokyo Olympics race began.
Badminton's Olympic Games began in May, when the world championship ended, the top players competed for the fourth round, Super 500 or more.
In the first half, Mr. Momota, who won the second prize in the 4th round, would be two people at the end of Taiwan.
Momota won the world championship, the highest point in Indonesia's OP (S1000) and the world ranking point that is directly connected to the race.
Momota also made JapanOP (S750).
In May, the competition was held in Sdillman High School (May / China), Indonesia OP (July / Results 16), JapanOP (July) and World Championships (August).
Although the number is small compared to other top players, it is scheduled to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, it was only one of the world's first competitions, so the fatigue would not be greater than the time of the race.
The high-level results from the middle-tier competition from September are required.
Ace of Taiwan, which is strong in line.
I also focus on young Thai people.
At the same time, he has already participated in the 7th prize at the top competition of IndonesianOP and ThaiOP (S500).
He also participated in the local TaipeiOP (S300) in September and won a grand prize.
Originally, the sport is strong, and the players who don't compete.
Even if the tournament continues, there is no major issue in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would have been easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Until last year, it was an impression that the explosion had been made, but this year the stability of the play has been maintained, so it is possible to continue its composition.
For Momota, one of the world's top rankings, it seems to be more troublesome than ever before.
In addition to the two players, the results were made in the first half, but the young Ace-Kanta font of Thailand's Sai Pra Nice B.
And it is the third player of the Unders Anton line, who has taken part as a European tax.
Although Kanta Fon is not the only one to enter the final competition, he is in the best 4 in the second round, and has the highest level of value.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20 years old (aged 21 years old on 18 days) that the rally was able to compete with the top players will have a great chance to leap in the race.
In addition, Sai Praise B. went out a step forward in India where he had a high-ranking player in his singles.
There is a need to pay attention to the Indochina since the midfield, as the Samir Rosema, Pranoh H.S., and the Srikans Kidama, who is behind the injury, will continue to increase in the future.
New pricing in the form A fair competition in the form: Hokkaido Shimbun Market
In October, a new fee plan for the mobile phone company accompanying the revised Telecommunications Business Act was launched.
But it was generally high.
The Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications said, "There is a room for about 40% to leave," and despite the rising expectation of price reduction, price competition did not come out.
Rakuten's full-fledged entry has been forwarded, and it is a major factor that continues to follow the three major rivers.
For consumers, it is desirable to be a fair competition that makes it easy to use.
I would like to ask for efforts by mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits the set discount of terminals and communication volumes.
Instead of mathematicalizing the terminal system, it was a setting that would be close to both sides of the communication.
SoftBank Corp. and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize the number of terminals.
However, both of which are 100 days, the "SIM Lock" that cannot be used by other companies is the system for terminals.
NTT DOCOMO also has a maximum number of three terminals for only its own subscribers.
The three companies will continue to "contract" to prevent transfers to others.
With regard to SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications required an immediate release.
Companies need to respond promptly.
The postponement of Rakuten was due to the fact that the development of communication networks such as the base station did not proceed as planned.
It was hoped that it would become a gastronomic agent of the competition, so it was a cool thing to cut down.
I think there was a positive outlook.
The start of the full-scale service and the prices were not clear.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, I want to work on business with responsibility.
The price revision led to the presentation of the Minister of Internal Affairs.
"I think that the competition will start in the future, and I don't think that it's going to be that good," he said.
However, I don't think that "the reduction of sensitivity" will bring the market to a healthy competition.
The company should develop a competition in the customer's mind before the government is left behind.
The price structure of each company is very complicated and it is not easy to compare.
While the terminal is advertising like "up to half-priced", the consumer called for attention as there is a case where the consumer's burden exceeds half.
We need to make a polite and easy-to-understand explanation so that we can not misunderstand you by ourselves.

U.S. FL Qualga Raft, former England representative, "I don't call it coming".
Japan's Rugby World Cup (Wh Yes) The United States, which was the last one in 20 countries, participated in the Rugby World Cup in England on June 26.
Although it became black and white, in the latter half, the rafters played by Fread Kuil are reading the ripple.
I tried to add a shoulder to my face.
The real scene is also available in overseas media, and the former England national team is "a insult and a playful".
[Video] "It's an insult and an oversea play" and overseas.
More than a single shot, the two military players get confused ...The real moment of the U.S. representative Kuil played, "the face of danger"
The hot investment exceeded the line.
The second half of the year was welcomed by 0-38.
It was somewhat balanced when the Prime Minister of England in a deep way caught the path of his way.
I went to this place, but it was dark.
However, he did not leave the hips, and he was forced into the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with the shape of the figure.
Farrell was intense and fell.
Take a lecture as if the English player is going to play a clearly justified game.
The two groups gathered together and became the first air in the air.
As a result of TMO's video judgment, Kuil is more than a single shot with a red card.
I left the pitch with a bad face, but from the audience looking for a fair play, I was also asked for some brushing.
Rugby Competition New Zealand's local media "staff" is featured in the 2019 Rugby W Yes: The U.S. players have lost their headlines that the U.S. has played a solid role, and England will be eliminated."
"Kil had a shoulder charge in the face of the English star Farrell, and it became more severe."
In the article, we will introduce a comment by the former England national team member Go Monagna.
He said, "It is an insult, and it's not a sign that you can call it a long-term play."
The U.S., who wrote one game, managed to get out of the game with a try of maintaining 81 minutes.
However, Kuil's play left a bad taste.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced on September 26, the first of the 424 hospital names, which judged that the number of public hospitals, such as the 1455 public hospitals nationwide, and the number of public hospitals was weak.

⇒Responsibilities of the 4 hospital to be restructured "It's wrong"
In order to suppress medical expenses inflated by the aging population, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate with hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, I would like to ask for a full review of the restructuring and integration of the hospital and to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no power today, there is a possibility that local claims and repulsation of residents will be expected due to the lack of familiar hospitals.
The meeting was announced on the same day.
The hospital had a relatively small number of beds, with a total of 29 percent and 1%.
In the prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%) and Miyagi (47,5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43-30%).

Based on the data for FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals that can respond to "previous genitals" for patients with serious illnesses, based on the data for fiscal 2017.
We analyzed the clinical results of 9 items, such as cancer and emergency medicine, and whether the conflicting hospital would be in a place of "around 20 minutes by car" and judged the need for a hospital name.
The hospital is subject to consideration for the removal and transfer of some medical care to other hospitals.
The amount of medical expenses increases in the 25 years, when all the children of the stage are over 75 years.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health has set the goal of reducing the number of beds of a hospital in the total number of 1,206 cents in 18 years.
At present, the number of beds of the "high-grade age" and "old age" that can be placed and medical expenses is high.
In response to the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate the hospital, each prefecture formulated the Regional Medical Concept, which sets the number of beds required for 25 years.
Many local residents and claims have maintained their cautious stance, although they are divided into 339 areas throughout the country and discussed by local governments and medical officials.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare aims to revitalize the discussion by publicizing the hospital name that is lacking in its performance.

The 9 recommended areas for these vaccines are recommended: Gifu Shimbun Web - Yahoo!
On March 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a revision of the trade guideline to prevent the spread of the infection of "buttons" of livestock infections, which prevents the spread of the "buttons" of livestock infection.
The target area is a policy to select 9 types, such as Gifu, Aichi, which have confirmed the infection in pigs and wild boar.
The movement of living pigs and fertilized eggs, etc. that have been fed, is limited in the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is recognized.
Through public comments to the general public, we aim to complete the procedures in October as early as possible.
By using the vaccine and acknowledging the distribution of meat, it is possible that international organizations will no longer use normal countries, which may affect the export of pork.
After the outbreak of September last year, Japan was in a state where the status of the country was temporarily held.
Based on the opinions of experts on areas where the risk of infection from wild boar to pigs, the recommendation is set in the recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefectures created a vaccine intake program consisting of a range of intake, time, number of heads, etc., and allowed the use by the governor's decision.
The other seven prefectures that have been raised as recommended areas of intake are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the area has been amended, the situation will be decided again.
The movement of pigs and wild fluids, fertilized eggs, stomach and excretions, etc., in principle limits the region.
Regarding meat and processed products, they are not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and are virtually unacceptable for distribution.
To prevent the spread of viruses, we will thoroughly process food waste.
We will also respond to the safety of pigs that have been taken and prevent damage to the balloon.
The revised drafting of the guidelines was compiled at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Trade Operations Headquarters.
We will continue to introduce opinions and public comments to the prefecture until October 7, and implement new trade guidelines.
It's an open approach to the Honda Keiyo and Manu.
"We don't need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo!
September 28 (Saturday) 2: 57 Delivery
As far as the last year, the Australian and A League's Melbourne Billings were discussed, and the current no-one's GI-F Honda Keiko began to take a surprising action.
[Video] I was in fact in the game.
The truth of the Heaven is revealed.
Mr. Honda, who updated his own Twitter at midnight on March 27, said, "Please make a offer, but you don't need money, but you need to play with a great team and a great teammates."
The other person who sent the reverse offer is Manchester United, the world's most prestigious.
Why did Honda make a grand request for the first competitive club in the Premier League?
The first time was the article of the Australian version "FOX Sport" released on 24th.
In the article entitled "The five FWs that Manchester United could not be captured in the danger of being injured", five of the players who were not currently able to acquire were picked up.
There were also the names of Honda among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha and Giuseppe Rossi and Willad Boney.
At present, the FF Pole Pogba and DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bylly, FW Antonie Maltier, FW Marcus Rushford and others have been in danger.
The Red Devil, led by Ole Gunner Sewher, has been forced to make two wins and 22 highs in the league, and has a challenge in the quality of the front line.
So it was Honda that the media named it as a new candidate for tattooing.
In the article, the contract of Honda, a creative side player, rather than a slicker, can fill a hole filled by Andreas Perella.
The score of 9 in the 18 matches at the Melbourne Bikure is a solid record, but "The 33-year-old Honda needs to be fully attracted by the fact that it is necessary to leave the Cambodian representative or enjoy management.
Is it true that the approach of Honda is?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move for the next year's Tokyo Olympics as the goal is for the veteran.
The installation of the 500 portable translation machine will be completed in Hamamatsu Shogi, and will be invited to the store. | Shizuoka Shimbun Attez
A portable translation machine called Poke Talk, which is invited to 500 stores in Hamamatsu city, etc.
On the 26th, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce announced that it had completed the establishment of 500 units, including stores in the city of Hamamatsu, in an effort to invite a mobile translation machine called Poke Talk.
It is said that it is the first country to deploy the translation machine in the same area, and it is attracting attention to the improvement in response to inbound tourists.
The breakdown of the number of restaurants in Thailand was 236, retail stores 11:3, accommodation 17, and 134.
The core of the verb accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" also started to show the location of a "foreign-language store" on smartphones.
You can access the site of Hamanako Tourism.
In response to the 74-language Poke Talk's intangible invitation, the nine organizations in the city received the "Japan's Best Inbound Support and Hamamatsu" declaration, and started in April.
In the past two years, the shogi shop has purchased 500 units, acquired a hospitality certification, and a small and medium-sized business site that meets the requirements of the introduction of cashless payments.
The manager of the Shogi said, "I want to connect to the development of new foreign customers as the operating environment is severe."
Ikemura Hiroshi Ikemura is now no longer needed.
Today's Caddy's best shot
The first shot is not always well-up.
When you want to earn a distance from the 2nd of the Part 5, you can get a ball on the ground, so it is called a "direct dryer".
In recent years, the 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of melting the ball, but there are many players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroshi, who has the first tour.
The age of 24 in the professional seven years has a height of 166cm and is currently 7th in the Dry Bing Di stance category (average 304.02d).
While focusing on long shots, one of the challenges was the fairwaywood accuracy.
In the first half of spring, "I thought I would try to do straight dryers because I didn't shoot a spoon (3W).
From the practice round to the height of the area, you can pull the ball over and throw one W into the ball.
In cases where Big Cary is required, it is used to make use of direct dryers such as a narrow hall.
You can use it in the hall where the eyes are closed.
In the Dando measurement machine, he recorded 270-d- 280ds in the carryer.
"Because I don't have 3Ws, it's easy to get more confidence than 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, wood is only one W in the Caddy bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees.
I am also happy to hear the easy voice from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to put the club at a level.
He said, "Even if it's going down, it's not going straight, but it's a cut-start, and it's the first time to force the swing of the 1W shot."
The ball doesn't roll out, and the risk of the slices is associated with the left side, so the left side is not bent to the left.
It's easy to say, but it's a professional technique that makes me feel comfortable.

You will be able to do a different time.

Garcia wedge shot
I thought that it would be possible to get the momentum in the second half, but it wasn't so good that the number of people could not bus well.
Is it possible to win the 6th Eagle, the 7th Bardi prize?
Even after the 4th edition of the Boggy, the Par5 had been left, so if I had done it with the feeling of being replaced, the 6th edition of the Chip Ingle came.
Even in the 7th edition, Bardi was able to get used to the opportunity, but it was nice that he could not be a place for the second half.
What did you get at this conference?
Because I didn't have a lot of shots, it was good that the fairway was able to keep firmly in the narrow course.
It was a course that changed the distance between the rough and the opposite eye, so I didn't have much experience.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
I think it was possible to shoot a camera.
I didn't like it at all, but there were quite a lot of people in the gallery.

Although it continues in the second round, I want to win more than one prize if I don't win, so I'm going to win more than one prize, so I'm going to go to the top competition, so I'm going to hide the title of the competition.
What is the way to prevent dementia?
Interviews, stories and stories of Watanabe Yoyo.
The major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenge research and development to prevent dementia.
However, it seems that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been clarified, and it is likely that it may be possible to inherit and forget.
I talked to Prof. Shunsuke Ohtsuki, a leading professor at Kinki University Hospital.
There is no dementia.
What about the current situation? - - Prevention of dementia, or treatment, but what about it?
There is a difference in the degree from minor inheritance to seriousness, and if everyone grows older, it may become dementia.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Drugs that are often used in Japan are already in some countries overseas, and can not expect significant sensing effects.
On the other hand, people have been able to come long as the death of infectious diseases and accidents has decreased due to remarkable progress in treatment such as cancer and anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that more dementia patients are increasing.
It is necessary to create an environment where people and families can only be resolved, as a whole.
How to stay at the level of forgetting.
Is there a person who is prone to dementia?
Even if it is inevitable to become a large dementia, it is possible to reduce the symptoms as much as possible and get back to the degree of forgetting.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle habits and tends to be one of the cheapest people.
First, the people of Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is captured as a lifestyle.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol levels.
It also affects the absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are areas where people distribute food tickets to the poor, but food that can be fed with food tickets is hamburgers and pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity can not be used, and people living in an environment where they can't cook.
Then, it becomes a meal with fewer vegetables and proteins, and it becomes a type of life in lipids and fats.
Eventually, the poor will become obese, and if you do it, you can only watch the TV and the body will be free.
The same situation can be in Japan.
In addition, people who are not thinking about things tend to be more prone to dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books every day.
