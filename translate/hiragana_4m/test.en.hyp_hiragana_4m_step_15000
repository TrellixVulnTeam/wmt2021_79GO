Driving in high heels is dangerous!
A small start (Auto Mesis Web) - Yahoo! News
Acts that violate the Road Traffic Act violations.
It's a big mistake to think that it's only an elderly driver, although the number of accident reports due to malfunctioning such as pedal mistakes is increasing.
The number of times the number of times the number of times a year-on-year-old pedal accident occurs (the number of police chief data in 2015) is 1080 and the number of cases is higher than the number of persons aged 75 and over 1032.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
Do you take a stylish look at your feet?
Do you take safety?
Unlike the elderly who are often considered to cause the fall of the body, such as driving skills and reflected nerves, this data is not written for men and women.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the dress of the day, such as high heels, pups, sandals, and mullets.
Some people say it's hard to change while driving, but some people don't think they can lead to danger at all, and many people are driving bad.
However, the driving in Haiheel and Yadal is set in the road traffic laws.
The first is to ensure the operation of the handle, brake, and other operations, and to ensure that the driver must not be driven to cause an accident, "a violation of safety driving obligations".
Second, in Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the provisions set forth by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in the case of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Act Enforcement Act, the number of vehicles will not be able to wear kimonos that may interfere with the operation of the vehicle (excluding some vehicles).
In each prefecture, it seems that the seeds that are considered to violate driving in the "hamono that may interfere with driving operation" even today.
Why is it dangerous to drive in the lung heels?
It is obvious if you consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safety-proof pedal operation, the legs are fixed on the floor and the legs are perpendicular to the brake pedal, and the legs are tilted to the right as a point of view when the accelerator pedal is pressed.
At this time, it is important to ensure that the car does not fit properly, regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in the high heels, the area of the heels installed on the floor is small, the area is always gradated, and the height of the heel has an angle to the entire foot, so the area of the foot to be installed on the pedal is also small, and the fine adjustment becomes difficult.
It is thought that this will lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get a heel or not, and when the heel is stuck in the brake, the pedals are not taken, and the heel is attached to the cover, and the heel can be pulled to the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is also a case where the heel pulls to the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedals are no longer returned.

Is it common to see the mysterious beauty and the appearance of the shadow?
From the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and in August 2019, the "Mizu Kazuo Bi Girl's Collection" which focuses on the beauty girls drawn by Mr. Kazuo Umeda, known as the first-person of the horror manga.
When you look at it, you will be aware of the correlation between "bi" and " fear" of the work of Umezu Kazuo.
[Image] It is attractive because there is a shadow.
Umezu Kazuo's long-awaited girl (with five pieces).

There are many keywords that appear in Umezu Kazuo's works, but the snakes are captured as "beauty creatures" by the viewer, and people who feel "beauty" are different.
There are some people who like reptiles in the world, and some say they don't like them.
In this way, the "bi" and "simultaneous" of the viewer may be the "same" creatures.
In addition, this creature has been revered as a living creature with high spiritual power since ancient times.
There is a series of "The Snake Girl" and "The Girl of the Madamura" in the 1965 series "Mamaga scary!
It is the market that there is a shadow that becomes a snake woman.
If you're going to say it's a "Cool Beauty" type, it's nice to say...I feel like it's common among the young girls who appear in the work.
In particular, the "Orochi", the leading character of "Orichi", which has been serialized in the Weekly Boys' Day since 1969, is the representative character of Umezu's work, but it reminds us of a snake that has a deep sleep every hundred years in order to maintain the eternal life and eternity.

"New Murder" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Iran's "Ava Beer," which was used for this bombing, has been dramatically improved by analyzing the drone of the US military that crashed.
It can be manufactured cheaply, and the subsequent distance is about 1000 km.
The strength is that it is difficult to capture radars in order to fly to take-out."
On September 14th, the oil facility of Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Arabia, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization "Fushi" in Yemen has announced a criminal statement.
"The reason why Mr. Fung is behind is that Iran, led by President Rouhani, will certainly not be able to forgive the Saudis who are against Iran, in a situation where the country cannot export crude oil, if it continues to take oil embargo against Iran, it is aimed at informing the international community that the pain is appropriate."
In response to the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production was stopped, and the crude oil price recorded 15%.
In the case of this, there is a voice that the oil shock is coming out.
"I want to avoid any military intervention until the election is over, at least until the next year's election has ended, but Iran will continue to bomb drones in hiding the city, but the United States will not be able to endure forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "traffic war" are the first time to come to the crisis.
The reason why YouTuber has become a professional employee is the reason for his long personality.
Listen to the president who has been adopted (bizzSPA!).
September 27 (Fri.) 8:47 Delivery
YouTuber, which is now one of the most popular young people.
It is not unusual for companies to make use of their products for advertising, but there are companies that have started to use YouTuber as their own employee.
Direct marketing mix (hereinafter referred to as DmMiX) is a company's main business of CRM (customer-related management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
He was the CEO of DmMiX, and this time I listened to Mr. Koichiro Kobayashi, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff who was actually YouTuber.
I would like to support young people who are working with YouTuber.
What is the " YouTuber adoption" in the first place?
Kobayashi: Now, the occupation of YouTuber has become a year of many young people.
In the future, the number of junior high school students in the professional rankings will increase.
Until now, we have adopted young people who have been chasing dreams such as band men and comedians.
In the same way, the young people who have been chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber are trying to support them.
How do I use it? – I think that YouTuber is an image that individuals can voluntarily post video posts, but why did I consider it to be "utilized"?
Kobayashi: While many young people are keen to be a profession called YouTuber, most YouTubers are not able to raise their earnings as they thought.
There are many creators who are working on video production and posting while working as a part-time job, as well as creators who do not recognize the existence of YouTuber in their family.
In this effort, we will provide the environment for making payments and content to the creators who are employed.
At the beginning, I believe that we will support our activities by supporting the benefits of the occupation of YouTuber, which will become a precarious position.

Sakura shrimp, born this year in the deep sea of Suruga Bay, was successfully shot in the sea of the sea.
The "Yuhi-Sakura Project" of the Ocean Industry Cluster Council, which is based in Shizuoka City, succeeded in filming Sakura-bike shrimp that was born in the summer spawning machine this spring.
The video of the growing process is valuable, and the parties are trying to elucidate the ecology of the sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The filming area is about 1 to 5 km above sea level.
For the 17th minute, we confirmed about 300 tickets.
During the day, Sakura prawns in the deep sea have been reassured by the traditional knowledge of "creating a certain number of flocks."
The body is about 40 mm in the body, and the body is about 23 mm in the body.
They identified the scattered trees as the seasonal data of the fried cherry shrimp.
The detailed analysis will be submitted to Fujitsu Software Technology's and Shizuoka Industrial Technology College.
Yusuke Mizuno's project leader said, "I want to capture the lives of the individual in the growth process, including the shrimp."

In order to increase the number of people living in Chiba by the end of October, it is free to enter.
At the same time as the opening ceremony, many people visited the entrance gate and welcomed the mascot character Chibakun, who was attached to the cheer.
The roof is covered with a blue sheet, and there are some facilities that have been in the state.
Mr. Kenji Mitani, the company of Sagamihara, who visited the family, said, "I was worried about when I was reunited, and I was looking forward to the event of Imoho."

[Bado Olympic Race 1st Round] World champion, Momota Satoshi, and Principality lead the first step!
Men's Singles < (Bad × Spirit!)
The Japanese national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championship (Switzerland Basel) held in August, will finish the training camp in early September, and will participate in the Chinese OP (Thuzhou/Super 1000), which will open from 17th.
Here, we will look forward to the men's singles toward the mid-term (September-December) while the Olympic race, which took place next year at the Tokyo Olympics, started in May-August.
The badminton tournament, which began in May, was held at the end of the world championship, and the top athletes competed in the four tournaments.
In the first half of the race, the principal was Mr. Momota, who won the 2nd prize in the 4th tournament, and Mr. Tomoda, who won the 2nd prize in Taiwan.
Momota won the world championship, the end of the race, and the high points of the "World Ranking Points" that are directly connected to the race in Indonesia's OOP (S1000) and the Olympics.
Momota also made Japan OP (S750).
The tournament, which has been held since May, will be held in Sudillman High (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/the results are 16 Today), Japan OP (July), the World Championship (August).
Compared to other top players, the number is small, but it is a schedule that has reduced the burden on the squad.
In August, it was only one tournament in the world championship, so it won't be much bigger than the race.
In the middle stage, the high-level competition since September is continuing.
Ace in Taiwan, which is strong in the trench.
It is also attracting attention to young people in Thailand!
At the same time, he won the top prize in Indonesia's OP and Thailand's OP (S500) competition.
In September, he competed in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the prize.
He was originally a physical athlete, and he won't win the race.
Even if the competition continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the match.
Rather, it would be easy to adjust the schedule of the tournament that will be held in the first half of the year.
It was the impression that the end was unexplored until last year, but this year, the stability of the play made it possible to continue its composition.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, it seems to be a tougher opponent than ever.
In the first half of the race, he left the results in the first half of the race except for the two players.
In addition, he is a three-seater of Unders Angton, who has been involved as a European tax.
While Kantafone is not a high-class competition, he is the best in the second round of the competition.
There are still some rough faces, but the 20th-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th-year-old) who have been able to rally with the top players is a great presence in the Olympic race.
In addition, Sai Pranias B. has passed away one step in India, where he has a single player.
In the future, it is necessary to pay attention to the Indian characteristics of the mid-term line, as the Samile Barma, Pranoy H.S., and the thrills and dams that have been delayed by injuries are also coming up.
The new fee of the form is a fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun Normal Market
In October, a new fee plan for mobile phone companies was set up due to the amendment of the Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it was generally high.
Despite the increase in expectations for price cuts, the price competition was not achieved.
It is a major factor that the full-fledged entry of Rakuten has been forwarded and the three major rivers have continued.
For consumers, it is desirable to be a fair competition for consumers to be an easy-to-use fee system.
I would like to ask for efforts by mobile companies.
The amendment Act prohibits a set discount on the terminal and communication volume.
Instead of a terminal, it was a setting that would have been set on both sides of the communication.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced a plan to print the terminal up to the maximum.
However, the "SIM Rock" system, which can't be used for a hundred days, is a system that takes place on the terminal.
NTT Docomo will set up to three terminals for only the contract holder of the line.
The three companies are going to continue to "calyp" to prevent transfers to other companies.
Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications expressed its intention to require immediate release.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The postponement of the Rakuten had not progressed as planned for the maintenance of the communication network such as the base station.
Because it was expected that it would be an adversary of the competition, it was a casualty.
I think there was a difference in the outlook.
There is no indication of the start or charge of the full-scale service.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
The price revision was the result of the introduction of the Kankan Taikan.
"I think the competition will start in the future," he said, "I don't think it's going to start."
However, I don't think that the "returning price" will encourage the market to win a healthy competition.
The company should compete with the customer before the government is in touch.
The cost structure of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
While the terminal is making a "maximum-half-priced" advertisement, the Consumer Authority has called attention as a case where the consumer's burden is higher than a half-priced.
We must try to explain what we can understand in a polite manner so that we don't have any misunderstandings.
The withdrawal limit was reduced to 500,000 yen, and the cash card of three new gold in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
On June 26th, the Bank of Japan announced that it decided to reduce the total amount of cash card to the maximum amount of cash card to prevent special fraud.
In the past three years, we have a cash card for each credit card on the assumption that we can withdraw from the cash card at the cash card for over 70 years or older depositors who have not made a certain amount of money at the ATM (the cash deposit machine).
On the 1st of October, the bank will reduce the amount of credit-safety on the 1st of November.
In the prefecture, there is a special fraud case that will be sent to ATMs, with cash cards and PINs that will be used by financial institutions and police officials.

[ Rugby World Cup] The overseas gate "Functionful and Frogant Play" (THEAN SWER) - Yahoo!
In the U.S. FLV Qualgaraf, the former England representative, "It is not easy to stand."
The World Rugby World Cup (W-high) Japan tournament was held on 26th at 7-45 in England, the last in 20 countries.
It was a black-haired caller, but it was later played by John Klein.
He took a shot in a shape like adding a shoulder to the face of his opponent.
The actual scene has also been released with a video, and the former England national team has stopped the special saying, "It is an insult and unspeakable play."
[Video] "Function and Funny Play" and overseas gate!
More than a single shot, the two military players are in a state of turmoil ... the real moment of the "cancer danger" played by the U.S. national Qualta.
The hot investment has surpassed the line.
It was 29 minutes later that I was greeted by 0-38.
It was somewhat balanced when the British Prime Minister Farrell caught the path of the way he was looking at.
I went to this place.
However, it was not from the waist, but it caused a situation, and the upper body was violently.
As a result, the head and head of the other person are in contact with the other person, and the shape is shown.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
Take a lecture on the fact that the English athlete is in the position of the play that wrote the legitimacy.
The two groups gathered together and became the first air in a row.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), the crank was more than a shot with a red card.
After the pitch with the face of the punishment, the audience asked for a fair play, but some of them were beaten.
rugby competition New Zealand's local media "staff" features a headline that the U.S. player has played a solid role in the play, and England is eliminated.
"Kaki was a tough shoulder charge in the face of the England Star Player Farrell, and it became a big hit."
In the article, we will introduce the comments of the former team member, the commentator, Woogo Mogna.
"It's an insult, and it's not a twist," he said.
The U.S., who wrote a match, managed to escape a fan in a 81 minute try.
However, the play of the clumps left a bitter taste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced a total of 424 hospitals, including the 1455 public hospitals and the JRCS, for the first time.
In Fukui Prefecture, the four facilities of the National Hospital of Awara City, the National Hospital of Awala City, the National Hospital of Awala City, were selected for the public health and public hospital treatment results.
4 Hospitals that are subject to reorganization The criteria are strange.
In order to suppress medical expenses that are expanding in the aging society, we decided to take an extraordinary response to the need to restructure and integrate hospitals in the competitive area.
In October, I would like to ask for a full-fledged review of the reorganization and integration of the hospital and to give a conclusion by September next year.
It is not a force today, but it is expected that the local claim and repulsion of the residents are expected from the anxiety that the familiar hospital will be gone.
The meeting was announced on the same day.
The number of beds was relatively small, with a total of 29 per cent of the total hospital.
In each prefecture, the proportion was high in terms of Niigata (53 and 70%), Hokkaido (48 and 60%), Miyagi (47 and 50%), Yamaguchi (46, 7 %), Okayama (43 and 30%).
The number of seats was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only 0.
Based on the data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals that can respond to the general surgery of "high-grade age" for serious patients.
We analyzed the clinical results of nine items, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and whether a conflicting hospital is within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need for hospital registration.
In the hospital that is subject to the examination, we will examine whether the doctor or some medical care will be transferred to another hospital.
The medical expenses have surged in the 25th year, when all the generations are over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in the hospital in 124,6 cents a year (18 years).
Currently, the number of beds in the "high-grade" and "previously" beds, which are placed in the patient's hand and cost of medical care, is high, but there is a lack of need for seniors.
It is necessary not only to simply reduce the number of beds to respond to the aging population, but also to increase rehabilitation.
Regarding the reorganization and integration of the hospital, the "Communication Concept", which sets the number of beds required for each prefecture for 25 years, is formulated.
Many of the local residents and claims have remained cautious, and the debate has been debated.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has announced a poor number of hospital names to promote the discussion.
The total number of people participating in disaster prevention drills, such as aquake eruption, a road, etc., was wide, and in the 18th year (video) : Hokkaido Shimbun Public Corporation
On September 27th, a total training of disaster prevention, which was planned for the eruption of Koma-kyo (1131 meters), was held in the town of Torishima, the seven-year-old, and the city walls.
There were about 400 people, including 20 staff members and residents, including the road and three towns.
This is the first event since the Hokkaido Komakuka Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated a evacuation plan that included residents' evacuation routes in August.
The training was held for the first time in 18 years.
At 8:45am, the village of Komagake erupted, and the town of Sanroku was reached.
When the eruption warning level was raised to the 5th evacuation, the shelter was opened in the town of Mori, and the residents were moved by bus and road vehicles.
Even in the climate of Vancouver, 100,000 students appeal for school breaks and global warming. - Yahoo!
On September 27th in Vancouver, about 10 million people, mainly students who have been empathized with Grega Tumberg, an environmental activist at the age of 16, responded to climate change.
Even in the climate in Vancouver, the climate in Vancouver is very similar.
The update took place from the Vancouver City Hall to the downtown library.
A few hours before the meeting place's office building, people with plastic cards began to gather, and at around 13 o'clock in the start time, the number of people fill the road before the city hall.
After that, more than 100,000 people participated in the event.
On the road along the way, the police also worked on the road, and watched for a few hours until everyone had finished.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York, the city of Vancouver will host many events to think about global warming from the last weekend.
On the last day, the school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who lived in this day school responded that "we want to protect the earth even if we want to do something important as a school," and many adults who have been working for a while, "we will be able to work for the future of children who are thinking seriously."
9 Brain Recommended Areas of Pig These Vaccinations - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on 27th the amendment of the Trade Guidelines to prevent the spread of the infection of "buttons" of livestock-related diseases, and to prevent the use of this drug in the present day.
The target area is to select nine Gifu and Aichi prefectures that have confirmed infection in pigs and wild boar.
The movement of living pigs and fertilized eggs is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is recognized.
After conducting public comments to the general public, such as public comments (reference of opinions), we aim to complete the procedures in October.
The use of vaccines and the distribution of the meat, etc., may affect the export of pork, which has been certified by international organizations.
Since the outbreak of last September, Japan's status as a country of normality was in a temporary hold.
With regard to the area where infection risk from wild boar to pig infection is high, the experts have decided to set up a "communication recommended area".
The target prefecture will create a vaccination program that summarizes the range of ingestion, the time, the number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures that have been raised as a recommendation area are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the guidelines have been revised, the area will determine the situation very much.
In principle, the movement of pigs, fertilized eggs, fertilized eggs, the body, and excretion are limited to the region.
With regard to meat and processed products, they are not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions or the impact of farmers.
To prevent the spread of the virus, we will thoroughly process food waste.
In response to the safety of the pig that has been ingested, he also works to prevent the damage of the fish.
The revised draft of the Guidelines was compiled into a meeting of experts on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Trade Counter Headquarters.
In the future, we will introduce opinions and public comments to the prefecture until October 7 and implement new trade guidelines.
A public approach to Honda Keiko, who has no affiliation, and Manu!
You don't need money, you can't do it. - Yahoo!
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 Delivery
As far as the last season, I had a conversation with the Australian and A-League Melbourne District Court, and I was surprised to see how I was currently a member of the MFJU.
[Video] Honda Keiko, in fact, was in the match?
The truth of the heaven is revealed.
Honda, who has updated his own Twitter at noon on Sunday, 27th at night, said, "We need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world's famous gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the premier competitive club in the Premier League?
The reason for this is in the article of the Australian edition FOX Sports released on 24th.
Among the articles entitled "FW of five people who may be caught in the crisis of the death of the Manchester United, five of them were picked up to be able to win the event.
There were also names of Honda among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie.
At present, the injured persons, such as MF Pole Pogba, DF DF Luke Show, FFF Eric Bily, FW Anney Malal, and FW Marcus Rushford, are on the verge of an emergency.
The "red demon" led by Orre Gunner Sazarcher, has a challenge to the quality of the front line, which is forced to slip two wins and 22 in the league.
Therefore, it was Honda that the media named it as a new military candidate for tattooing.
In the article, Honda's contract as a creative side player is described as "can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
In the 18th round of the match at the Melbourne District Court, the score of the 9th place of the tournament is the "Monitory Record", but the 33-year-old Honda has been pointed out that it is necessary to attract full attention from the entertainment of the Cambodian representative.
How do you find a Honda approach?
For the next year's Tokyo Olympics tournament, it is also attracting attention to how the United moves.

On the 26th, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it has completed a total of 500 units, including stores in Hamamatsu City, in the business of inviting a mobile translation machine "Poke Talk" to a member office.
It is said that it is the first country to be deployed in the region, and it is attracting attention to the improvement of the ability to respond to inbound (Japanese travelers).
The breakdown of the number of restaurants in Thailand is 236, retail 113, accommodation 17 and other 134.
It accounts for 60% of the city's capital.
The map app "Google Map" has started showing the destination, and the smartphone can see the location of the "Japanese language store".
It is accessible from the site of Hamanako Tourism.
It was launched in April by a group of nine members who were not invited to participate in the Poke Talk for 74 languages.
The shogi office will purchase 500 units, and will be able to make it for two years at small and medium-sized business sites that meet the requirements of acquisition of hospitality certification and introduction of cashless payments.
Mr. Shogi said, "I would like to connect foreign customers to the development of new customers while the sales environment is severe."
Ikemura Hiroshi Ikemura, who is now a direct Dora Meijin, does not need to be able to improve.
Today's Caddy's Best Shot
The one-W shot is not always hit and hit.
There is also a technique called "directed" where the ball is on the ground when you want to earn a distance in the second part of the Part5.
The recent one W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of ball tilting, but there are many players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroshi, who won the tour, won the championship.
The 24th year of the professional year is now at the age of 166 cm, and the dry agility department is currently ranked 7th (average 30.4.42dy).
While focusing on long shots, one of the challenges was the fairways Wood system.
In the spring, he said, "I was not able to shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I would try to do it directly."
From the practice round, you can put a ball on the lawn in the Titi area, and you can also throw one W.
In cases where Big Carry is required, it will be used to make use of direct dryers, such as small holes on both sides.
"You can use it in the hall that will be out of the line."
In the first half of the series, he recorded 270-y to 280-yds in the car.
"So, I don't need 3W, so I can't worry about it if it's more than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is the only one in the Caddy Bag.
The second longest club is the loft at 17 degrees.
I was surprised by the tour mates, and I'm happy to hear from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to put the club to a level ( horizontal).
"Even if it's down-buck, it's not enough to fly straight to the upper, it's a cut-start and it's going right.I've been doing a straight dryer to force the 1W shot at the time of Titi-up," he said.
If you don't have a ball, you'll have a risk of slices, but you'll be able to cut the left side (not to turn left).
It's easy to say, but it's a professional work that you can't imagine.

Garcia wedge shot
I thought I could go to the latter half of the year because I had a certain amount of bus.
Did you like to win the sixth Eagle, the seventh bardie?
After losing the fourth time, the par5 was left, so if I had done it with the feeling of replacing it, I had a chip-in- Eagle.
Even in the seventh edition, I was able to get used to the opportunity, but after all, I could not wait for the second half.
What happened in this competition?
I was lucky to be able to keep the fairways in a narrow course, because it was not so good (shots).
It was a course that changed the width of the slope and the distance between the slope and the slope.
What is the difference between regular tournaments?
It was impossible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't like it at all, but it was a video for a pretty gallery.
I didn't have much to do, but I was looking forward to the match with the feeling of "I don't lose to overseas players" because there were only a few Japanese players in the competition.
The second half of the race will continue, but if you don't win more than one prize, you don't want to win more than one prize, so you want to win another prize.
What is the way to prevent dementia and to "get things"?
Interview, Bunka/Wanabe (Watanabe, Yo)
The major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are trying to develop and develop drugs for dementia.
However, it has been known that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been clarified, and it is likely that it can be passed down to the extent of forgetting.
I listened to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki at Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation?
There is a difference in the degree from minor injury to serious injury.
However, it is believed that it will take more than twenty years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, it is already out of insurance, and it is not possible to expect a significant sensing effect.
On the other hand, while the death caused by infectious diseases and accidents is decreasing, cancer death is decreasing due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs, people are able to spend a long time.
Therefore, the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by the person or family, but it is necessary to establish a society as a whole.
How to keep things around "getting things"
Is it difficult for people to become dementia?
Even if it is inevitable to become a large-scale dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and return to the extent of "getting things".
The disease is considered as a lifestyle-related disease, and it tends to be easy to become.
First, the metabolites tend to be prone to dementia.
The disease is considered as a lifestyle-related disease.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the U.S., there is a region that distributes food tickets to the poor, but food that can be obtained with food tickets is a safe and frozen hamburger or pizza or chicken.
You can't use gas or electricity, and people living in an environment where you can't cook in the first place.
If you do this, you will be able to eat less vegetables and protein, and you will be able to live in a diet that is similar to that of lipids and fats.
When it comes to poverty, it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing it, it is only possible to blur the television, and the body becomes free.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things, who do not work, tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day and think about things.
