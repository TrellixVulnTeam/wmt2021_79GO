Driving in Hehar is dangerous!
A young man's pedal is a small flash (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!
Act violations of the Road Traffic Act violations.
There is an increasing number of accident reports due to mismanagement, such as pedal errors, but this is a major mistake that I think only of elderly drivers.
The number of pedal accidents and incidents in the year 2015 Police Agency reported that the highest number of cases was 1080 at the age of 24 and above 1032 over 75.
Undoubtedly, it is important to call attention to the youth as well.
Do you take a stylish look?
Do you take safety?
Unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, this data may have been misled by other things, such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, breadps, sandals, and mulls that day, and some of them drive away.
Some people say that it's not suitable for driving, but it's hard to change, but some don't think about the potential to be dangerous, and there are many people who run without bad luck.
However, Haiheel and Yadal's operations set up in the Road Traffic Act.
One is to "accurately manipulate the handle, brakes, and other operations", and Article 70 of the stipulation that "not to drive the person who causes the accident to harm".
The other, in Article 71 of the Safety Committee, which the driver specifies that each prefectural safety committee must comply with the provisions of the Act, for example, the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Transportation Act, the fastest of the 12th, is "not to carry out any footwear that prevents driving, or to prevent the operation of the vehicle."
It seems to be true that each country, too, is still in violation of the "hasys that may interfere with driving".
Why is it dangerous to drive in Heyhir?
It is clear to consider the basics of safe pedaling operations.
For a safe and secure pedal operation, the first step is to fix the foot's transients on the floor, and then remove the foot to be vertical to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right as the accelerator pedals.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of the car's behavior.
However, in Haihear, the area of the cacaths to be placed on the floor is small, and the area at the height of the heel is always gradated, and the area of the foot to the pedal is also small, and the fine adjustment becomes difficult.
This may lead to danger.
Most cars also have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull the heel, and sometimes the heel pulls the pedals, and the heel pulls the pedals, and the heel pulls them off.
In addition, there is also a case in which he pulls the pedal back, and the accelerator pedal is not removed.

It's also hard to catch up with the radar to fly around."

Shortly thereafter, Yemen's anti-government organization, Fusi, published a statement against him.

After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production was stopped, and oil prices recorded 15% of its supply.
In this case, there is also a voice that calls for oil shock.
"I want to avoid military intervention until at least the next year's election is overshadowed by the military withdrawal from the Middle East, so Iran will continue to bomb the Fushi in the future, but the United States will not be able to continue the bombing of Iran."

The reason why YouTuber became a good employee.
He asked the president who had adopted it.
9/27 (Friday) 8:47 delivery.
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to make use of their products for advertising, there are companies that have begun a rare mechanism of " YouTuber adoption" adopted by their own company.
The company's main business is the direct marketing mix (DmMiX).
What does it mean?
He was the CEO of DmMiX, and this time he heard Mr. Fumiko Kobayashi, who is also a representative of the subsidiary and staff first that YouTuber had adopted.
YouTuber wants to support young people with cancer.
What is the mechanism?
Kobayashi: Now YouTuber's occupation is a longing for many young people.
As elementary school students enter the ranks of the future professions, the number of young people they will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have pursued dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, they adopt young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber, and use them to cheer.
Is YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people have admired YouTuber's profession, most YouTuber has a reality that they don't have any income as they thought.
There are few creators who have worked part-time and posted video production and creators who do not recognize the existence of YouTuber to their families.
In this effort, the company provides an environment for paying and content creators to adopt.
At first, I believe that the advantage of the occupation of YouTuber, which would become a precarious position, is to support and support the activity.

The first race at the Bud Olympics – the world champion, Taota, and the captain's end!
"Bod × Spirit!"
Japan's national badminton team won six victories at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland Basel) in August, ending the strengthening camp in early September, and participating in the China OP (Super 1000), which opened from 17 September.
Here, while looking back to the full sailing of the next year's Olympic race at the Tokyo Olympics, the men's singles look for the middle race (September–December).
Badminton's Olympic race started in May, when the World Championship was finished, the top players in the tournament (super 500) were reduced to four.
In the first half of the race, he played a major role in the first half of the race, winning two victories in the fourth round of the race, and two in the end of Taiwan.
Taota won the World Championships, the end-of-the-world championship, the Indonesian OP (S1000) and the high points of the "world ranking point" connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also produced JapanOP (S750).
The competition that took place from May is the Sdirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesian OP (July/Press 16), the JapanOP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of other top players is small, it is scheduled to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one of the World Championships was held, so it would not be much better than at the end of the year.
After September, higher competition is required for continuous middle-level results.
A Taiwanese ace strong in Rensen.
I'm also interested in Thai young people!
At the same time, he won the top contest of Indonesia's OP and ThailandOP (S500) and was already in the seventh contest.
He also joined the local TaipeiOP (S300) in September and won the championship.
It was originally a physical, and a player who did not leave the line.
Even though the competition continues, there is no major problem with the game's performance.
Rather, by obtaining high points in the first half of the race, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming contest.
The end-point system was an impression that exploded until last year, but this year the stability of the play made it possible to continue the starboard.
For the world's first-ranked Momota, it seems to have become a more troublesome partner.
In addition to the two players, he left the results in the first half of the race, but the young Ace Canta font of Thailand, the oldest Planith B.
It is the three unders.
Cantaphon is not the only one to enter the final at the top of the competition, but is the best in the second round.
Although there are still some rough aspects, the 20th-year-old (18 days 21) that Larry was able to stand up with the top players would have a great chance to leap in the race.
Sai Planetyth B. also went through one step in India, which had a single player.
Samir Balama, Prano H.S., and Surikans Kidhambi, who is behind his injuries, is also brought up in the future, so attention must be paid to the Indochina since the middle stage.
The new price of the form is a fair competition: The Temple of the Hokkaido Newspapers.
In October, a new pricing plan for mobile phone companies associated with the Telecommunications Business Act was launched.
However, it was generally high.
He said that "there was a room to be about 40%" and that the price competition did not take place, despite increasing expectations for price declines.
The full entry of Rakuten was forwarded, and the three major river states continued.
For consumers, it is desirable to be a system of affordable prices for use by fair competition.
I want to seek the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amendments prohibit the set discount of terminals and communications volumes.
Instead of divising terminalization, it was because it was set on both sides of the communication.
The SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize the terminal.
However, the SIM lock, which cannot be used for 100 days, is a system for terminals.
NTT Docomo has a maximum of three terminals for only its contractors.
They seem to continue "calypsing" to prevent the transfer of three to others.
For the SIM lock, it was suggested that the total free would be required to be lifted immediately.
Companies must respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was because the base station and other communication networks had not progressed as planned.
Because it was expected to be a bacterium for the negotiating race, it was a cool one.
I think there was a positive outlook.
There is no clear start or charge of full service.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want to work with responsibility.
This revision of the price was the result of the announcement of the captain.
The surveillance complained about the three new charges that "I don't think that competition is going to start."
However, "reducing completion" does not seem to push the market down and encourage a healthy competition.
Companies should compete with customers before they can be removed from the government.
Each company's pricing system is very complex and not easy to compare.
While the device released ads such as "to be up to half-priced", the consumer chief called attention as the consumer's burden was more than half-priced.
It is necessary to keep an easy-to-understand description of the user's misinterpretation.

In the dark room of the Yokozukula Road, one of the children is a parent-type acute.
The Japanese Sumo Association announced on 27 May that they had approved three children, one of the two children, and one of the children, with the death of their parents, and the death of their fathers (former lords) and one of them.

In the room of the unknown, there is a weight-cutting horse from Mongolia, and 12 people at Akiba.
The Rugby World Cup is an over-a-half-and-a-half-time U.S. player's "an opaque face-to-face" overseas gate, The ANSWER – Yahoo!
The U.S. FLklgaraft, the former English national team, "It's not a tacrut".
The Rugby World Cup (W embryo) was held on the 26th, and the last U.S. in 20 countries played in England at 7–45.
He became a black star, but later played by Fulch Kyle, Laplace is reading the gate.
He was shot in a form that added the shoulder to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene has also been released with video, and former English players have stopped saying, "It's not an insulting and frugal play".
[Videos] "An insult and wreaky play" and abroad!
More than a single shot, the confusion between the two players ... the real moment of the "cancer danger" played by the U.S. national basketball team.
The hot investment surpassed the line.
It was 29 minutes later, with 0-38 greeted.
In the face of the enemy, the prime minister of England, Farre, declined slightly to catch the path.
I went to Tuck.
However, he did not leave the hip, and caused the body to be violently removed.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact and shaped.
Farrell was blown violently and fell.
He protested against the fact that he had apparently written the legitimacy of England.
Both sides gathered at once and became one of the first air in the air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle was more than a single shot on a red card.
He left the pitch with the face of the punishment, but some of the practice of seeking fair play was heard.
New Zealand's local media "staff" featured the headlines as " Rugby World Cup 2019: The U.S. player has played a solid role, and England is dissolved".
"Kill made a tough shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and it was over."
In the article, former English player and commentator Ugo Moña's comment was introduced.
"It's an insult, and it's not to be called a tackle", he stops saying.
The United States, who had written one game, managed to escape from the defeat at 81st.
However, Kuil's play left behind a bad taste.
On 26 September, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare published its first 424 hospital names in public hospitals, such as the 1455 public hospitals nationwide, and the Nisin hospital.
In the Fukui Prefecture, four facilities were subject to the public health care system and 14 public hospitals.
The fourth hospital to be reorganised is "standard".
In order to suppress the aging and expanding health care costs, it was necessary to encourage the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals in competing areas.
In October, he asked for full-scale consideration of reorganisation and consolidation of the hospital, and considered that he would conclude by September.
There is no power, but anxiety about the disappearance of close hospitals is expected to cause local claims and opposition to residents.
It was announced at the same day's meeting.
The hospital had a total of 29–1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53–70%), Hokkaido (48–60%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), Okayama (43–30%).
The number was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health examined 1455 hospitals for "high-grade age" for patients with serious injuries, as well as general "normal" operations.
He analyzed the medical results of nine items, such as cancer and emergency medicine, as well as whether competing hospitals were located in "less than 20 minutes by car", and judged the need for hospital clarity.
In the targeted hospitals, doctors and some medical institutions are considered to be transferred to other hospitals.
The cost of health care increased in the 25th century, when all stages are over 75 years old.
For this reason, the U.S. Department of Health aims to reduce the number of beds in hospitals in 124,6 and 18 to 110,000 cents in total.
Currently, the number of beds of "high-grade" and "old-level" beds for nurses to place and pay for health care is high, while the elderly lack a high degree of rehabilitation.
In order to address the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, the "Communication Concept" was designed to determine the number of beds needed for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 zones, municipalities and health care officials compete, many of the local residents and claims maintain a cautious stance, and the debate has been disputed.
He said that by publishing the name of a hospital with a poor track record, he wanted to activate the discussion.
It is a wide range of people involved in disaster-control drills, such as a path, and is the first of 18 years (video) in Hokkaido Newspapers and Temples in Hokkaido.
Disaster General training, which was intended for the eruption of the Coke (1131 m) occurred on September 27 in the forest of Tori Island, the seven-story, and the city walls.
There were about 400 employees and residents of 20 organizations, including roads and three towns.
It was the first to be held since the Hokkaido Compound Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated a plan to evacuate residents in August.
A wide range of training involving residents was held in 18 years.
At 8:45 a.m., Kosaca erupted, and the town of Sanroku was expected to reach the city.
After the eruption warning level was raised to 5, the forest and the evacuation center were opened, and residents moved by bus and road vehicles prepared by each town.
Even in Vancouver's climate, 100,000 students sued for school breaks and global warming.
About 100,000 citizens, led by 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunbergi, marched in response to climate change on 27 September in Vancouver.
The weather in Vancouver also occurred.
The march took place from the Vancouver City Hall to the Canby Bridge and to the Downtown Library.
A few hours before the city hall of the set, people with plastic cards began to gather before the start, and at 13 o'clock in the start of the city, the number of people filling the road in front of the city hall.
The number of participants continued to increase, and eventually over 100,000 people participated.
On the road along the way, the police also cooperated with road regulations, and watched for several hours until the end of the day.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Change Summit in New York City, the city hosts numerous events to consider global warming from the last weekend.
On the final day of the day, the school strike "Fridays for Future".
The students who attended this day's school said "I want to protect the Earth until I burn what is important as a school", and many adults who took part in the rest of the day responded that "we will do our strength for the future of children who are seriously thinking of learning."
Nine recommended areas of pig cholera vaccine are recommended: Gifu Newspaper Web - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries published an amendment to the Trade Guidelines to prevent the spread of animal epidemics, pigs, and cholera, on 27 days, to enable preventive vaccination of unused pigs.
The target area is intended to select nine categories, including Gifu, Aichi, which have been confirmed to infect pigs and wild wild boar.
Transfers such as living pigs and fertilized eggs are limited in the region, but distribution of meat and processed products is permitted.
After public comments to the general public, he aims to complete the process in October.
The use of vaccines and the acceptance of non-vibrational distributions such as meat may result in the loss of "normal" countries recognized by international organizations and affect the export of pork.
Since September last year, Japan was still in a temporary hold of its normal state.
In an amendment, a "vaccination recommended area" is set in response to experts' opinions regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The relevant prefectures created a "vaccination program", which consists of the range of intake, time, head count, and recommended, and approved the case and allowed use in the governor's judgment.
Other seven of the recommended areas are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.
When the area was amended, it was decided that the situation would be changed.
Moves such as pigs and wild animals, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excites are generally limited to the region.
The meat and processed goods are not subject to the cost of distribution and the influence of farmers, and are effectively unacceptable for distribution.
To prevent the spread of viruses, it is necessary to thoroughly dispose of food waste.
He also sued the safety of the pigs he had taken, and worked to prevent the damage.
The amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at the same day's conference of experts and confirmed at the meeting of the Department of Trade.
In the future, opinions and public comments will be introduced to the prefecture until 7 October, and new trade guidelines will be implemented.
He is a non-member Honda and a public approach to Manu!
"We don't need money" – Yahoo!
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery.
As a result, he had a conversation with Melbourne Bickley of the Australian A-League, and the current non-member grandmaster of the MF Honda took an amazing action.
Is it really a game?
The truth of heaven is revealed.
Honda, who had updated his own Twitter account at midnight on 27 March, said, "Please give an offer, but you don't need money, but you need to play with a great team or a great teammate."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, the world's most famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most competitive clubs in the Premier League?
The reason for this was in the article of the Australian edition FOX Sport, released on 24 November.
In an article entitled "FW of five men who may be taken out of the crisis of Manchester United, five non-members were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa and Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, there were also names of Honda.
At present, United has been injured, including MF Paul Pogba and DF DFK Luke Show, DF Eric Bylie, FW Antony Maltier, and FW Marcus Rushford, which are in danger.
The "red demon" led by Ole Gunner Sorshire, was forced to run two or twenty-two victories in the league, and had challenges in the quality of the line.
There, the state media named it a new force candidate for tattooing.
In the article, Honda's contract as a creative side player, "not strictly speaking and riding, can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
9 points in the 18th match at Melbourne Bickley were "a solid record", but "The 33-year-old Honda has to take full attention away from the entertainment to manage the Cambodian national team."
Is it true?
For the next year's Tokyo Olympics, it is also notable for United's move, due to a veteran who points to the goals.
The 500 portable translation machines were completed in Hamamatsu Shogi, and in the store.
A portable translation machine called Poket, which is invited to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce announced on the 26th that it was a business to invite mobile translators "Poke Talk" to the company's office, and that the installation of 500 cars was completed in stores in Hamamatsu.
It has been noted that it is the first country to concentrate its translation into the same region, and that it will lead to the improvement of the Inbaud response force.
The number of restaurants in Thailand is 236, retail 113, accommodation 17 and 134.
It accounts for 60%.
The introduction of the map app to the Google Map began to show the location of "the store of foreign languages" on the smartphone.
It is accessible from sites in Hamanako Province.
Poket's invitation to speak 74 languages began in April with an effort to declare "Japan's Inbound Support City Hamamatsu" by nine non-governmental organizations.
The Shogiers buy 500 cars, get hospitality, and cashless payments for two years.
The manager of the Shogiers said, "We want foreigners to explore new customers while operating conditions are severe."
Isn't it?
Today, Caddy's best shot.
The 1W shot is not always re-released.
There is also a so-called "Didador" technique to keep the ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance in Part II.
The current 1W is accompanied by the risk of the ball being tilted due to the large head volume, although there are players who frequently practice it on the ground.
The tour's first tour was the Ikemura Hiroshi.
The seventh-year-old, with a height of 166 cm, is currently seventh in the Drying Division (average 304.0.2d).
While focusing on long shots, one of the challenges was the Fairwaywood system.
In spring, the shot of the spoon (3W) was not good, so I thought I would try it straight."
From the practice round to the top of the Ti Area's turf, you can also throw a ball over one W.
In cases where Big Carey is required, Tiup is used, but both sides are effectively used in small halls.
"You can use it in a hole that will turn down."
He recorded 270-did-280d in carry-on.
"So I don't need 3W."
From the June Japan Tour Championship, Wood is only 1W in Caddy bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17°U.
They were surprised by the tour's friends, and they were happy to hear from the eyes of the gallery.
The trick is to "enter the club at a level".
"In the downbrough, it's not as good as the upper, and it's not straight, and it's the right thing to do with the swing of the 1W shot."
The ball does not sink, and the risk of the slice is associated with "So the left side is not bent to the left".
It's easy to say, but it's a professional work that you don't know.

A book of self-published works before Akutagawa's suicide was published in the early days of his life.
The Tabata molecular village memorial is the first to be held at the Tabata molecular village hall, in which the original manuscript of the Book of Akutagawa Ryunosuke is published.
The author's author, Ajitagawa Ryunosuke (1892–1927), wrote the essay of the essay "a literary, too literary" in the trial, which was fought by Ichiro Taniza and the literary theory, which was obtained by 27 December at the Tabata molecular memorial in Tokyo.
From 1 October, they will exhibit it.
It was known that the existence of all of the essays, such as those recorded in the last week, was the first time that the manuscript was published to the public.

A total of 12 copies of the 200-figure manuscript were published in the April 27 issue of the Year of Literature.
Greta Tonbergi, "Why are adults laughing and dancing?"
At the United Nations Convention on Climate Change in New York City, he gave a speech on 23 September to the Swedish environmental activist Greta Tonberg.
While his speech was drawing attention, he was disguising Greta's insult.
"Why are adults laughing and dancing?"
Political commentators commented on Greta's mental illness on American television shows that he was "used by parents and international left-wing", and the television station he used apologized.
In Japan, on the Internet, there are a lot of news about Greta's "used and pretty", such as "good to go to school", and that it is not the content of Greta's remarks.
On 26 September, Greta posted on his own Twitter that "Why adults laugh at ten youths and children, and spend the time in Osno."
"As long as we can think about lies and conspiracy theory."
As Greta said, "As I realized, I'm still active.
As adults did not want to focus on climate and environmental crises, they pointed out that they seemed to have discussed the story.
I don't understand why adults deceive ten youths and children, and how to spend the time with them, honestly.
It would be better than that time.
I think they are threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world has begun to wake up.
Changes have come.
Even though adults like the change, they don't like it.
Let's take a look!
On the 20th, a full-time gold strike on climate change occurred around the world, including New York.

Come to Japan!
Garcia's Wedgeshot shot.
Because it had a certain degree in the first half, it was thought that it would be able to reach its momentum, but because Pater was unable to do so well, he was so poor.
Will he win the sixth Eagle, the seventh Bardi?
After losing Boggy in the fourth episode, Par5 was still alive, so if he had done it, he would write the 6th edition.
In the seventh episode, Bardi was able to take the opportunity, but it was hard to stop it later.
What did you get at the competition?
Because of the fact that he was not good at shooting, he was glad that the Fairway could be firmly locked in a narrow course.
Rough was also a course of varying degrees and distance, so he did not have much experience.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
I think it was possible to shoot a camera.
I didn't like it at all, but I thought it was a lot of gallery.
I didn't have much to do with other players, but I'd like to play the game because I'm a little Japanese player, so I'd like to say, "I'm not going to lose.
It will continue until the end of the race, but if one is not worth it, it will not be able to win another prize, so the ZOZO championship will be at the top of the competition, and you will try to hide the title.
What is the way to prevent dementia from occurring?
Interviews/buns/Watana (Watanabe and Yang).
Large pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenge research and development, and have a severe dementia drug.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has become increasingly clear, and it has been suggested that it may be inherited, and that it is possible to keep things forgotten.
He spoke to Professor Otsuki Shunsuke of the University of Kinki Hospital Center.
There is no dementia.
Is it true?
There is a difference in the degree of severity, from a large injury to a severe illness, and everyone may become dementia after age.
However, the development of new dementia drugs is still thought to take more than 20 years.
Drugs commonly used in Japan are already outside of health care in some countries, and cannot be expected to have significant sensitivity.
On the other hand, the death of infections and accidents has decreased, and cancer mortality has also been declining due to significant progress in treatment such as anticancer drugs, and people have been able to die long.
It is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve problems by himself or his family, and it is necessary to establish an environment in which the community as a whole is safe.
How to keep things around "getting things".
Is there a person who is easy to get dementia?
Even if it is inevitable to become a major dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and be removed to the extent "forgotten".
dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle diseases, and tends to be more likely to be.
First, Metabonos are prone to dementia.
The dementia is seen as a lifestyle disease.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
It also affects economic power.
For example, in the United States, there is a region that distributes food tickets to the poor, but food items that can be obtained on food tickets are stored frozen hamburgers and pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people who live in a food-free environment can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and proteins, and it becomes a diet that is biased in lipids and carbohydrates.
Eventually, poverty becomes obese, and when it comes to quit, it is only possible to watch television, and the body becomes free.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
There is also a tendency that people who do not think about things or do not work can become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day.
