A young man, a young man, is a child's first (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!
A violation of the Act on Road Traffic Law.
It's a big mistake to say that it's just an old driver, but it's a big mistake.
In the case of an accident, the highest number of cases in the world is 1080 at the age of 24.
It is not uncommon for young people to have the same attention.
Is it a lot of fun?
Is it safe?
Unlike the elderly, who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, this data may also be misinterpreted by other factors, such as music and conversation, and may also be misinterpreted due to wear or wearing.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing hierarchy, puppy, sandals, mull, and dress of the day.
Some people believe that it is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think of it as a risk, and do not have a bad drive.
However, the road traffic in Haiheil and Sandar is still under construction.
One of these is the "safe operation duty violation" of Article 70, which states that "the driver should not be responsible for the accident."
In Article 71, for example, in the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Act, the driver must comply with the provisions set by the Nuclear Safety Board, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefecture Act, "Nothing, Slippa, Zug, Hührer, etc., in a way that prevents the operation, or prevents the operation.
In each prefecture, it seems to be a violation of the operation of the "has possible to interfere with the operation".
Why is this dangerous?
It's clear that it's the basic idea of pedaling.
For a safe pedal operation, the foot is first fixed to the floor and then to the brake pedal to the vertical foot, and then to the right of the foot as a point of view when the pedal is lowered.
In this case, it is important to keep the car firmly intact, regardless of the car's behavior.
However, in the heel, the size of the captula is small, and it is always gradated, and the height of the heel and the overall angle of the foot, so the area of the foot to the pedal is small enough, and the fine tuning becomes numb.
This may lead to danger.
Most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to fire, and when it comes to a brake, it is not easy to pull the pedal, and it is not possible that the heel is stuck in the head of the pedal.
There is also a case that when the pedal is removed from the pedal, the heel is stuck in the back side of the pedal and the ax pedal is not returned.

Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament in the future by winning high points in the first half.

It's more difficult to see than the world's top score.

Although Cantavon did not advance to the final at the top level, he was able to win the championship in the second round.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th day) who was able to compete with the top players would be very likely to advance in the race.
Re-Prançois B. also went on to become an Indian player in a single.

The company should continue to compete with customers before they can be removed from the government.
It's not easy to compare.

U.S. U.S. FLkilgaraf Place, former England national team "It's not a tackle".
The Rugby World Cup (W High) was held on 26 October, with the last United States to be represented in 20 countries in the United States on 7–45.
He was also a member of the club, but later played by FL John Kyle.
It's like adding a shoulder to the other side.
The actual scene has also been released by foreign media, and the former England national team has stopped saying, "It's an insult, a rough play."
"It's funny and funny to play!"
More than a minute later, the two men were in a faltering fashion ... the actual moment of the "Ganmen danger" played by the U.S. national team.
High investment increased beyond the line.
It was 29 minutes later that year.
In the face of the enemy, the English prime minister Farrell had a slightly more balance when he caught his sidepath.
I'm going to do this, but I'm crazy.
However, he was forced to leave his body, rather than leave.
As a result, the head and head are in contact with each other.
Farrell was badly beaten and fell.
It is an example of the fact that the English player must be able to play the game.
The two men met each other in a single air.
As a result of TMO, Kyle is more than a red card.
He left the pitch in the face of a punishment, but some of the audience asked for fair play was upset.
New Zealand's local media "staff" is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: The U.S. player has played a rough game, and the English will be eliminated".
"Kills made a rough shoulder charge on the front face of the English star Farrell, which became more frequent" and "was almost a warhead by both sides".
In the article, former English player Hugo Moña gave a comment.
"It's an insult, it's not a big hit."
In the United States, a single game was played in the United States in the 81st minute.
However, Kyle's play left a bad taste.
The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare announced the first 424 hospitals in the United States on 26 September, when it was judged to be "very poor" of public hospitals, such as the 1455, and the National Hospital.

"The Fourteenth Hospital" is the only one to be re-established.
It was an unusual response to the need to reorganize and consolidate hospitals in the competing regions, in order to reduce the health costs of the population.
In October, he called for a full-scale investigation of reorganisation and integration to the hospital, and by September of the following year he decided to conclude.
There is no strong opposition, but local claims and objections are expected to be made due to concerns about the disappearance of a nearby hospital.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The hospital had a total of 29–1% of the hospital and a relatively small hospital.
In the prefecture, Niigata (53–70%), Hokkaido (48–60%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).

In the hospital, it is recommended that doctors and some medical services be transferred to other hospitals.
The cost of health care increased to 25 years, with all the generations aged 75 years.
As a result, the U.S. Department of Health aims to reduce the number of hospital beds in the country to 1,110,000 cents.
Currently, there are a large number of "high-grade" and "normal" bed beds, with high demand for rehabilitation for elderly people.
It is not only necessary to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and consolidate the hospital, the "regional health care plan" was set for the number of beds required for 25 years.
Many local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance, and there is no debate.
The Ministry of Health has stated that it wants to increase the number of hospital names, and that it is necessary to promote debate.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issued a revised Trade Guidelines to prevent the spread of "butts" of livestock epidemics on 27 October, allowing the use of unrecognized pigs to be taken into account.
It is recommended that nine countries be selected, including Gifu, and Aichi Prefecture, who have confirmed the infection of pigs and wild boar.
Transfers of living pigs and fertilized eggs are restricted to the region, but the distribution of adult meat and processed food is permitted.
In addition to public commenting on the general public, it is recommended to be completed in October.
The use of the vaccine and the ability to distribute meat and other food products in the world may have an effect on the export of pork, which has been certified by international organizations.
In September of the same year, Japan's status as a normal state was temporarily suspended.
In an amendment, a "vaccine recommended area" is set in response to expert opinion regarding the high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
A "vaccination program" consists of the range of ingestion, time, head number, and recommended dose, and allows the use to be approved by the governor.
The other seven provinces that have been raised as the recommended area are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.
The area decides to change the situation when the guidelines are revised.
Transfers such as swine, fertilized eggs, body, and excretion are generally restricted to the region.
For meat and processed goods, it does not take into account the cost of distribution and the impact of farmers, effectively allowing the distribution of goods outside the area.
To prevent the virus from spreading, it is necessary to clean up the food waste.
They also seek the safety of the pigs that have been taken into account.
An amendment was made to the Council of Experts on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Department of Trade.
In the future, a new policy of trade will be carried out until 7 October.

"What's the game?
The truth of the heavens is revealed.
Honda responded to his Twitter address at midnight on 27 October, saying, "We don't need money, but we need to play with a great team or a great teammate."

Why did Honda make a grand offer to the Premier League club?

The "Red Devil", led by Orle Gunner Suarshal, was forced to make two wins and 22 laps in the league and had problems with the quality of the line.
It was the first time in the United States to name a new force for the use of tecole.
In the article, "It is not strictly a striker, but as a creative side, Honda's contract can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira."

It is the best shot of today.
The 1W shot is not always up and down.
There is also a technique known as the "directed" to keep the ball on the ground when the player wants to earn a distance, such as the Part 5.

"I'm going to the right with a cut-off, not straight at the top, but in the right, I'm just playing a hand-to-hand for the 1W shot's swing at the start of the game."
