it's dangerous to drive in hierno!
it's a young pedal.
a violation of the road traffic law
it's a big mistake that i think it's only an older driver.

all the prefectures of the world are still looking for a violation of the laws that can prevent driving.

for a safe pedal operation, you're going to fix your leg on the floor, turn your legs perpendicular to the brake pedal, and you're going to the right.
it's important to keep it firmly in place, regardless of the behavior of the car.
but, in haejar, it's a small area where it's placed on the floor, and it's always gratts, and because the height of the heel has the angle of the foot, it's a small area of the pedal.
this may lead to danger.
and most of the cars have a floor, but this material is easy to catch, and when you hear the brake, you don't have to pull the pedals.
and in addition, when you pull your pedals back, he's stuck on the back of the pedal, and he's gone.
