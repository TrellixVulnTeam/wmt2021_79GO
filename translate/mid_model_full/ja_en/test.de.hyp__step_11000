Driving in Heels is dangerous!
A number of young people's pedals were triggered by a number of errors.
A violation of the road traffic law.
There are more reports of accidents caused by false manipulations such as the pedal's mistakes, but it is a big mistake to think it's just a problem for elderly drivers.
More than 24-year-old 1080 cases, up from 1032 over 75 years, the State Police Office data showed.
It is not the case for the elderly, and it is important to attract attention to young people as well.
Is it going to take a footing?
Is it safe?
The data does not include the ratio of men and women, but it is likely to be a mistake of taking care of other factors such as driving skills and reflection nerves.
In particular, women chose various shoes, including high heels, breads, sandals, mulls and late outfits for the day, and some people were still operating.
Some people know that it is not appropriate to operate, but some say it is a hassle to change clothes, but there are many people who do not think they can risk.
However, the operation at Heheels and Sandal would be linked to road traffic laws.
"We will ensure that the handling, brakes and other operations are manipulated," one said in Article 70.
The second issue is a violation of the provisions of the No. 71, which the operator must comply with the provisions of the local government's National Committee, which would prevent the operation of the road traffic laws in Miyazaki Prefecture.
The same purpose of each prefecture would be a breach of the operation of "hard wear" that could prevent operation, even if it did not say it was a high heels.
So why is it dangerous to operate in Heels?
It is clear that it will consider the basics of pedal operations safely.
In order to ensure safe pedal operations, it will be fixed to the floor and set foot on the brake pedal to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, pushing it to the right.
It is important to keep it firmly fixed without any action of the train.
But the area near the floor is small, with the area always pegged, and the high of heels and the area near the foot of the pedal is too small and it is difficult to finely adjust.
This could lead to danger.
Most cars have floor carpets, but this is easier to pull the high heels or not, and can prevent the heels from slipping into the back of the pedal if it's heavy braking.
In addition, heels were pulled back to the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal was lost.

"The Iranian drone Ababil, used in the bombing, has improved performance in recent years by analyzing crashed U.S. drones.

There is also a voice that the oil shock will return.

The reason why ultra-personal YouTuber became a regular employee.
Asked by the president who used the company, Biz SPA!
September 27 (gold) 8:47
YouTuber, especially young people, is now very popular.
It is not unusual for companies to use them to advertising their products, but there are companies that have begun a rare mechanism of using YouTuber as a regular employee.
Direct Marketing Mix Inc, the main operating company's CRM business, said.
What does it mean?
DmMiX is a member of the company's board of directors, and I would also like to hear Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is actually a representative of the company's subsidiaries and staff, who has been employed by a YouTuber.
We would like to support young people who are hiring YouTuber.
-- What kind of mechanism does it mean?
Yuki Kobayashi said: Currently, the job of YouTuber has become a long-awaited youth.
Young people will continue to grow, with primary school students entering the top vocational rankings in the future.
In the past, we have adopted young people who have been pursuing dreams such as Bandman and comedians.
In the same way, it is the " YouTuber adoption" to help young people who are seeking a dream of becoming a YouTuber.
-- I think it's an image that the individual is going to make video posts independently, but why did you think it's going to be employed?
Kobayashi: While many young people want to be a YouTuber job, most of the YouTuber is not likely to be profitable.
There are not too many creatives that can allow video production and posts, or a family YouTuber.
The project will provide a living environment for job creation and job creation.
At first, we will support the benefits of YouTuber's job devalue, which will be an unstable position.

"We hope South Korea will return to GSOMIA." - Yahooo!
U.S. Deputy Prime Minister Yasuo Napper said on Monday he would like to reconsider the decision by South Korea's decision to scrap the newspaper in Tokyo on November 23.
It is unusual for a senior U.S. official to mention a re-assembrance of GSOMIA.
South Korea, Japan and the United States and South Korea respectively are the basis to share missile information.
South Korea's decision to scrap a bilateral agreement with Japan in August would disrupt a framework to protect military information in Japan and Korea.
"We can't respond effectively without GSOMIA," Napper said.
"There is time to get rid of," he said.
"It is a threat to the first time ever history of a joint flight training in Japan's ocean skies in July," he said.
"We will hurt the interests of the United States," he said.
"There is no intention of intermediaries," he said.

WASHINGTON - World King Momota Kenjiro and a strong Zhou Tenshin were leading a step ahead!
Men's singles (Bad × Spirit!).
The Japanese National Assembly, which won six big events at the 25th World Championships in Bedminton in August, will join China's POP, which will reopen in early September, the official said.
"We will look back on the first round of the May-August race to be held in Tokyo next year, and see the boys' singles for mid-September (December).
Badminton's Olympic race, which began in May, digested the top players' competition to meet at the end of the world championship.
"We're going to have two people in Taiwan's Zhou Tenten (Claude) and Momota Kenjiro, who won two in the first half of the session.
Momota won the World Championships and Zhou Tensei won an "World Ranking Points" tournament which will be linked to the race of the Indonesian OPEC and the Olympic Games.
It also holds JapanOP (S750).
In May, the Sdile Man Cup (May/China), IndonesiaOP, JapanOP (July/July) and World Championships (August) were held.
Although the number of other top players is less than others, the schedule has been set to limit the burden.
In August, only the world's first tournament, it would not be more tired than in the war.
A good result is needed in the middle of the session since September.
Taiwan's ace, strong in the war, said.
Thailand's young people are also looking for!
He also won the highest level in Indonesia's OPEC and Thailand's S500.
He was also in the local TaipeiOP in September.
He originally said he was strong physical and did not suffer the war.
There are no major problems in the performance of the game even after the tournament continues.
Instead, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
It was an impression of a lack of blast until last year, but this year's more stable play has allowed the company to continue its performance.
It's likely to be an unsettled partner for the world's largest peach field.
The two players left the results in the first half of the session, with a young Thai ace Kantaphanon and Indian cyclone Pty B.
"It's three players in the unders-Anton Seng, who are fighting for a single European army.
Cantafonton, who is not in the top competition, has won the best four in the second season, he said.
There are still some volatility, but the 20-year-old (21-year) is likely to have a big leap in the Olympic race.
Ciplatnies B. was also a step ahead of a single player in India.

New mobile phone charges fair competition reduced prices: Hokkaido newspapers
The new toll plan for cellular phone companies due to the enforcement of the telecommunications business law in October was set up.
But most of the gains remained high.
"There is room for about 40 percent in the summer of last year," he said.
It was a major factor behind the recent surge in the open of three major companies.
It is desirable for consumers to be a system of rates that are easy to use by fair competition.
I would like to ask for the efforts of the companies.
The amended law prohibits a set discount for terminals and telecommunications fees.
Instead of selling lows on the terminal, telecommunications fees were set to rise.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make up and up to half the terminal.
"SIM Lock" which does not use other lines for 100 days is a system for terminals.
NTT DoCom has a maximum of one-third of its terminals for only its subscribers.
Three companies will continue to "close" to prevent them from transferring to other companies.
SIM Lock said it would require an immediate release of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay was due to the planned launch of a telecommunications network such as the base station.
It was expected to be a bullion at a low-priced competition.
I think there was a chance of the outlook.
There was no indication of the start date or rate of the service.
I would like to work on a responsible business as a company responsible for social infrastructure.
The change was triggered by remarks by Treasury Secretary Suga.
"I don't think we're going to start competing," Suga said in a statement.
"But I don't think it's going to push the market down and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should compete in the customer's main position before the government exits.
The system is very complex and not easy to compare.
The central bank cautioned consumers' burdens over a half-per-half level, while the terminal said they would be up to half.
The company must try to give a clear and easy-to-understand explanation so that it does not make a misunderstanding of users.

He said he needed to reorganize and merge with hospitals in rival regions to reduce medical care for aging.
We will ask for a full review of the reorganisation and integration of the target hospital in October and give a conclusion by September next year.
There is no force, but local chiefs and residents are expected to rebound because of fears that the hospital will be closed.
It was announced at a meeting on Monday.
The hospital, which covers 29-1 percent of the total, has many hospitals with relatively few beds.
In addition, the percentage of Niigata, Hokkaido (48-06 percent), Miyagi, Yamaguchi and Okayama were high.
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, with only zero Okinawa.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry said on Monday it had investigated 1455 hospitals to respond to "accelerative period" for severe patients in public and public hospitals.
He said nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, as well as those competing hospitals were "less than 20 minutes" by car.
The hospital will consider removing and transferring some medical care to other hospitals.
Medical care is expected to grow in 25 years when all the mass generations are 75 years old.
As a result, the Ministry of Trade has set a target of reducing the number of hospital beds to 119.1 million beds in 18 years.
At present, there are a lot of "accelerative period" and "accumstance" beds which are used for nursing care, while the need for high rehabilitation for elderly people.
In order to cope with aging population, it is not just cutting the number of beds, but needs to increase the number of beds to rehabilitation.
In the reorganisation and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has set up a "regional medical plan" with a number of beds needed for 25 years.
Local and medical officials have discussed the country, divided into 339 zones, but many local residents and chiefs remained cautious and the debate was difficult.

The Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture, nine counties recommended for pig cholera vaccines - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture said on Monday it had revised a quarantine package to prevent the spread of the outbreak of the outbreak of the outbreak of the disease, which has not yet been approved by the government.
The target area will be selected for nine counties, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have confirmed infection in pigs and wild Inosi.
The movement of living pigs and fertilisers in vaccinations will be restricted to the region, but the distribution of meats and processed goods is unacceptable.
The company will complete the procedures in October as soon as possible after public comments on the public.
By using vaccines and allowing foreign distributions such as refined meat, it is no longer a "cleaner" approved by international institutions and could affect pork exports.
Since September last year, Japan has temporarily suspended its position as a clean country.
Under the plan, the Ministry of Agriculture has set up a "communised zone" based on experts' opinions about the high risk of infection to pigs from wildlife.
The prefecture has created a vaccination program, which includes the scope of vaccinations, the number of heads and how to proceed, allowing the governor to use it as confirmation.
The seven other counties, which are recommended for vaccination, are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
The region will review the situation when the guidelines are revised.
Movements such as immunised pigs, sperms, fertilisers, dead bodies and freezers are generally limited to the region.
It will not be subject to the cost of distribution limits and the impact of farmers on the distribution limits, allowing the distribution of refined meats and processed goods to be virtually outside.
It will not spread the virus, so it will thoroughly process food waste.
We will appeal to the safety of the immunised pigs and prevent rumors from being damaged.
The proposed amendment to the guidelines was confirmed at a meeting of a meeting of the National Assembly for Disease Control and Prevention.
In the future, the government will hold a new anti-aircraft guide to the prefecture and public comment until October 7.
It is an open approach to Honda Keisuke and ManU!
"We don't need money." - Yahao!
September 28.
Last season, he left the Australian A League of Melbourne Victory and was now in a surprising action by Japan's former MF Honda Keisuke.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was in the game.
The truth is clear.
"We will not need money, but we have to play with a great team or a great deal," Honda, who renews its own twitter at midnight on Monday, said.
"The other person who sent a backward offer was the world's Manchester United.
Why did Honda have a spectacular request to the top Australian Club of the Premier League?
The trigger was in a Australian article published on Friday.
In an article entitled "FW of five people who are likely to be caught in the crisis of the death of Manchester United," five players were now available.
The name of Honda was included in players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Juppe Roche and Wilfrared Bonny.
At present, U.S. injuries, including the MF Paul Pugba and DF Rouge Show, DF Eric Bily, FWantny Malst and FW Marcus Rushford were in emergency.
"Red devils", directed by Aure Ginner Surrol, have been forced to lose 22 won in the league and have a challenge to the front quality.
So it was Honda who named the Australian media as a new military candidate for Teco.
"It's not strictly a strikeer, but a creative side player, Honda's contract can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Perira," the article said.
"The 33-year-old Honda needs to draw full attention from his entertainment to manage Cambodian representatives," said nine of the 18 games in Melbourne Victory.
Isn't it true?
He said he was also interested in the United's move because of a veteran who would say the next Tokyo Olympic Games.

The city's Central Zone accounts for six percent.
It also began to show lending to Google Maps and said the location of a "foreign language-enabled store" on the smartphone.
It can be accessed by the site of the tourist area of Lake Hamana.

Cadi's Best shot today
The 1W shot is not necessarily up.
There is also a so-called "directal" technique to try to get the ball on the ground when you want to get away at the second round of the par 5.
OneW has a risk that the ball is scattered because of the large volume of heads, but players often practice it in the field.
It is the first victory of the tour.
Pro's 24-year-old age was 166-cm tally, with the current 7th level in the driving sector.
While he was good at long shots, one of the challenges was fairwaywood.
"I think we're going to try to do it because we've got a shot of a spoon (threeW) in spring."
There is also a drop in the ball on the grass in the area from the practice round.
In the case where Big Care is needed, the two sides are used to make use of direct aid in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hole where the line is down."
On the other hand, two80yds were recorded in the calysrie.
"So I don't have 3W," he said.
Wood was only 1W in the cash bag from the Japan Tours Championship in June.
The second longest club was Loft 17.
I am also pleased to hear that the war law, which will be surprised by tourers, will leak from the gallery.
"We're going to move the club to level," he said.
"Even if it's not going straight to the upper level, it's a cut track, it's just right to go," he said.
"So the left side can be erased (not left) because it is a risk of a slice without the ball.
I think it's a professional skill that I'm not sure.

What is the way to prevent dementia from falling to "forget" about?
News/bun/Watom Watanabe
A major pharmaceutical and university hospital has been set to challenge research and development.
However, it was clear of the relationship between dementia and lifestyle, and it could be very light and forget.
I was speaking to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki, a graduate of Kinki University Hospital.
No dementia.
- What is the current situation?
The difference between Otsuki's mildness and the severity of the disease could be dementia if everyone gets older.
However, it is expected to take over 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Drugs that are often used in Japan are already out of insurance in some countries abroad, and they cannot expect a noticeable completion effect.
However, the death of infectious diseases and accidents has been reduced and cancer death has also been a major breakthrough in treatment of anti-cancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that patients with dementia are increasing.
It is not just a solution to the person or family, but it is necessary to create an environment for peace of mind in the community as a whole.
How to keep it down to the extent of "I forget."
- Is there a person who can become dementia?
If it is inevitable that Otsuki's dementia, there is a possibility of keeping the symptoms as low as possible and keeping them down to "forget things".
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be easier.
First, people tend to become dementia.
dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
The presence and absence of the economy will be affected.
For example, the U.S. has a place where it distributes food tickets to the poor, but food tickets for food can be frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity can not be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook.
Soybean and protein would be a little meal, which would have biased to fat and sugar quality.
Eventually, poverty is going to be obese, and the only thing to do is to see the television, and the body will become unfree.
Similar circumstances can be Japan.
Other people who don't think of things or work tend to be dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, we have to consider reading books since the day.
