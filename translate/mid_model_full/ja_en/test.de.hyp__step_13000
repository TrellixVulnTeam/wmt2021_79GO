However, in Haihele, the area is small enough to land on the floor, and always the grables, and the height of the heel and the angle of the whole foot, making it difficult to make microscopic adjustments, so that the area of the foot tangent to the pedal is small and solid.
This is believed to be dangerous.
Most of the cars are made of carpets, but the materials are smooth, and the heels are pulled down, and the heels are unable to walk, and the heels are cut off by the heels, causing the Heil to be cut off and cut off into the pedal.
In addition, when the pedal is pulled back, the heels move back to the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedal has not been recovered.
