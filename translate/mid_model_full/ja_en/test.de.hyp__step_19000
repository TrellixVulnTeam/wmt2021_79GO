It is dangerous to drive in high water!
Younger pedals A lot of mistakes (Auto Mese Web) - Yahoo!
Road Traffic Act violation
Although the news of the accident caused by errors such as pedal steps is increasing, it is a big mistake that only elderly drivers think.
The number of accidents that occurred during the period of the year (2015 data from the Ministry of Police) has exceeded 1080, more than 75 years old.
It is important not to make mistakes for the elderly, but to attract attention to the younger generation as well.
Do you take the Oshale of the foot?
Do you take safety?
There is no mention of this data of male and female ratios or cause, but unlike elderly people who are often considered to suffer from a decline in their body, such as driving skills and reflections, it is possible that young people are aware of other things, such as music and conversation, as well as some mistakes due to clothing.
In particular, there are people who choose a variety of shoes depending on the day's dress and drive them.
Some people know that it is difficult to change their clothes while they are not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think of the possibility of danger at all and are driving without worrying.
However, driving in Haihele and Sandar is a violation of road traffic laws.
The first is to ensure the operation of the handle, brakes and other operations, and the 70th Article "Do not have to be able to operate in such a way that accidents can cause harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the requirements set by each prefectural public safety committee, and for example, the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act applies to Article 12 "not to wear slippers, slippers, screws and other opacity items, or to prevent operations.
The purpose of each prefecture is to consider driving in "a garment that may hinder operation" even if it is not specified as a hijahide.
Why is it dangerous to drive in a high-heater?
It is obvious if you think about the basics of making a pedal operation safely.
For a secure pedal operation, the feet are fixed to the floor, and the feet are vertical to the brake pedal, and when you take the accelerator pedal, you tilt the feet to the right.
It is important to keep firmly fixed at this time, regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, due to the small size of the area in the high-heater, the area around the floor is small, and the area of the foot on the pedal is small, making it difficult to adjust the fine.
This can lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material can be pulled with a high-heath, and when there is a steep brake, the pedal is pulled and the heel is pulled and the heel is pulled away, and the heel is pulled away, and the heel can not be pulled in the back of the pedal.
In addition, when the pedal is pulled back, it is possible that the heel is pulled back to the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At the beginning, he started his business as a lumber manufacturer in Nishiwamachi (present-day South Awaji City) in Mihara County, Japan.
In October 86, the merger of the Co-Japan Kokan (stock) and the business of the Kinki Industry (shareholdings) took over, and the company moved its headquarters to its current location.
After that, the company opened its business base in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Omin City, Miyazaki City, and other cities, and it became the basis for the previous day's Yabuki.However, due to the change in consumer demand, today, it is manufactured by 70 percent of western tiles such as flat plate tiles, and 30% of Japanese tiles.
The company has built a wide range of sales infrastructure in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction and roof construction companies.In December 2004, sales of approximately 31,600 yen were reported.
It was well-known as the top wooden manufacturer of Awaji Island.
However, due to the decline in the housing market after the Lehman Shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, the demand for the roof of consumers was growing.
In addition to the decline in profits associated with the rise in fuel prices, the company was forced to invest in a continuous deficit with excessive advantages associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment.
For this reason, although the financial institutions were trying to reconstruct the management by request to mitigate the repayment conditions of the loans, the recovery of the business situation gradually began.
I was not able to come here to support the business, and this was done.
The debt is currently under investigation but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

The image of the snake that overlaps the beautiful girls of the work (Mamikos) - Yahoo!
In common with the mysterious beauty and the expression of the shadow?
From the 1950s, a number of works from the 1950s to the present day were sent to the world to introduce the focus of the beautiful girls, known as the first person of the horror manga series.
When you look at it in hand, it is noticed that the correlation between "mi" and "think" of the work that is not shown in the picture.
[Image] It is attractive because there is a shadow.
There are five beautiful girls of the work.
In the preface of The Beautiful Girl Collection, there was a single sentence, "There is the beauty of the girls in the opposite direction, but the beautiful face is changed to the expression of the remorse ...
There is a keywords called "sweeps" that appear in many of the works, but the snakes are captured by the viewer as "unfortunate creatures" or "beautiful" or "beautiful".
There are people who like reptiles in the world, but some people don't like them.
In such a way, it may be that "mi" and "ugly evil" are the creatures of the back.
In addition, this creature has been venerated as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and the house where the "white snake" lived is well connected.
The theme of the book is "Storage" in 1965, and there are "Mothers!
It is the sum of beautiful women who have a shadow to become "Wabi woman".
If you say it's cool, it's good to say "Courvation" type.......I feel like a common sense of beauty girls in the picture.
In particular, since 1969, the main character of the "Keeki" series, which was serialized in "The Sunday of the Week" is a beautiful girl character, which is a representative of the work of the painting, but it is reminiscent of a snake with a deep sleep every 100 years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

Why is the children's dining room now?
Mr. Yuasa, President of the NPO and social activist, spoke the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the aging population, the area became deserted and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
Therefore, "people and people were required to have an exchange base in the area where people were living together."
In addition, it is a multi-generation exchange venue for children's dining halls.
Not only do you keep eating alone, but also provide support for childbearing and elderly health.
We cut the chain of poverty and put the region well.
The most important thing is that you don't have children from there."
There are a wide variety of places to offer meals every day from the month.
The venue is diverse, ranging from several to hundreds, from individual houses to temples.
The atmosphere is getting people who want to do.
The low level of such a place is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
You can also hear challenges such as safe management systems.
Even though it is a step-by-step gesture, "it will change your values by engaging many people," says Yuasa.
It seems like a light of hope for a closed society.

YouTuber I would like to support young people who are working hard to adopt YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is the adoption of YouTuber?
Kobayashi Yuki (Kobayashi) : Now the profession of YouTuber is a lot of young people.
It is also the top ranking of the professions that elementary school students want to do in the future, and the number of young people who aim for the future will increase.
In the past, we have adopted young people who have pursued dreams such as Bandman and comedians.
In the same way, we adopted a young man who pursues the dream of becoming a YouTuber and is looking for support.
"Why do you want to use YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are attracted to YouTuber's profession, most YouTuber is not profitable as I think.
There are few creations that are creating videos and posting while working as a part-time job or not allowing your family to recognize YouTuber.
This initiative provides an environment for paying and content production to the adopted building.
At first, we would like to support our activities by supporting the demerits of our profession that will become unstable.

Japan, who won six medals at the Big Badminton Big Event held in August and the 25th World Championship in Basel, Switzerland, finished the strengthening camp in early September, and will compete in the Chinese OP (Nihonshu/Super 1000) which will open from the 17th.
Here, I will look forward to the men's singles to the mid-September (December) while looking back on the first half of the competition from May to August.
The Badminton Olympic race, which began in May, digested four top-ranked competitions (more than 500 Supers) at the end of the World Championship.
In the first half of the tournament, he was one of the two who won two of the four championships, Kento Peachta, and Zhou Tian (Chow Tien).
Tamata won the World Championship, which was won by the Indonesian OOP (S1000) and the "World Ranking Point" which leads directly to the Olympic race.
In addition, the Japanese OOP (S750) is also controlled.
The competition from May to May will be held at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), IndonesiaOP (July/July) and JapanOP (July) and World Championship (August).
Although the number of other top players is small, it is a schedule with a lot of burden on the body.
In August, it was only one World Championship event, so it would not be much more fatigue than a coalition war.
The best results of the competition from September to September are required.
Taiwan's ace strong in the fight.
Also note to young Thai people!
He also won the Indonesia Open and the Thailand OOP (S 500) championship in the top seven tournaments.
He also competed in the local Taipei OOP (S300) in September and won the competition.
Originally, the player who is not struggling with a fight with a strong physical strength.
There is no major problem with the performance of the game even after the competition.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the competition to participate in the future by winning high points in the first half.
By the end of the year, it was an impression of a lack of explosive power, but this year, the stability of the play was increasing, so I could continue to perform well.
For the world's top ranking of the world, it seems to be a good opponent more than ever.
In addition to these two players, the result was a young Thai ace, Kantabon, and the Indian Sai Pra Nice B.
He is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is fighting for an independent army.
Kantaw is not able to advance to the final at the top of the competition, but he is able to advance to the top in the second quarter.
Even though there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18-year-old) who was able to rally against top players is quite likely to leap in the Olympic race.
In addition, Sai Planey B. has made a step away in India, where he is a good player for singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S. and Slikans Killambi, who is behind in Kega, are also driving up in the future, so it is necessary to care for the Indian population after the middle of the war.
New rates of mobile phones The price drop in fair competition: Hokkaido Newspaper
Amendments in October The new toll plan for mobile phone companies was introduced following the implementation of the telecommunications business law.
But it was very high.
Mr. Kenji Sugawa said that the price competition had not occurred despite the high expectations of the price drop, saying that the price was likely to fall by about 40% last summer.
It is a major factor that the full-fledged entry of the music is sent and the oligarchy of the three major companies continues.
For consumers, it is desirable to become a tax system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits the discount of the terminal and the communication fee.
Instead of selling the terminals, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminals up to half.
However, both companies have a system that uses "SIM Lock" which is not available for 100 days.
NTT Docomo is the maximum of one-third of the terminals for only the contractor in the company.
The three companies will continue to show that they will keep moving to other companies.
Regarding SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs expressed the policy of requiring immediate cancellation.
The corporate side also needs to respond quickly.
The postponement of the music was not due to the establishment of communication networks such as the base station.
The price reduction was expected to be a trigger for the competition, so it was worn with a shoulder.
Maybe there was a sweet prospect.
The start of full-scale service and fees are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on projects with responsibility.
The price change was triggered by Mr. Sugawa.
Mr. Sugawa expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it will be good."
However, it does not seem that the government's price reduction will cause a healthy competition.
The company should develop customer-leading competition before it is triggered by the government.
The rate system of companies is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Agency called for attention because the consumer's burden was more than half the burden on the device's advertising, such as "upper half the price".
We must try to explain carefully and easy to understand that companies themselves do not make mistakes for users.

[ Rugby W Cup] Replacement of the U.S. player's face-to-face danger Tuckle is a sign of "Affiliated and Sublime Play" (The ANSWER) - Yahoo!
The U.S. FL Quill is Rough play and the former England representative is not called "Tuckle".
Rugby World Cup (W cup) The final appearance of the tournament was in 20 countries, and the United States finished 7-45 in England.
Black Star was launched, but the raffle play played by FL John Quill in the second half is called a wave.
There is one exit in the form of adding shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene is also released on video, and former England national players are also struggling to say that they are "false and unobtrusive play" and "not to be called "tuckle".
[Video] "Affected and sublime play" and overseas wave fingerprints!
This is the real moment of "face danger tackle" played by U.S. Representative Kyle.
The hot fighting spirit crossed the line.
It is a late 29 minute greeted at 0-38.
The enemy was deep and the English captain Farrell had a bit of balance when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tuckle to do so.
However, he raised his body rather than from the waist, and he had a strong body.
As a result, the opponent's head and head are contacted and shaped like a head.
Farrell was blown up and fell.
Clearly protest against the play without legitimacy as an English player leaps into Quill.
The two sides gathered together and became an air of one touch.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill is dropped from the red card.
But after the pitch with a bad face, some of the audience calling for fair play was asked to be booed.
Rugby Strong New Zealand's local media "staff" features rugby W Cup 2019: The U.S. players are on a modest play, and England is happy.
"Kill was forced to withdraw from the shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell," he said.
In the article, former English representative and commentator Hugo Moña commented.
"It's a shameful and uncompromising thing, it's not called a tackle," he said.
The U.S., who had missed the game, managed to complete the match in an 81-minute try.
However, Quill's play left behind the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labor, Labor and Welfare announced the name of the 424 hospitals in Japan, which had decided that there was a lack of clinical experience among public hospitals, such as 1455 public hospitals and Nijo.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Labor inspected the public and public hospitals for treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.The National Hospital Organization of the National Hospital of Japan's National Hospital in Nahai City played the Three-Year-on-one Hospital in Tsuda-cho.
⇒Restructured 4 hospitals "standard"
In order to reduce the medical costs that have been expanded by the aging population, it is necessary to promote the reorganization and integration of hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we asked for a full review of the reorganization and integration of the hospital and decided to conclude it by September next year.
There is no force, but the opposition of local mayors and residents is expected due to anxiety that the hospital will be closed.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The target hospital was 29 percent of the total, and there were relatively few beds.
In prefectures, Niigata (53–7 percent), Hokkaido (48.6 percent), Miyagi (47.5 percent), Yamaguchi (46.7 percent), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, but Okinawa was the only zero.
The Ministry of Health and Labor investigated 1455 hospitals in the public and public hospitals based on the data of the 2017 fiscal year to respond to the "highly acute phase" for severe patients and to the "acute period" of general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical results, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and the need to publish the hospital name by analyzing whether the competing hospitals are located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital will be closed and some clinics will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical care is rapidly increasing in 25 years when all of the mass generation are 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor aims to reduce the number of hospital beds to 1,191,000 beds in 1246,000 beds in the country.
Currently, there are a lot of beds in the "High Acute Period" and "Aute Period" where nurses are carefully placed, while elderly people have a high need for rehabilitation.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary to simply reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has established a regional medical concept, which sets the number of beds needed for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 areas, municipalities and medical professionals have discussed, many of the local residents and the mayors have maintained a cautious attitude, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Labor has announced the name of a hospital with poor performance and wants to connect to the revitalization of the discussion.

Pig cholera vaccine recommended area 9 prefectures of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water, Gifu Newspaper Web - Yahoo!
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced an amendment to the epidemiology guidelines that can be used to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as pigs and cholera.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild Inoshi.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is restricted to the region, but the distribution of sperm and processed goods is permitted.
After public comments (reviews) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October.
With the use of vaccines and recognition of the distribution of meat, such as meats, it is no longer recognized by international organizations, and can affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been in a temporary state of purification.
According to experts, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water has set up "a recommended area for vaccination" in response to the high risk of infection from wild Inoshi.
The prefecture has created a vaccine vaccination program with a range of vaccinations, times, heads, and ways to proceed, and is confirmed by the Ministry of Education and approved by the Governor.
The other seven prefectures, which are listed as recommended regional plans for vaccination, are Saitama, Fukuyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Saga.
When the guidelines are revised, the situation will be decided very carefully.
The movement of ingested pigs, semen, eggs, corpses, ovaries, etc. is limited to the region in principle.
For meat and processed goods, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact of farmers, and is effectively allowed to distribute outside.
The virus is not spread and the processing of food waste is thorough.
We appeal to the safety of the infected pigs and to prevent wind damage.
The amendments to the guidelines were compiled at the same meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Countermeasures Division.
In the future, a new epidemiological guidelines will be implemented by conducting public comments and opinions to prefectures until October 7.
A public approach to Man U!
"Don't need money," said Yahoo!
9/28 (local) 2:57 (transmission).
As far as last season, Mr. Yusuke Mmotoda of Japan, who is currently unaffiliated, left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League.
[Video] Keisuke Honta actually appeared in the game.
The truth of heaven is revealed.
Honda, who has renewed his Twitter at midnight on the day of the day of Japan, said, "If you don't need money, you have to play with a great team or a great gamble," and made a public approach to a club.
The other person who sent the "inverse" was Manchester United.
Why did Honda make a grand request for the prestigious Premier League club?
It was launched in the Australian version of FOX Sport, which was released on 24th.
In the article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United might be able to grasp in the crisis of the wounded," five unorganized athletes were picked up.
Some of the players including Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfried Bonnie were named Honda.
At present, there have been injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailly, FWantney Mals and FW Marcus Rushford.
The "Red Devil" led by Ore Gunnar Shrwallow was forced to win 22 matches in the league and have a difficult slip.
This was why the Australian media named Tata as the new force candidate for the teco.
In the article, "Instead of strictly speaking, it is not a striker, but as a creative side, Honda's contract can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
Melbourne Victory's 18-game score of 9 points is a solid record, but it is also pointed out that the 33-year-old Honda needs to attract full attention from his entertainment to manage the representative of Cambodia.
What is the Honda approach?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward due to the veteran who will announce the goal of the Tokyo Olympics next year.

Today's best shot
1 W shot is not necessarily tackled.
If you want to earn a distance in the second round of the 5th, there is also the so-called "Dra" technique.
The recent 1W has a large head volume, which brings the ball to disperse, but there are also players who practice it frequently on the ground.
The first victory of the tour is the Ikemura Rishi.
Pro 7's 24-year-old is 166 cm in height and is currently 7th in the Dryving Resistance Division (on average 30.4.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
At the beginning of the spring, I decided to try a directdra, as the shot of the spoon (3W) was dame.
You can drop the ball on the grass of the ti area from the training round, and you can also throw 1W.
In the case where Big Care is required, both sides use direct-dra in narrow holes.
"It can be used in the hall where the eyes are lowered."
In the ballistic instrument, he recorded 270 yd to 280yd.
"That's why I don't have 3W.
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood in the Caddy Bag is only 1W.
The second long club is the 17th UUT.
We are also happy to hear the feeling of leakage from the gallery that we see.
Are Coates "playing the club to level?"
"Even though I hit the lower blow, I didn't fly straight.......... it's a cut-down orbit, but I'm going to right....... it's a direct-dra in order to correct the swing of 1 W-shot.
The ball does not catch and the risk of slices, but the left side can be erased (not curved to the left).
I say to Kantan, but it's a professional technique that doesn't think.

Mr. Greta Toombelli "Why do you laugh and intimidate your children?"
Mr. Greta Toombly, a Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech has been noted, it has been introduced to insult Greta.
"Why do you laugh and intimidate your children?"
The political critic said that he was mentally ill on the American television program, and that he was used by his parents and international left.
In Japan, on the Internet, there are many reports that Mr. Greta has said, "It's good to go to school" and that it is not the content of Mr. Greta's speech.
On September 26, Mr. Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why don't you use time to laugh and intimidate teenagers and children?"
"I would like to think of lies and conspiracy theories as long as possible."
Mr. Greta said, "The people who hate me, as you are, are active as usual......... my clothes, my attitude, and my attitude, and I am driving a different place, and they think about the lies and conspiracy theories as much as possible."
And the majority did not want to deal with climate and environmental crises, but they pointed out that they seemed to have a lot of discussion.
Why do people laugh at teenagers and children and use time to intimidate them?
You can be different at that time.
I think, they feel threatened with us.
But do not consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
The change is changing.
I don't like that, but I don't like it.
Let's see it on Friday!

Dodge shot
I thought it could be possible for the second half because it was up to the first half, but I wasn't able to extend it very well.
I saw the 6th Eagle, the 7th Bardi win?
After hitting Boggy in fourth place, the p5 remained, so when I was back, the chip-in Eagle came in sixth place.
I was able to get a chance at No. 7, but I was sorry that I could not extend it in the second half.
What did you get to this conference?
Since it was not so good (shot) in recent years, it was good that Fairway was able to do well even in a narrow course.
Rough was also a course that changed the distance between the eyes and the opposite, so I had no experience, so I studied quite well.
What is the difference between the regular competitions?
(Note that the camera could be shot.
I didn't care about it, but I wanted to take a video or a photo.
I didn't have any other changes, but it was just a competition with few Japanese players, so I felt like I won't miss the game.
If you don't win more than one prize, you'll be able to win another, and you'll be able to enter the top of the ZOZO championship so you'll be able to get the qualification to the next round.
What is the method to prevent dementia and keep it to a degree?
Interviews, sentences, and Watanabe Masayuki (Wa.
Large pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are challenging research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and living habits has been elucidated and it has been shown that it can be very mild and forgotten.
I talked to Dr. Toshiyuki Otsuki, a professor at the University of Tsukuba Hospital.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation? – the prevention of dementia or the treatment of medicine is awaited.
Even though there is a difference between Otsuki's mildness and severity, everyone can get older and become dementia.
However, it is still thought to take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Drugs that are often used in Japan have already been out of insurance in some countries overseas and are not expected to have significant completion effects.
On the other hand, people have been able to live long, as the death of infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have been declining due to the rapid progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
It is also true that the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
It is not only possible for me and my family to solve the problem, but it is necessary to create an environment where people can live safely in the region as a whole.
How to keep in mind.
Is there any person who is easy to become a dementia?
Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to reduce the symptoms as much as possible and keep them as possible.
dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, the metabolites tend to become dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are areas that distribute food tickets to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers and pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity can not be used, and people who live in an environment where they cannot cook.
Then, there is a small meal of vegetables and protein, and it is a life that is divided into fat and sugar.
After a while, poverty is becoming obese, and if you do it, you can only see the TV and your body is free.
Similar situations can be found in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things are likely to become dementia.
In other words, it is necessary to consider things that are not metabolized in order to prevent dementia.
