Driving in the high heels is dangerous!
There are many accidents (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
Road Traffic Act violations
It's a big mistake to think that it's only a problem with elderly drivers, although there is an increasing number of reports of accidents due to mismanagement, such as pedal steps.
The number of cases in which the number of accidents occurred (2015 Police Agency data) is more than 1080, more than 24 years old, and more than 1032 cases over 75 years.
It is important that young people take care of the same things as young people.
Do you take the Oshale of the foot?
Do you take safety?
This data does not include male and female ratios or causes, but unlike elderly people who think it is often due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflective nerves, it is possible that young people are concerned with other things such as music and conversation, and mistakes made due to clothing, etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the dress of the day, such as high heels, panps, sandals, and mulls, and sometimes run as usual.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but it is troublesome to change clothes, but there are many people who are driving without any idea of the possibility of danger.
However, driving in high heels and sandals is akin to road traffic.
One is to ensure that the handle, brake and other operations are operated reliably, and Article 70 stipulates that the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm people.
The other is Article 71, which states that drivers must comply with the requirements set forth by each prefectural public safety committee, and for example, in accordance with the enforcement of the Miyazaki Road Traffic Act, Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, "There is no need to wear footwear in a manner that prevents the operation of the vehicle (except for light vehicles).
The purpose of each prefecture is to be considered a violation of the operation of a footwear that may prevent operation, even if it is not specified as a high heels.
In the high heels, why is driving dangerous?
It's obvious if you think about the basics for safely pedaling.
For a secure pedal operation, the feet are fixed to the floor, and the feet are placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilting the leg right as a point.
At this time, it is important to keep it firmly in place, regardless of the behavior of the cock.
However, in the high heels, the area where the ark is grounded on the floor is small, and always the grads and blows, and because the heel heights have an angle to the entire foot, the area of the scaffolding on the pedal is also small, and the fine adjustment is difficult.
This could lead to danger.
Also, most cars have a floor carpet, but this material can be easily pulled by a high heels, and the heels can not pull the pedals at the time of a steep brake, and the heels are pulled off and the heels are pulled away.
In addition, there are cases where the heels are pulled on the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

"The first day of the performance"

Nishida says, "I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to go, but I'm drunk, but I'm drunk?"I was impressed by the fact that I'm not really an intoxicated person, and invited a laugh at the venue.
Nishida, who grew up with a good team work, said, "If you have a reputation, you might become a series."I would like to borrow your power and work hard for the series," and I also expressed my willingness to work for the series, and I was sorry because Nishida was listening to the film.

"The beauty and evil" is the paper weight?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps the beautiful girls of the work? - Yahoo!
The expression of a mysterious beauty and a shadow is in common.
Starting in the 1950s, a number of works were sent to the world, and a series of works were introduced in August 2019 (George Koshi) to focus on the beautiful girls that Dr. Yusuke's painting, known as the first person in the "Fear Manga".
If you look at it in your hand, you will be aware of the correlation between "mi" and "for fear" of your work.
[Image] It is attractive because there is a shadow?
The beautiful girl of the work (5 pieces)
In the preface to The Beauty Girl Collection, there was a sentence that "There is a sense of fear, uglyness, the shocking scene and unfolding of the story," but the beautiful face changes to the expression of distortion and resentment.
There is a keyword "shou" for those who appear in many works, but there are people who see snakes as "uncleiful living things" or "beautiful" by people who see them.
There are people who like reptiles in the world, and some people don't have to worry about them.
In this way, depending on the person's senses, "mi" and "ugly evil" may be "shouettes".
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a living creature with high spiritual strength since ancient times, and the house where the "white snake" lived is also well-connected.
The work is based on the theme of the "Seep" and there is a series of "Mama-Mama-san!" in 1965 and "The Girl of the Sun."
The most important thing is that a woman with a shadow is a woman.
Is it a good way to say "Courtivation" type?.....I feel that it's like the commonities of beautiful girls appearing in the picture.
In particular, since 1969, the protagonist of the "Nakachi", which was serialized in the Weekly Juvenile Sunday, is a beautiful girl character, which is representative of the picture works, but it reminds me of a snake, such as a deep sleep every hundred years to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, and a part with magical power.

Yamamoto entered the prefecture on February 26 to explain the results of the accident caused by the AH64D combat helicopter crash in Kanagawa Prefecture.
On the same day, I went to Saga Prefecture on a business trip.
I posted comments, such as "I'm delicious", along with photos of Mr. Kazuna Iwata, who was elected to the prefecture for the meal.

[Etsuzan Wakamizu] A circle of "Children't Cafeteria" that provides free or inexpensive meals for children is spreading nationwide.
According to surveys conducted by NPOs and others, about 3700 activities are conducted throughout Japan this year.
Compared to 2018, it increased by one or six times, and in Fukui Prefecture, it was 24 years ago.
Why is it a children's canteen?
Mr. Yuasa, President of NPO Corporation and social activist, talked about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate, the area became lonely and the shopping street declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So, "There was a need for an exchange base in the area where people and people were living together."
As a children's cafeteria, it is a "multi-generation exchange place" where elderly people participate.
Not only do you eliminate a single meal, but also lead to support for raising and raising the health of the elderly.
Cut off the chain of poverty and make the region energetic.
What is important is "Don't make a child that's coming from there."
There are a wide variety of places to offer meals every day from the 1st month.
The venue is diverse from private houses to temples.
The atmosphere is becoming possible for people who want to do.
The low quality of such a rug is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
Challenges such as a safe management system can also be heard.
However, Yuasa says, "By engaging with many people, the value will change," and "The connection with society will become a safety net in the case of disasters."
It seems to be the light of hope for a closed society.

"The Iranian drone "Abbabilic" used in the bombing has been dramatically improved by analyzing a crashed US drone in recent years.
It can be manufactured at a low price, and its range is about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to get caught by the radar because it flies low skies."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization "Fushi" in Yemen has issued a statement of crime.
"There's no mistake behind the Fushisian: it's wrong to say that Iran, led by President Rohani, is a country that cannot export crude oil.I cannot accept that Saudi Arabia is making a profit in oil under the circumstances where it cannot export crude oil.
Following the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and the crude oil price rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock will come back.
"I want to avoid any military intervention until at least the next next year's election ends, as Trump has pledged to withdraw US forces from the Middle East, and Iran will continue to bomb drones to hide the Fushiss, but the U.S. will not be able to endure any time," he says.
The U.S. and Iran's "provisional war" is at the forefront of the immediate crisis.

[Photo] The interior of the Lexus LC which stands out for its high quality.
The special specification car was developed based on the idea of "CRAFTED".
CRAFTED is an expression of the desire to create a new experience with a sense of Japanese aesthetics developed in rich nature and history, and an ambiguous object that we seek without words.
LC's special specification car "PATINA Elegance" is based on LC500/LC500h, and uses the highest-level Lexa leather L-ANI LINE sheet and a soft hand leather steering with premium leather leather with a soft touch.
It was finished as a model that further enhanced windiness and taste.
L-ANILINE selects only the highest original skin and achieves its softness with a color coat aiming for a long time of flexibility and a thin coating of its own technology.
It improves the comfort and fit in your body.
The steering wheel also uses premium leather to make it feel high quality.
In addition, metal processing with alkantar Raulof and laser etching was specially equipped with a skaf plate and a color head-up display where the motif overlaps beautifully.
The interior is equipped with a bright cosina brown, door trim, leather sheet and sheet belt.
In addition, the stitch color uses two different colors of light brown and dark brown to express the high quality and depth of the space.
The body color is a three-color setting of Sonic titanium and graphite black glass flakes, including a special specification car-specific setting.

The above image was published on Apple's site in Denmark (now fixed).
The image certainly has the character "From October 4 (Fraden 4. oktober).
If it is a official website, the accuracy of the information is high.
By the way, the most common feature I personally want to try is "Sidecar".
This is a feature that handles iPads as a sub-displacement of Mac, and is a feature that was previously implemented in the Third App.
And Sidecar is Apple's pure feature, so it is expected that it is better at more completion (and response).
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro equipped with a 16-inch display, but I would like to experience this next generation macOS.

[The first half of the Bud World Race] The world's champion, Yoshitoo Momota, and the successful Zhou Tensei, lead one step!
< Men's Singles < (Bad x Spirit).
The Japan national team that won six medals at the Badminton Big Event held in August, the 25th World Championship (Swisss Basel) will be held in early September.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the race from May to August, the next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the mid-September (September to December).
The Badminton Olympic race, which began in May, digested the top four Super 500 and more, when the world championship was finished.
In the first half of the competition, he was the second winner of the 4th tournament, the second winner of the tournament, and the second one from Shutensei, Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship, and Shutensei is the Indonesia Open (S1000) and the world ranking point that is directly connected to the Olympic race.
In addition, Momota also holds the JapanOP (S750).
In May, the Sdirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia Open (July 16 strong), the Japan Open (July) and the World Championship (August).
Compared to other top players, there are a few schedules, which have reduced the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship event was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the war.
A good result is required in the middle of the middle race, which is the highest level since September.
Ace of Taiwan strong in the series.
It's also a lot of attention to young Thai people!
He also won the Indonesia Open and Thailand Open (S500), and has already played in seven tournaments.
He also participated in the local Taipei OOP (S300) in September and won the event.
Originally a fizzal, a player who does not suffer from a series of battles.
Even if the contest continues, there is no big problem with the performance of the match.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming Games by winning high points in the first half.
It was the impression that Shutensei had a lack of explosive power until last year, but this year the stableness of the play increased so that he could continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's first ranking, it seems to have been a tough opponent than ever.
In addition to the two players, the results were left in the first half of the race, with the young Thai ace Kantafone and the Indian Sai Planey B.
He is the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who is struggling with the forces of Europe.
Kantafone is not able to enter the finals at the top, but he has the ability to win the top four times in the second quarter.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18-year-old) who was able to rally against the top players is quite likely to leap in the Olympic race.
In addition, Sai Planeys B. took a step away in India, where a single-storied player is available.
Samir Balama, Planey H.S., and Srikans Kidamba, who is late in Kega, are also driving forward, so it is necessary to pay attention to India after the middle war.
New toll on mobile phone prices in fair competition: Hokkaido newspaper
Revision of the Telecommunications Business Act in October A new toll plan for mobile phone companies was introduced.
However, it was generally high.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for a decline of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for a decline in prices, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full entry into Leshan is ahead, and the state of the three major companies continues to exist.
For consumers, fair competition is a good way to use the system.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount of terminal and communication fees.
Instead of cheaply selling the terminal, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the terminal half-priced.
However, both companies have a system for "SIM Lock" which cannot be used for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will increase the number of subscribers to the maximum of one-third.
Both companies continue to "close" to prevent transfer to other companies.
Regarding SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy to require immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten was due to the development of communication networks, such as the base station, as planned.
It was only expected to be a trigger for a downtrend competition, so it was a fashionable shoulder.
Maybe there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start of the full-scale service and the fees are not revealed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we want to work with responsibility.
The revision of the rate was made possible by Mr. Suga.
Mr. Kan expressed his dissatisfaction with the three new charges, "I think the competition will start now, and I don't think it's good at all."
However, the decline in government value does not seem to affect the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should expand its customer-oriented competition before it comes out from the government.
The pricing system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Agency called for attention as there is a case where the consumer's burden is more than half the amount, while the device has a "maximum" advertising.
We must try to explain polite and easy to understand, so that companies do not make mistakes.

Rugby World Cup - Yohao! News
The U.S. FL Quill is a rough play, and the former English representative is "not a tack".
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was held on 26th, the last time in 20 countries, the U.S. was defeated in 7-45 in England.
It was the start of the black star, but the rough play played by FL John Quill was called a ripple.
In the form of adding a shoulder tack to the face of the opponent, one exit.
The actual scene is also shown in a video with foreign media, and the former English nationals are struggling to say that they are "a shameful and unsubscribed play" and "not a tack".
[Video] "The play of insults and cowards" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of the " face-to-face danger tack" played by U.S. Representative Kiel.
The hot fighting spirit crossed the line.
It is 29 minutes after the reception at 0-38.
It was a bit of a balance when the falrel of the Lord of England caught the path of the enemy.
I went to Tuckle to do that.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower part of the waist and hit the upper half.
As a result, the opponent's head and head are in contact and shaped like a head.
Farrell was blown up violently and fell.
In a play that obviously lacks legitimacy, the English players have a fierce protest against the Quill.
The two military players gathered together at once, and the air immediately began.
The result of the TMO (video decision) is that Quill is going to a red card.
After the pitch on the bad face, some of the audience asked for a fair play.
Rugby's Strong Australia New Zealand's local media "Clubs" will feature the headlines "Bill W Cup 2019: The U.S. players will get out of play and the English will win".
"Kill has done a modest shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and has gone out," he reports, "It has become a struggle by almost two military players."
The article introduces the comments of former English national and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult and a coward.It's not called a tack, it's a pesimistic play," he said.
The U.S., which lacked one person, managed to complete the game with an 81-minute trial.
However, Kiel's play left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the 424 hospital's name for the first time that it was judged to be "a poor track record of treatment" among 1455 public hospitals and Japanese hospitals.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public hospitals and public hospital facilities, and four facilities were included in the National Hospital Organization of Awa straw Hospital in the city.
⇒ The four hospitals for reorganisation are "standard".
In order to reduce the medical costs that are expanding due to the aging population, it is necessary to promote the restructuring and integration of hospitals in the conflict area.
In October, I would like to ask for a full-fledged review of the reorganization and integration of the hospital and give a conclusion by September next year.
There is no force to force, but there is an expectation of local mayors and residents' repulsion due to anxiety that a nearby hospital will no longer be.
The meeting was held on the same day.
The hospital had a total of 29.1%, and there were many hospitals with relatively few beds.
In prefectures, Niigata (53, 7 %) was a prefecture, Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47,5 percent) and Yamaguchi (46,7 %) and Okayama (43 and 3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and only zero in Okinawa.
Based on the data in FY2017, the Ministry of Health and Welfare investigates 1455 hospitals that respond to "acute periods" for severe patients, and "acute periods" for general surgery.
The results of the 9 items such as cancer and emergency medical care, as well as the analysis of whether a competing hospital is located within 20 minutes' drive, judged the necessity of publicizing the hospital name.
In the hospital you are eligible to consider the abolition and the transfer of some clinics to other hospitals.
The medical care costs are rapid in 25 years, when all of the mass generation are over 75 years old.
For this reason, the ministry aims to reduce the number of hospital beds to 119,11,000 beds in 124,66,000 beds in Japan.
Currently, there are a lot of beds for "acute periods" and "acute periods" where nurses are placed thickly, but the need for elderly people is lacking in rehabilitation.
In order to respond to the aging population, it is necessary not only to simply reduce the number of beds, but to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has formulated a regional medical concept that sets the number of beds required for 25 years.
While the country is divided into 339 districts, municipalities and healthcare officials are discussing, many of the local residents and the chiefs maintain a cautious attitude, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Labor wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.

Recommended area for pork cholera vaccine 9 provinces of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Gifu Shimbun Web - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a proposal to amend the quarantine guidelines to allow preventive vaccination against unrecognised cartilage pigs in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as pigs.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have confirmed infection in pigs and wild Inoshi.
Vaccinated living pigs and fertilized eggs are restricted to the region, but distribution of sperm and processed products is accepted.
Through public comments (requestion) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedures in October.
By using vaccines and recognizing the distribution of meat and other regions, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations, and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan had a temporary pending status as a clean country.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set up a "probation recommended area" based on expert opinions about areas with high risk of infection from wild Inoshi to pigs.
The target prefecture has created a Vaccination Program, which summarizes the scope and duration of vaccination, the number of heads, and how to proceed.
The other seven prefectures are listed as recommended regional proposals for vaccination: Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the guideline is revised, the region will decide again.
The movement of the inoculated pork, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excreted objects is limited to the region in principle.
Regarding meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restriction and the impact of farmers, and virtually accepts distribution outside the region.
The processing of food waste is thoroughly done because it does not spread viruses.
We call on the safety of the inoculated pork and address the prevention of damage.
The proposed amendment of the Guidelines was summarized at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Effective Headquarters.
In the future, the Government will hold a hearing and public comments to the prefecture until October 7 and implement a new anti-inflammatory guideline.
A public approach to Man U!
"Don't need money" - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 Delivery
As far as last season, I left the Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and the former Japanese national representative, Mr. Motoda, who is currently unaffiliated, made an amazing act.
[Video] Kei Honta, I was actually in the game.
The truth of heaven is revealed.
Japan Time 27 Late at midnight Honda has made a public approach to a club, saying, "Please give your own Twitter offer: Money is not necessary, but you need to play with great teams and great runners."
The other person who sent the "inverse offer" was the world famous Manchester United.
Why did Honda have a magnificent request for the most powerful Australian clubs in the Premier League?
The reason for this is the Australian version of FOX Sports, which was published on 24th.
In the article entitled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could grab in the danger of injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfried Bonnie, there was also the name of Honda.
Now in the United, there have been injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Mart, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Ole Gunner SurSharr, is forced to lose 2 wins and 22 losses in the league, and challenges the quality of the front.
It was Honda that the Australian media named it as a new force candidate for Teco.
In the article, Mr. Honda's contract as a creative side, not a Striker, is analyzed to fill the holes that Andreas Pereira is buried.
The score of 9 out of 18 matches in the Melbourne Victory is "a solid record", but "The 33-year-old Honda needs to take full attention from his entertainment to manage Cambodian representatives."
What does the Honda approach mean?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward due to the success of the next Tokyo Olympics.

A representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want to connect to the development of new foreign customers while the operating environment is severe."
Now, Ikemura, a well-known Dora, does not need to improve the first shot.
Today's best shot
The 1W shot is not necessarily up and hit.
There is also the so-called "Dora" technique that you want to make a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance through the second hit of Part 5.
Recently, the 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of the balls being scattered, but there are also players who practice this often on the ground.
The tour is the first time Ikemura was able to win.
Pro The 24th year of the 7th year is 166 cm in height and is currently 7th in the driving force field (average 30.02yd).
While I was good at long shots, one of the challenges was fairwaywood's accuracy.
At the beginning of spring, "I thought I would try to do the dod directly because the spoon (3W) shot was a dummy."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball onto the grass in the area, and even shake 1W.
In cases where big carry is required, a lot of Ti-Ups are required, but both sides are effectively used in small holes.
"I can use it in the hall where the eye line is lifted."
In the ballistic measuring device, he recorded 270yd to 280 yd.
"That's why I don't have 3W, so I can't worry about it anymore.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, only 1W of Wood in the Caddy Bag.
The second longest club is loft 17 degrees.
The battle method, which surprises the tour associates, is also a pleasure to hear the feeling of leaking from the gallery.
Kotz says, "I want to change the club to level."
"Even if you hit the lower blow, you won't fly straight, it's a cut track, right, it's a cut track, and you've been doing a rectifier to correct the 1W shot's swing," he says.
The ball is not caught and the risk of the slice is accompanied by "So the left side can be erased (not bent on the left).
I say to Kantan, but it's a professional technique that I can't imagine.

On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do the adults use time to laugh and intimidate teenagers and children?"
"I will come up with my thoughts as long as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
Greta said, "I started again, as I was concerned, those who disliked me are still active.My appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and what I am different from others, they start to post as long as you can think about lies and conspiracy theories."
And because they don't want to deal with the climate and environmental crisis, they pointed out that they seem to have a point of discussion.
Why don't you understand why the adults use time to laugh and intimidate teens and children?
That time would be another good.
I think they will feel threatened with us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.

On 22nd, the final round was held at the Bear's Best Cheongna Golf Club (7238 Yards per 71) in South Korea, followed by a 1 Eagle, 2 Bardi and 1 Boggy's 68.
[Video] Come to Japan!
Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to extend to the first half, so I thought I could go through that momentum in the second half, but I couldn't help but stretch it, so I was sorry.
I saw the 6th Eagle, the 7th Bardy win?
Even after hitting Boggy in fourth place, there was still a 5 per person, so when I was doing it, the chip in Eagle came in sixth.
Even in the seventh place, Bardy was captured and made a chance, but after the second half I was regrettable that I could not extend.
– What did you get in the contest now?
Since the sound of the shot was not good, it was nice to have a fairway in a narrow course.
Raf was a course that changed the distance between the eyes and the back, so I had no experience, so I learned quite well.
What is the difference between the regular events?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I had a lot of videos and pictures in the gallery.
There were not many other changes, but because there were only a few Japanese players co-hosted the tournament, I took part in the match with the feeling of "not losing to foreign players".
The second half of the race will continue, but if you don't win more than one win, you don't want to target the winning king, so you'll want to win another, so there is also a ZOZO Championship, so you'll try to catch up with the top level in the upcoming Games.
What is the way to prevent dementia from becoming "continued"?
Interviews and sentences / Yosuke Watanabe
A drug of dementia that is frustrated by the challenges faced by major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated, and it has been shown that it is possible to keep it extremely mild and forgotten.
I was told by Professor Toshiyuki Ogi University Hospital, Center for Brain Research.
No dementia is not.
How is the current situation? - The prevention and treatment of dementia are awaited.
Depending on the degree of difference, from Otsuki mild to severe, it is possible for everyone to become dementia when they age.
However, it is believed that new dementia drugs will still take more than 20 years to develop.
The drug called Donepezil, which is widely used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and the outstanding cure effect is not expected.
On the other hand, the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have also been declining due to the remarkable progress in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem with the person or family, but it is necessary to create an environment where people can live with peace of mind throughout society.
How to keep things to "I forget"
– Is there someone who is easy to get dementia and difficult to become?
Even if it is unavoidable to become Otsuki dementia, there is a possibility that you can reduce the symptoms as much as you can and keep them to the extent that you forget things.
Dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be easier.
First, the metabolites tend to become dementia.
Dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
The existence of economic power also affects.
For example, in the United States, there are regions that distribute food tickets to the poor, but food that can be served with food tickets is frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
No gas or electricity can be used, and people living in an environment where they can't cook.
Then, it becomes a meal with little vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life of fat and sugar.
Eventually, poverty becomes obese, and when you do it, you can only see the TV, and your body becomes impatient.
A similar situation may be in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books from day to day.
