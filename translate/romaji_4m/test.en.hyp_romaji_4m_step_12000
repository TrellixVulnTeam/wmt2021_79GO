Driving in a heel is dangerous!
Don't miss a young man's pedal (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
A violation of the Act on Traffic Traffic Traffic Control
Although self-porting reports by mistake such as pedals have increased, it's a big mistake that I think it's only a problem with the elderly driver.
The number of self-promising incidents in the past (2015 Police Agency data) is the most frequent age of 1080, which is over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
Can you take your feet' fashion?
Are you taking safety?
Although there is no mention of gender or cause, there are many differences between elderly people who think that driving skills and reflection nervousness can be attributed to physical decline, and young people are taken care of other things such as music and conversation in young age, and some mistakes are considered.
There are some people who choose and run various shoes by wearing high heel, pans, sandals, mults, that day's clothing.
There are some people who know they don't want to drive, but some people don't think that they may lead to danger, and there are many people who are driving without difficulty.
However, driving in a heel or a sandal will be suspended in the traffic law.
One is to ensure that the handle, brake and other operations are performed, and "Do not drive the accident and harm the person" (the violation of the Safety Driving obligations).
Another thing is that the driver must comply with the provisions set forth by the Nuclear and Dofuken Public Security Committee, for example, in Article 1 of the Act on the Road Traffic Control Act of Miyazaki Prefecture, it is not possible to use a vehicle (except for a vehicle) that is not allowed to carry out operation.
It is similar to that each and the dojob is not specified as a heel, but also to violate the operation of the "hakimono that can hinder operation."
Then, why is the risk of driving in a heel?
It is clear if you think of the basics on the pedal securely.
In order to operate a safe, realistic pedal, the first step is fixed on the floor and the brake pedal is vertical, and when you take a accelerator pedal, the foot is right as a point of view.
At this time, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the behavior of the car does not break.
However, in the heel, the area of the heel is small, and it is always gratified, and the angle is attached to the whole foot at the height of the heel, so that the area of the foot placed on the pedal is not small, and the fine adjustment is difficult.
This is thought to lead to danger.
Although most of the cars have floor carpets, it is easy to take advantage of this material, and when it comes to brake, it is not necessary to take a pedal, and it cannot be sewed on the cover, and it cannot be attached to the top of the pedal.
In addition, when you take the pedal back, there is a case that the elbows are attached to the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedals did not return.

Kinki ceramics produced in the magnetic field industry of Hyogo and Awaji Awajiwara are Jun self-sufficient and approximately 20 billion yen (the Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
The decline in housing prices and repeated earthquake damage caused by the earthquake and the effects of the decline in consumer tile roofs.
Kinki Ceramics (TDB's Code: 530173983, capital 9920 million yen, Awaji Awaji Awaji , 81-8, representative Fukuhara Yasukura, 44 employees) applied for the accident to Kobe City on August 30.
The new representative is Yoshida Chichi (Kitachi City, Osaka Prefecture) 1-10-8 Nishi Tenma 1-10-8, Yoshida plateau law firm, telephone 06-63-6038 and one person.
The company was founded in June 1895 (Meiji 28), and in 1961 (Showa 36) was reorganized as a corporation.
Initially, in the title of Kinki's Co., Ltd., the company started its business as a manufacturer of Ubushigawa River, a magnetic industry in Awaji , in the Nishi Tancho (now Minami Awaji City).
At the same time, when Kyushu Co., Ltd. was absorbed by the Kogyo Co., Ltd. in October86, the Kinki Industrial Co., Ltd. was moved to the current location.
After that, I opened a sales base in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Oita Prefecture, and Miyazaki City, and I was involved in the current system.However, due to the change of consumer needs, Hirowara Kawara, etc., was produced at a rate of 70%.
With a wide range of operating boards, such as major house manufacturers, materials manufacturers, and roof construction companies, the company's annual net sales of around 3116 million yen in December 2004.
I had a reputation as a top tile manufacturer in Awajishima.
However, due to the decline in housing prices since the Lehman Shock, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand continued to rise due to repeated earthquake damage.
In addition to the decline in profit rate associated with the rise in fuel prices, the profit rate was forced to hit a continuous deficit with excessive interest liabilities associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment.
For this reason, although I was trying to re-examine the management by asking for the repayment conditions of borrowing money to the financial institutions, I had no signs of recovery today.
We gave up the continued support of the business and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to reach around 20 billion yen.

"Avabeer" used in this bombing has dramatically improved performance by analyzing the drone of the U.S. military that crashed in recent years.
It can be manufactured cheap, and the subsequent distance is around 1000 km.
It is also a strength that is difficult to catch up with radars in order to fly the tails."
On September 14, Saudi Aramiko, the largest oil company in Saudi Arabia, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization of Yemen, Fushi, has announced the declaration of life.
"The reason behind the Fushi is that Iran, led by President Rohani, does not permit hostile Saudi Arabia to be established in crude oil in the circumstances where the country cannot export crude oil.If you continue to take a measure of crude oil against Iran, you will be aware of the pain associated with the pain and the international community."
After the bombing, half of the total oil production in Saudi Arabia stopped, and the crude oil price recorded 15%.
In this case, there is a voice in which oil shocks are reluctant.
"I would like to avoid any military intervention until Trump's withdrawal from the Middle East and at least next year's elections have ended, and Iran will continue to bomb the drone in the hideout.However, the U.S. will not be able to endure the attack on Iran.

YouTuber, who has a great popularity especially for young people.
There is also a case where companies are used to use ads for their products, but there are companies that have started to use YouTuber as their employees.
The company's CRM "Customer Relationship Management" is a direct marketing mix (hereinafter DmMiX), which is the main business.
What is the "to adopt YouTuber"?
Mr. Kobayashi, president of DmMiX, gave me a talk to Mr. Yusuke Kobayashi, who is actually a member of the subsidiary and staff of YouTuber.
We want to support young people with YouTuber adoption.
What kind of mechanism is the YouTuber adoption?
Kobayashi Yusuke (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): Now, YouTuber's career has become a long-standing youth.
Elementary school students are at the top level in their career rankings, and young people who want to become more and more will continue to grow.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have dreamed of bandman and comedy performers.
Just like that, I'm using a young man who's dreaming of becoming a YouTuber, and I'm using YouTuber.
What is YouTuber? - YouTuber There is a picture that a person is going to post videos independently, but why did you think that you want to adopt it?
Kobayashi: While many young people are eager to work with YouTuber, most of the YouTubers have a reality that they don't get revenue like they thought.
There are few creators who have been making video and posting while working as a part-time job, and creators who can't admit the existence of YouTuber to their family.
In this effort, we will provide the environment for salaries and content creation to creators who have adopted.
The first thing I think is that we support our activities by helping us with the benefits of the occupation of YouTuber, which becomes unstable.

I confirmed about 300 of them in 17 minutes.
During the day, the traditional knowledge of Sakura shrimp in the deep sea was once again backed by "the ocean has formed a cluster of some degree."
The body is about 40 millimeters in length, and the individual who was moved is around 23 millimeters.
They identified different data from the season of the cherries and scattered eggs.
More detailed analysis will ask you to the Fujitsu Software Technology Chart and the Shizuoka Industrial Technology Center School.
Yusuke's project leader in the water said, "I would like to take the appearance of a person living in a growing family, including shrimp."

4 Today decision: Hokkaido Newspaper
The sixth All-Go Championship (sponsored by Hokkaido Newspapers) began on 28th, at a Hokkaido newspaper in Chuo-ku, Sapporo.
30 people participated in the competition to compete at the top level of amateurs in the field, and the best four were all over.
In the semifinals, I went to the early morning's Sanzeni (48) = Sapporo District =, Takuma Hideyuki (52) =, and Takumi (72) = Asahikawa District =, Takahatsushu (75) = Kitami district =.
In the quarter-finals of the previous year's high-night Kazuya (49), he won the highest prize in the tournament.
Mr. Yuya (8), who participated in the market signs of the tournament, lost his first victory in the previous year's first match, Kazutoyo (75) to Chihiro-ku.
Mr. Arai was defeated by two lines.
29th day is the semifinals of the entire road from 11:30 pm to the finals.
From 10:00 a.m., the 6th All Road Joryugo Championship will be held.

(The first race of the Baddo Olympic race) The world champion, Momota, and the principal's state-of-the-shelf race!
Men's singles "Bad ×spice!
Six medals at the 25th World Championships in Switzerland and the 25th World Championships, held in August, Japan's national team will be participating in the China OP (Nuzhou / Super1000), which will be held from September 17.
Looking back on the first race from May to August, the Olympic race that took place at the Tokyo Olympic Games next year, we will see the men's singles for the Mid-Autumn Festival from September to December.
The Badminton Olympic race, which began in May, was held at the time of the World Championships, when the top players took part in the top tournament (Super 500 or more).
In the first half of the race, I kept the principal with Momota, who won the 2nd prize in the 4th tournament, and two people in Taiwan's Zhou Tenshin Chen.
Momota won the World Championships, Zhou Tensei, Indonesia OP (S1000) and the high point of "World Ranking Point" that directs the Olympic race.
In addition, Momota is also a Japanese OP (S750).
The tournament has been held since May at the S dillman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July 16), JapanOP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of players compared to other top players is less, it is a schedule that suppresses the burden on the body.
August was only one tournament in the World Championships, but it would not be bigger than the time of the race.
The results of the mid-term events that will be held after September are required.
Ace of Taiwan who is strong in the line.
I'm also attracted by young people in Thailand!
In the same way, the winning streak of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500) played in the top tournament was already in seven tournaments.
He also participated in the 9-month-old Taipei OP (S300), and played a fantastic win.
Originally, the physical is strong, and the players in the country do not want to play.
Even if the tournament continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament that will play in the future by earning high points in the first half.
It was an impression that the state-of-the-counter explosions were over the last year, but the stability of the player was increasing in this year.
For Momota, the world's top ranked number one, it seems to be more than ever.
In addition to these two players, I left the results in the first half line, but the Thai young Ace Kanta font India's Sai Plannies B...
And he is three players in the Unders Antonen, who is a child in Europe.
Kantaphon has not been able to reach the finals at the top level, but in the second season, he has been in the top position, such as entering the best 4th place.
Although there is still a rough side, it seems that the rally with the top players and the emergence of the 20-year-old (21-year-old) is likely to leap into the Olympic race.
In addition, Sai Plannies B. took a step away in India, where you can pick up a single player.
Samir Rosema, Pranoi H.S., and the sliccans kimbubi, which has been delayed by kega, is also coming up, and it requires attention to India after mid-stage.
Concluding in a fair competition: Hokkaido Newspaper
Revision of the Telecommunications Business Act in October The new cost plan of a mobile phone company associated with the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it was almost stopped.
He said that the Secretary-General of the Han Wei Dynasty said that there was a room lower than 40%, and despite the expectation of lower prices, prices did not fall.
The full-scale entry of Rakuten is a major factor, and the state of the three major rivers continued.
Due to fair competition for consumers, it is desirable to be a cost structure that is easy to use.
I would like to seek the efforts of mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits the set discounts for the terminal and the communication amount.
Instead of having a terminal or a few minutes, it was because the amount of communication was increased.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced the plan to make the terminal a half-price.
However, the "SIM Rock" which cannot be used by other companies for 100 days is the mechanism for the device.
NTT DOCOMO will be the largest number of terminals for only the subscribers of their own line.
The three companies would like to continue their "exhaustion" to prevent the transfer to other companies.
For the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications expressed the policy that the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is obliged to cancel immediately.
Companies must also respond promptly.
The postponement of Rakuten did not proceed as planned, such as the base station.
The only thing that was expected to be a burgeoning competition was that it was a kind of cute.
It was a sweet taste of the outlook.
There is no indication of the start date and rate of full-fledged services.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on the business.
The price of this time was expressed by the Secretary-General of Japan.
Mr. Kan expressed his dissatisfaction with the three new charges: "I think that the competition will start here, and I don't think it's good."
However, I don't think that "completeness" is a way to market and encourage sound competition.
Before the corporate side is out of the government, it is necessary to develop a customer's competition.
The cost structure of each company is very complicated and the comparison is not easy.
The consumer's attention was given as a case where the consumer's burden exceeds half of the amount of money.
It must be a polite and easy-to-understand explanation, so that companies don't listen to their mistakes.

"G Rugby W Cup" More than a single-shot & Rantou U.S. players "The face-risk tackle" - Yahoo!
The United States FLkuru played a rough play, the former representative of England (not called a tackle).
Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan's Rugby World Cup (W Cup) The final appearance in 20 countries was a toast in England 7-45.
Although it became a black frog, it was later called a rough play played by the FLJohn Kuru.
More than one shot in the face of the opponent's face.
The actual scene has also been released with foreign media, and the former England representative players have stopped the phrase "no insults and fierce play" (not called a tackle).
(video) "I'm an insulting and fierce player" and the overseas gate!
More than a single shot, the homologous that both military players get in...The real moment of the "face dangerous tackle" played by the US representative Kuru.
The hot investment crossed the line.
It's a 29-minute walk from 0-38.
The enemy deeply fell somewhat in balance when the British Prime Minister Farrell catches the path of view.
I went to tackle this, but it was a clump.
However, it does not occur under the waist, and the body is very severe in the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with the shape of each other.
Farrell was severely beaten and fell.
In fact, he took a lecture as a monk with an English player in the play he wrote.
Both players gathered at once, and they became the first air.
As a result of TMO's "video judgment", the pile is more than a single red card.
Although the punishment was bad, after pitching on the face, some people were asked to play the fair.
Rugby Competition New Zealand's local media "staffs" are featured in the Rugby World Cup 2019: The United States players beat the headlines with a fierce play, and England was renamed.
"Kill has made a fierce s holders charge in the face of the British Star Player Farrell, and became more" (maybe by both players).
In the article, I would like to introduce the comments of Mr. Ogo Montya of the former England representative player.
"It's an insult, and it's not called a tackle.It's a fierce play," he said.
The United States bought one game, and the United States managed to escape the beats in the preliminary round of maintenance for 81 minutes.
However, the play of the pile has left the bad side.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced on September 26 that the hospital's name for the 424 was "disputed with poor medical results" from public hospitals such as 1455 Public Hospitals and Niseki.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Public Hospital 14 confirmed the achievements of the treatment of the 14 facilities, and the National Hospital of the University of Tsukuba The National Hospital of the Churawara City Hospital Textiles in Echizen-Cho of Oda Hospital The four facilities were targeted.
⇒ 4 Hospitals (standard funny) for the reorganization
In order to suppress the medical costs that can be expanded by an aging age, we had to encourage the reorganization and integration of hospitals in the conflict areas.
I would like to ask for a full-fledged review of the reorganization and integration of the target hospital in October and conclude it by September.
There is no forced force, but due to anxiety when a short hospital is gone, local claims and repulsion can be expected.
It was announced at the meeting of the same day.
There were a lot of hospitals in which the number of beds was relatively small, compared to 29.1 percent.
In the prefecture, the ratio was high in terms of Niigata (53,7 %), Hokkaido (48,6 %), Miyagi (47,5 %), Yamaguchi (46,7 %) and Okayama (43,3 %).
The total number of seats in Hokkaido was 54, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on the data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health and Public Health investigated 1455 hospitals that can respond to severe patients' "element acute" and a common surgery.
We analyzed the medical achievements of nine items such as gas and emergency, and the need for hospital names to determine whether a conflict hospital is within 20 minutes by car.
In the targeted hospital, you will be able to consider the abolition and some medical treatment to other hospitals.
The medical costs surged in the past 25 years, when all members of the first generation are over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health has set a goal to reduce the number of beds at a hospital in 18 years to 19.1 thousand floor.
Although there are a number of beds in the "Advanced acute" and "suppressive age" and "suppressive age", the number of elderly patients has been missing.
In order to respond to aging, you simply need to reduce the number of beds, but also increase your rehabilitation.
In response to the reorganization and integration of the hospital, the concept of "regional medical care" was established by each and the Dofuken in 25 years.
Although it is divided into 339 prefectures, municipalities and medical officials, many of the local residents and claims have maintained their cautious posture, and discussions are inconvenient.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan intends to activate the debate by announcing the name of a hospital with poor performance.

These vaccines are recommended for the recommended areas of the disease - Yahoo!
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issued an amendment to the Trade Guidelines that allow vaccination to the currently not permitted use pigs to prevent the spread of livestock infection (buttons).
The target area is a policy to select nine prefectures such as Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which is confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boar.
The movements such as the breathed pig and fertilized eggs are limited in the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments (subscriptions) to the general public, I would like to complete the procedures in October as soon as possible.
The use of vaccines and the recognition of the widespread distribution of meat, such as meat, may result in a "normal country" that was certified by the international community and affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan's status of normal countries was temporarily suspended.
Under the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has set the " vaccination recommended area" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The prefectures of the prefecture will create a " vaccination program" that summarizes the range of intake, time, head position, etc., and permit use in the Governor's judgment.
The other seven prefectures that are rising as a recommended region are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the region is revised, the situation will be determined again.
The movements such as the ingested pig, semen, fertilization, the body, and acet are restricted to the region in principle.
In terms of the cost and effects of distribution restrictions and the effect of farmers, the distribution of meat and processed products is not subject to the effect of the distribution restrictions.
Since the virus does not spread, it thoroughly processes food waste.
In response to the safety of the pig that was ingested, we will also address the prevention of adverse effects.
The amendment of the Guidelines was summarized at the Expert Meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the Meeting of the Trade Countermeasures Headquarters.
In the future, we will introduce opinions to the prefecture and hold public comments until October 7 and consider a new trade guideline.
An independent Honda Kei Yu, a public approach to ManU!
(Please do not need money) Football Channel - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
As far as last year, I was interviewed by the Australian A League's Melbourne Bictori, and now I'm going to be surprised by the amazing behavior of the independent MF Honda system.
(Video) Honda Kei Yu, Actually, did you come out of the game?
The truth of the point is revealed.
Honda, who updated his own Twitter at midnight on the 27th of the day, said, "We do not need money, but we need to play with great teams and amazing teammates," he said.
The opponent who sent "the reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world's prestigious Manchester United.
Why did Honda make a grand request for the most competitive club in the Premier League?
The reason is that the article " FOX Sport" published on the 24th of the Australian edition.
"The five FWs that Manchester United has the potential to capture in the equipment of the injured person" In the article, five independent players who are currently available were picked up.
There was also a name of Honda among players such as Endem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfrede.
At present, the United injured such as the MF Paul Pogbas, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Belli, FWanney Maral, FW Anton Marcus Rushford and others in an emergency situation.
The "Red Devil" led by Ore Guerre Gunar led by Ore Gunner Surusha is forced to take two wins and 22 wins in the league line and challenges the quality of the front line.
Thus, it was Honda that Australia Media was named as a fresh candidate for the Tekokoke.
In the article, Honda's contract as a creative side player is not a strict house bus trier, but it is analyzed that Andreas Pereira is able to fill the holes that are buried.
The 18-game score in Melbourne Victory is a "real record" but the 33-year-old Honda has also pointed out that he needs to take full attention from his entertainment to manage the representative of Cambodia.
Do you have the approach of Honda?
For the next year's Tokyo Olympic Games, we're also looking forward to the United's move because of their goals and careers.

Is it now immediately necessary to make the first appearance of Dr Mingjin Village Hiroshi?
Today's Kadi's best shot shot.
1 W shots are not necessarily low and not lost.
When you want to earn a distance in the second game of Par5, there is a so-called "Dora" skill that you want to take a ball on the ground.
The recent one-W has a large head volume, and the ball is accompanied by the risk of the head, but there are players who often practice it on the ground.
The first victory of the tour is the Ikemura Hiroshi.
The 24th-year-old of Pro7 is a height of 166 cm, while the driving attitude department is currently seventh (average 304.02 yd).
One of the challenges was the Fairwaywood's system.
"The shot of a spoon (3W) was unlucky in the spring, so I would like to try it immediately."
You have to play the balls on the grass in the field from the practice round, and then sprinkle the 1W into the basket.
In the case where Big Carry is required, you can take a variety of Tips, but both sides are effectively used in a narrow hall.
(It is possible to use a hall where the eye is pulled down and becomes a hole).
In ballistic measurements, you can record 270yd to 280 yd in the car.
(So I don't have 3W, so I'm sure that it's better than 3W.)
From the "Japan Tour Championships" in June, Wood is only one W in the cadi bag.
The second longest club is the UT of the loft 17 degrees.
The team who is surprised by the tour buddies is also very happy to hear from the eye-catching gallery.
"It's a good thing to behave at the level of the club."
"Even if you hit the upper part, you can't skip straight.It's just a cut start, and it's just a drag to force the swing of the 1W shots at the time of the start.
If the ball is not caught, it is accompanied by the risk of the slice (so the left side will go out).
It's easy to say, but it's a professional skill.

In Japan, even on the net, there are a lot of things like "I want to go to school" (I think it's better to go to school) and "I don't know what I'm talking about it.
On September 26, Mr. Guterre posted on his Twitter, saying, "Why do adults set up ten youths and children, and how do they spend time in Odosu?"

Then, the adults told me that they don't want to meet the challenges of climate and environmental crisis, but they seemed to have gone on.
Why the adults laugh at 10 young people and children, and spend time in Odosu, or be honest, I can not understand.
It would be a good time for that time.
I think that they're going to believe that they've been threatened with us.
But do not consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
The change has been changing.

Garcia cerebral edge shot shot
I thought that it was in the first half of the time, so I thought it would be possible in the second half, but I thought it was not possible that the poleter could not be performed properly.
Did you see the victory in the 6th Eagle, 7th Bardi?
Even after hitting Boggy at the fourth time, the par 5 was still left, so if I had a feeling of retrieving, I had a chip in the sixth time.
In the 7th edition, Bardi was given a chance to write, but it was a pity that it was not in the late months.
What do you get in the tournament?
Recently (the shot) I didn't have a good mood, so it was good that Fairway was able to keep it in a narrow course.
The rough and the reverse eyes were divided into pieces, and the distance was also changing, so I had a lot of experience because I was studying.
What is the difference between the usual convention?
I think it was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone) camera.
I didn't care at all, but I had a lot of videos at the gallery.
It was a lot different than that, but I just wanted to play a game with a feeling of feeling that I would not lose to overseas players because there are fewer Japanese players in collaboration.
Although I don't get more than one value, I would like to raise my winnings, and I would like to try my best to enter the top position at the ZOZ Champions Championship soon.
Is it a way to prevent becoming a dementia and "get something"?
Interview / interview / interview / Yo Watanabe
One of the major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals has been frustrated by research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been clarified, and it seems that there is a possibility that it can be taken to the extent of inheritance and forget.
Kinki University Hospital The center of the stroke was listening to Prof. Toshisuke Osaki.
There is no dementia.
It's long-awaited for prevention of dementia or treatment, but what is the current situation?
The difference between Okuma's inheritance and severity is that everyone may be aware of age and age.
However, it is believed that new dementia drugs will be developed, but it will still take more than 20 years.
In some countries in Japan, a drug called Donepezilla, which is commonly used in Japan, is already outside the health adaptation and can not expect remarkable sensitivity.
On the other hand, death due to infection and accident has decreased, and cancer deaths have also decreased due to remarkable advances in treatment such as anticancer agents, so that people can be longer.
Therefore, it is true that the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
It is not only possible to resolve the person or family, but it is necessary to prepare the environment to live in a community as a whole.
(To be forgotten) How to do something?
Is it difficult for people to become aware of it?
Even if it cannot be recognized as a diagnosis, it is possible to reduce the symptoms as much as possible (forgetable) to the extent.
The dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle habits and tends to those who are prone to it.
First, the metabolites tend to be prone to dementia.
The dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle habits.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol blood.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there is a region that distributes food tickets to the poor, but the food you receive in the food ticket is hamburg and Pizza Chicken, which can be saved.
Gas and electricity can not be used, and in the first place, people who live in the environment can not cook.
Then, it becomes a meal with vegetables and proteins, and it becomes a life that relies on oil and carbon dioxide.
After all, if you're poor, you're obese, you're not only looking at the TV, but your body will go out.
The same situation can be seen in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things tend to be prone to dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you must think about things that you read books from everyday time.
