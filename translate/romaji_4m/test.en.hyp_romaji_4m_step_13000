Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Auto Mese Web - Yahoo! News
Traffic Law violations
Although the number of accidents is increasing due to pedal mistakes, etc., but I think it is a problem with elderly drivers.
In the past, the number of accident cases (2015 National Police Agency data) has been more than 1032, which is the most common age in the age of 24.
It is important to call attention to the elderly as well as the younger generation.
Can you take your feet fashion?
Do you take safety?
There is no evidence of gender loss or cause, but the difference between elderly people who think that driving skills and reflexive nerves are often caused by the deterioration of the body, and in the younger generation, there is a doubt that music or conversations are taken care of by others.
In particular, some women choose different shoes by wearing high heels, panps, sandals, murmurs, and their daily wear.
Some people know that driving is not a problem, but some people think that it may lead to danger, and many people are driving without bad.
However, driving in high heels and sandals is bound by the traffic law.
One is to ensure that the handle, the brake and other operations are operated, and that "the accident does not cause any damage to the person" Article 70 of the Safety Driving obligation.
In Article 71 of the Policy Committee, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the provisions of the Nuclear Power Policy Committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Road Traffic Control Act, for example, "Turgets, slippers, squeezers, lunge and other driving operations" refers to a vehicle that prevents the operation of a vehicle, excluding driving or driving operations.
It is similar to the intention that the operation of the nuclear power plant will be violated by the "hakimono that may interfere with driving operations".
So why is the driving risk of lung heel?
It is clear if you think about the basics of pedaling safely.
In order to perform safe pedal operation, first place the feet and feet to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then take the accelerator pedal to the right as a viewpoint.
At this time, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the car does not fit.
However, in the heel, the area is small and the area of the floor is always framed, and the angle is attached to the whole foot at the height of the heel, so the area of the foot is not sufficiently small.
This can lead to danger.
In addition, most cars are floor carpets, but this material is easy to get stuck, and when it comes to the brake, the pedals will not take off, and the back of the pedal may be unbearable.
In addition, there is a case that when the pedal goes back to the back side of the pedal, the accelerator pedal was not returned.

Kinki ceramics produced in the magnetic industry of Hyogo and Awaji-shima, "Awaji-gawara" are about 20 billion yen (Electric Data Bank) - Yahoo!
The deterioration of the housing market and the frequent earthquake damage also affected the "converted roof of consumers".
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporate Code: 530173983, capital of 99.2 million yen, capital 992 million yen, 881-8 in Ota City, Hyogo Prefecture, and 44 employees) were requested on August 30 at Kobe Chisai.
The new attorney is Yoshida Hiroko Yoshida (Osaka Daizaka City, Osaka Prefecture) 1-10-8 Nishitenma 1-10-88, Yoshida Hirotsu Lawyer, telephone number 663-6038.
The company was founded in June 1895 and was reorganized into a company in April 1961.
Initially, the company started business as a manufacturer of Ibushi Kawara, a magnetic industry in Awaji Island, at the Motobu-machi (now Minami-Awaji City) in the Kinki business.
In October 1986 the company acquired a subsidiary of the Co-operative Co., Ltd. and the Kinki Industrial Co., Ltd., and then moved the head office to the current trade fair.
After that, sales bases were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system, which led to the establishment of the Ibushigawa River.However, due to changes in consumer needs, the Hiraban-gawa River was produced at a rate of 70 percent and 30% of the Ibushigawa River.
The company has built a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, including large house manufacturers, construction companies, and roof construction companies, and in December 2004 it has a net sales of around 31 billion yen.
As a top tile manufacturer of Awaji Island, we had a well-known reputation.
However, due to the stagnation of the housing market after the Lehman shock, the damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the earthquake in Kumamoto and other disasters, the demand for the consumer's roof was growing, and in the end of December 2018, the annual net sales of around 144 million yen.
In addition to the decrease in profits associated with fuel prices, a continuous deficit with excessively favorable debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment was forced to lead to severe funding.
For this reason, I was trying to rebuild management by asking financial institutions to pay the repayment terms and conditions for borrowing.However, there was no signs of recovery today.
We decided to continue our business, which was not supported here.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be around 20 billion yen.

What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yusuke Kobayashi, who is a member of DmMiX's subsidiary and staff first, was actually a member of YouTuber's adopted subsidiary.
With YouTuber, I want to support young people with cancer.
What kind of mechanism is the adoption of YouTuber?
Kobayashi Yuki Kobayashi: Now, YouTuber is a profession of many young people.
The number of elementary school students will be higher in the future, and young people will continue to grow.
We have adopted and supported young people who dreamed of bandman and comedians.
In the same way, the adoption of a young person who is dreaming of becoming YouTuber is the adoption of YouTuber.
The idea of YouTuber is that individuals voluntarily submit video posts, but why did you think that they would adopt them?
Kobayashi: While many young people dream about YouTuber's profession, most YouTubers have a reality that they don't have any revenue.
There are few creators who have posted video productions and posts while working on a part-time job.
In this effort, we will provide the creators with an environment for salaries and content policies.
At first, I believe that the benefits of the work of YouTuber, which makes it an unstable position, will support our activities.

The badminton tournament, which started in May, ended the World Championships, kicked off the top tournament (Super 500 or more) that the top players will play.
I kept the principal in the first half of the tournament, with Momota, who won the championship in the fourth tournament, and two people from Taiwan's weekly exhibition "Ken Tenchen."
Momota won the World Championships, the S1000 in Indonesia, and the high point of the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympics race.
In addition to that, Momota also has a JapanOP (S750).
The tournament, which has been held since May, will be the 4th tournament of the World Championships (May/May), IndonesiaOP (July / July), JapanOP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Compared to other top players, the number is small, but it is scheduled to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, it was only one tournament in the World Championships, but it will not be much fatigued.
After September, the high-end tournament will be required for high-end results.
Ace of strong Taiwan.
Attention to young people in Thailand.
In the same tournament, the tournament was already held at the top of IndonesiaOP and ThailandOP (S500).
He also participated in the 9th Tokyo International TaipeiOP (S300) and won the prize.
Originally, the physical strength is strong, and the player does not hold the war.
Even after the tournament, there is no problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
It was an impression that the transition had reached an explosive power until last year, but the stability in the play surface increased.
For Momota, the world's top ranked first place, it seems to be more than ever.
I left the results in the first half of the line except the two players, but the Thai young Ace Kanta font, the Sai Planney B...
It is the three players of Unders Antonsen, who is a European tax collector.
Kantaphon has not been able to enter the finals at the top of the tournament, but at the 2nd season, he has won the top prize.
Although there is still a rough side, it is said that at the age of 20 (21 years on the 18th) that the rally was established with top players, there is a great possibility of leaping in the Olympic race.
In addition, Sai Planneys B. took out one step in India to set up a player in singles.
It is necessary to be careful about Indian characteristics after the mid-tier line, just as Samir Balma, Pranoi H.S. and Kega's late Survivors Khambi will continue.
A new cost-of-use competition: Hokkaido Newspaper
Revision of the Telecommunications Business Act in October A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was planned.
But it was almost stopped.
As the head of the Cabinet Office said, "There is room to drop by about 40 percent" and the price competition was not going.
The real-world entry of Rakuten is a major factor that has remained on the river.
It is desirable for consumers to be a cost system that is easy to use.
I want to seek the efforts of mobile companies.
The revised law prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication.
Instead of the terminal or the number of terminals, the communication volume was reduced.
SOFTBANK and KDDI announced plans to make the terminal a maximum and half-price.
However, the "SIM Lock" system that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will make up the maximum number of terminals for only the subscribers of its own line.
The three companies also appear to have continued "contraction" to prevent transfer to other companies.
Regarding SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications indicated the policy to refrain from immediate release.
Companies must respond promptly.
The postponement of Rakuten did not proceed as planned by the establishment of a communication network.
It was only expected that the nexus competition would be sterile.
I think that there was the sweetness of the outlook.
It is not clear the timing and charges at the start of the service.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for the business.
The charges were made by the Secretary General of Japan.
Mr. Seki commented on the new charges of three companies: "I think that competition will start in the future, and I have never thought about it."
However, it seems that "enhancing down" will make the market more competitive.
The corporate side should develop a customer's competition before being transferred from the government.
The fee structure of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Agency noted that there is a case that the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount of money, while the terminal has advertising such as "up to half".
In order to avoid misunderstandings of the user, we must carefully and understand the explanation.
The cash card in Mie Prefecture will be reduced to 50 million yen to 5 million yen.

[ Rugby W High] One more and more players in the U.S. and U.S., "The ANSWER" - News
The U.S. FL Quartz is a rough player, not a former English representative.
The Rugby World Cup (W yes) The Japanese tournament was held on 26th, and the final appearance in 20 countries was the 7-45 toast.
It became a black-boiled, but in the second half, the rough play played by the FL John Kuru.
In the face of the opponent, it is more than one by one.
The actual scene will also be released with video, and the former English player is "suffering and non-scrupulous" (not called a tackle).
"Video" insulting and introspective play" and the overseas audience!
More than a single shot, it is a pulverization that the two military players enter...The United States representative Kuru played "face dangerous tackle"
The hot investment exceeded a thousand.
It is a 29-minute walk from 0-38.
The enemy was deeply impressed by the fact that the British Prime Minister Farrell had a somewhat balance.
I went to the tackle.
However, not from the waist to the bottom, the body was violently shaken.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other.
Farrell was violently blown away and fell down.
In the play that clearly wrote the legitimacy, he gave a lecture on English athletes.
Both players gathered together and became the first air of the solar eclipse.
The result of the "video judgment" is more than one by one with a red card.
After the pitch with a bad punishment, the audience asked for a fair play.
Rugby Competition New Zealand's local media "staff" will be featured in the Rugby World Cup 2019: The U.S. athletes played a fiercely played place, and the UK has lost their headlines.
"Kill made a strong shoulder charge in the face of the English Star player Farrell, and was more than one," he said.
In the article, we introduced comments from the former English player, Komenteo Monya.
"It is insulting, non-depressive, but not called a tackle," he said.
The United States, who wrote one of the games, had managed to escape the defeat by taking a try to maintain in 81 minutes.
However, the play of the pile has left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare issued the 424 hospital name for the first time in a public hospital, including 1455 public hospitals and two seats.
In Fukui Prefecture, we examined the results of the treatment of the 14 public hospital facilities, and four facilities were included in the Oda hospital in Takahama-machi, Oda hospital in Oda-machi, Echizen-machi, Oda Hospital, a national hospital in Aizuwara City.
The fourth hospital for reorganisation is "the standard strange".
In order to reduce the medical costs in aging, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in the competitive area.
In October, the hospital requested a full-scale review of the reorganization and integration of the hospital.
There is no force, but the reaction of local claims and residents is expected to get lost in a short hospital.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The hospital had a relatively small number of beds, with a total of 29.1 percent.
In the prefecture, the percentage was high in terms of Niigata (53,7 percent), Hokkaido (48,6 percent), Miyagi (47,5 percent), Yamaguchi (46,7 percent) and Okayama (43,3 percent).
The number of subjects was the highest of 54 in Hokkaido and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on the data from fiscal 2017 the Ministry of Health, Forestry and Welfare investigates 1455 hospitals that can respond to "high-grade" for patients with high efficiency and public hospitals.
We analyzed the medical results of 9 items such as gas and emergency medical equipment, and whether the hospital is within 20 minutes by car, and decided the need for hospital announcement.
The hospital will be subject to review the elimination and some medical treatment to other hospitals.
The medical costs will increase in the past 25 years, with a total of 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Finance has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in one hospital in 18 years to 19.1 thousand units.
Currently, there is a large number of beds for nursing care and a large number of "high-grade" and " acute age" that require elderly people with high rehab.
To respond to aging, you need to simply reduce the number of beds, but also increase rehabilitation.
In response to the reorganization and integration of the hospital, the concept of "regional medical care" was established in order to determine the number of beds required in 25 years.
In the 339 regions of the country, local governments and medical officials are competing, but many of the local residents and claims remain cautious, and discussions are inconvenient.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing hospital names with poor results.

The recommended area of these vaccinations (Fukushima Newspaper Web) - Yahoo!
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a revision of the Trade Guidelines that allow vaccinations to prevent vaccinations to prevent vaccinations to prevent the spread of livestock infections, pigs, and these, in order to prevent infection.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have confirmed the infection of pigs and wild boar.
Movements such as living pigs and fertilization are limited in the region, but distribution of meat and processed products is permitted.
Through public comments to the public, we aim to complete the procedures in early October.
By using vaccines and recognizing extracellular distribution such as meat, there is a possibility that the "normal country" approved by international institutions may be affected by pork exports.
After the outbreak of September last year, Japan had a temporary pending status of normal countries.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set the vaccination recommendations area, based on the opinions of experts on areas where the risk of infection to pigs is high.
The prefecture will create a vaccination program that summarizes the range of vaccinations, time, headcounts, etc., and allow use in the judgment.
The other seven prefectures that are rising as a recommended area are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, and Shiga.
The area will decide again when the guidelines are revised.
Movements such as ingested pigs, semen, fertilization, body and lunge are basically limited in the region.
For meat and processed products, they are not subject to the effects of distribution restrictions or on farmers.
Because the virus is not spreading, it thoroughly handles food waste.
We will appeal to the safety of the infected pigs to prevent weather damage.
The draft proposal was confirmed at the meeting of the Trade Countermeasures Headquarters.
We will continue to introduce opinions to local governments and public comments to the public until October 7th.
An independent Honda Kei Yu and ManU approach!
(Please do not need money) Football Channel - Yahoo! News
9/28 [Sat] 2:57 Delivery
As far as last year, I interviewed Melbourne Biquiet in Australia, A League of Australia and Australia, and now I have been surprised by the surprising behavior of MF Honda.
"Video" Honda Kei Yu, actually came out of the game.
The truth of the point is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at the end of the 27th, said, "Please do not need the offer, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates," said one club's public approach.
The other person who sent the reverse offer is the world-class Manchester United.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the top competitor club in the Premier League?
The story was published on the 24th of the Australian edition of the FOX Sport.
In the article entitled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could win in the wounded crisis", five non-profit athletes were picked up.
There were also names of Honda players such as Tenm Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilhelm Bombay.
At the same time, U.S. officials including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DDF Eric Byli, FFAN Tony Maltese, Marcus FWford, etc. are in danger.
The "Red Devil" led by the director of Ole Gunner Sulawal, was forced to make two wins in the league with 22 wins and a distressed slip.
So, it was Honda that the Australian media gave a name as a candidate for freshness.
In the article, "The Honda contract as a creative side player, rather than a home bus and car, can be buried in a hole filled by Andreas Pereira."
The nine points to play in the 18-game play in Melbourne Biquistia are "conceived record" but "The 33-year-old Honda must leave his entertainment to manage Cambodian representatives and collect full attention."
But is the approach of Honda?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move toward the next Tokyo Olympics for the next year's veteran.

The Shogi staff said, "We want to develop new customers for foreigners while operating conditions are severe."
Now, Dora Manike Village Hiroyo is not necessary for the first time.
Today's Cathy Best Shot
1W shots are not necessarily low-up and lost.
When you want to earn a distance at the 2nd stage of par5, you can see the ball on the ground, and you can see the so-called "dora" technique.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which has the risk of the ball, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
The first victory of the tour is Yuyo Ikemura.
The 24-year-old is 166cm tall, and is currently 7th in the driving direction division (average 304.02yd).
While good at long shots, there was a fairway Wood system in one of the issues.
At the beginning of spring, I thought I would try to do a shot of spoon 3W.
From the practice round to the grass in the area, the ball pops up, and you can also sprinkle 1W in a nutshell.
In the case of Big Carry, we have a variety of taps, but both sides are effectively utilized in small halls.
"It is possible to use a hole in which your eyes are broken down."
In a ballistic measurement machine, we recorded 270yd to 280 ydsd in carry.
"I don't have 3W, so it's easier for Kaddy to be more comfortable than 3W...
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the cadi bag.
The second long club has a loft of 17 degrees.
The surprise from the tour companions is also a simple voice that leaks from the gallery.
Do you think that the club will behave horizontally?
"Even if you hit down, you can't fly straight at the upper, and then go to the right as a cut-up."At the beginning, I was doing the right hand-winding of the 1W shot.
The ball is caught, and the risk of slices is associated with the left side (no harm to the left).
It's easy to say, but it's a professional skill that is unthinkable.

And adults don't want to face the crisis on the climate and the environment, but I found that the topic of the story is changing.
Why adults laugh at teens and children, and spend time on Odosu, honestly, I cannot understand.
It will be another good at that time.

[Video] Japan is coming!
Colored edge shot
I thought that I could go through that momentum in the first half, but it was frustrating because I could not go out well.
Did you see the winner in the 6th Eagle, 7th Bardi?
Even after the Boggy hit on the 4th, the par5 remained, so if I was in a tricasian feeling, the chip-in Eagle came on the 6th.
Even on the 7th night, Bardi gave a chance, but it was regrettable that it was not late.
What did you get in the tournament?
Since the shot was not good lately, it was good that the fairway remained solid in the narrow course.
I learned a lot because I was not "experienced" because the roughness and the reverse eye are completely different.
What is the difference between the regular tournament?
It was possible to shoot a camera like a smartphone.
I didn't care about it, but it was a video of the gallery.
There was little change, but I wanted to play the game because there were few Japanese players in the tournament, so I could not lose to overseas players.
I would like to win again because I don't have more than one value, but I would like to win another, and I would like to make my best efforts to qualify for the tournament as well.
Is it a way to prevent dementia and to "get" degree?
Interview, Bunka Watanabe "Tanabe Yo"
A drug that has been frustrated by the research and development of major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been clarified, and it is likely that it can be highly inherited and forgotten.
Prof. Shunsuke Osaki told me about the hospital stroke center at Kinki University Hospital.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation that we are looking forward to the prevention or treatment of dementia?
There is a difference between aging and seriousness, and it may be a cognitive impairment.
However, it is believed that new dementia drugs will develop over 20 years.
Drugs used in Japan are already outside of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and remarkable sensing effects cannot be expected.
On the other hand, mortality from infections and accidents has decreased, and cancer mortality has decreased dramatically in the treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the individual or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment where society can live in peace.
Do not forget about how to get around
Is there a person that is prone to dementia and is difficult to become?
Even if it is inevitable to be dementia, it is possible to reduce the symptoms as much as possible and to "get" degree.
The dementia is thought to be one of the living habits and tends to be easy to grow.
First, metabolites tend to be prone to dementia.
The dementia is perceived as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol levels.
It also affects economic power.
For example, in the United States, there is a region that distributes food tickets to the poor, but food is available for food tickets, hamburgers and pizzas.
You can't use gas and electricity, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook.
It becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein and relies on oil and investment.
After all, it is poor but obese, and when I do it, I only see the television and the body becomes uncomfortable.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things tend to be prone to dementia.
In other words, it is necessary to think about things that are not metabolized to prevent dementia.
