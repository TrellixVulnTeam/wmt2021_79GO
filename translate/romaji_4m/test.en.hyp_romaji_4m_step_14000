Driving in the heel is dangerous!
The first time of a young man's pedal accident (AutoMese web) - Yahoo!
A violation of the traffic traffic traffic laws
It's a big mistake to think that it's a problem only for the elderly drivers, although it's a lot of attention to reporting accidents due to mistaking of pedals.
In the "2015 National Police Agency data", the number of pedals in the past is more than 1032, which is the highest age in the 24 years and below.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well as not many elderly people.
Are you taking your outfit?
Do you take safety?
There is no mention of gender or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be weak in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, young men and women are aware of other things such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose various shoes by wearing high heels, panps, sandals, mulls, and sun attire.
Some people know that it's hard to change while driving, but some people don't think about the possibility that it can lead to danger and often drive without bad luck.
However, driving with high heels and sandals is bound by traffic laws.
One is to ensure that handle, brake, and other operations are performed, and "Do not drive to make accidents and harm to people" in Article 70 (the violation of the obligation of safe driving).
The other is that the driver must comply with the matters specified by the Nuclear Commission on Public Security (the Security Committee violations), for example, in Article 12 of the Road Traffic Law of Miyazaki Prefecture, there is a vehicle that does not prevent any damage or operation of a machine that prevents the operation of a machine that prevents the operation of a machine, slippers, shoes, or other operation.
It is similar to that of the nuclear and Dofuken, which violates the operation of "hakimonos that may interfere with driving operations".
So why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?
It is obvious if you consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and realistic pedal operations, first place the foot cavity on the floor and place the legs to be perpendicular to the brake pedal and tilt the foot right as a point of view.
At this time, it is important to firmly fix it so that even though the behavior of the car does not fit.
However, in the high heel, the size of the cadrel is small and the area of the floor is always blurred, and the height of the heel has an angular angle on the whole foot, so the area of the foot placed on the pedals is smaller and less rigid.
This is thought to lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to attach to it, and when it comes to a brake, it is sometimes hard to take the pedals.
In addition, there are cases where the cock is attached to the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is not returned.

Hitachi Cable Co., Ltd., Ltd., Ltd., was founded in June 1895 and was reorganized as a company in 1961.
At the beginning, he started his business as a manufacturer of Ubishi tiles, the magnetic field industry of Awaji Island at Moto Minami-Awaji City in the name of Kinki Shogunate.
At the same time, in October86, the company absorbed the company of the Koganei Kogyo Co., Ltd., and the business of Kinki Industry Co., Ltd., and moved to the current headquarters of the new headquarters to the current name.
After that, the business base was established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system.However, as a result of the change in consumer needs, it was manufactured at a rate of 70 percent for the Hiraban tiles, and 30% of Japanese tiles such as Ibushi tiles.
We have established a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, such as large-scale house manufacturers, construction companies, and roof construction companies, and in December 2004, we recorded annual sales of about 31.16 million yen.
As one of the top tile manufacturers in Awaji Island, it was well known.
However, due to the sluggish housing prices since the Lehman shock, the damage of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the damage of the Kumamoto Earthquake, the demand for the loss of consumer roofs has been increasing, and sales in the fiscal year ended in December 2018.

Here, I decided to continue the project without support, and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

What is "beautiful"?
The image of "Motherms" that is the main image of the movie "Millas" - Yahoo!
What is a common sense of mystical beauty and shadow?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Word cartoon" was released in August 2019 by the "Milth Kazuo" collection, which focuses on the beauty of Umezu Kazuo, who is known as the first person of "Word cartoon".
When you look at it, you will notice that there is a correlation between the beauty and fear of Kazuo Umeda's work.
It is attractive because there is a shadow.
Umezu Kazuo's beautiful girl (five pieces)
There was also a part of the "Hokkaido Collection" chapter, "The fear, state, the impact of the story, and the beauty of the scenes and the development of the story, but the beautiful face changes to the distortion and the expression of the resentment that dwells in the warm years ... ...
There is a keyword called "s serpent" that appears in many works, but there are various ways to receive snakes, as seen by the viewer, who perceive them as "selfless creatures" or "beautiful".
Some people like reptiles in the world, but others say they don't like them.
By the completion of the viewer, "beautiful" and "shukushaku" can be described as "shape".
This creature has been rising since ancient times as a living creature, and "white snake" is said to be auspicious.
The work of Umezu, inspired by the serpent, contains "Matsuga Kowai!" series "Sakura Girl" and "Madara Girl".
It is the market for a woman with a shadow.
If you're talking about it now, "coolbusty" type and even the house?...I feel like the commonality of the girls appearing in the work.
In particular, "Orochi" is the main character of "Orochi" that has been serialized in "Creek Shonen Sunday" since 1969, but it is a female character that is a symbol of Umezu's work, but it is reminiscent of a snake that has a deep sleep every hundred years to keep eternal life and eternal difference.

Compared to 2018, there has been a surge of 1 and 6 times, and there are 24 places in Fukui Prefecture that have a total of 9 places.
Why is the children's restaurant?
Yuasa Makoto, a social activist at the Director General of the NPO, discussed the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
The area becomes lonely due to the declining birthrate and the shopping street declines.
There is no place for people to meet.
There, he said, "There was a need for a regional exchange base where people and people interact."
Although it is a children's cafeteria, it is also a place for multi-generation exchanges that the elderly participate.
Not only do you lose your child, it also leads to child rearing support and the health of the elderly.
Let's stop the chain of poverty and grow the region.
What's important is that you don't have to make children that you can do from there.
From the 1st floor of this month to the place where you can provide meals every day.

However, it is difficult to manage and ensure staff.
You may listen to issues such as safety management systems.
Even though it is a project, "the values change by engaging with many people" "The connection with society will be a safety net for disasters and other disasters."
It seems like a light of hope for closed society.

It can be manufactured cheaply and the subsequent distance is about 1000 km.
To fly, it is hard to capture radars."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramiko, was bombed by 10 military drone.
On the other hand, the rebels of Yemen announced their rebellious life.
"The reason behind the Fushi is that Iran, led by President Rouhani, does not allow Saudi Arabia to be established in crude oil under the circumstances where the country cannot export crude oil," says Sugawara.
After the bombing, half of the total oil production of Saudi Arabia stopped, and crude oil prices recorded 15 percent of the total.
In this situation, there is a voice that the oil shock is re-relenting.

YouTuber, who is now very popular with young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use ads for their products, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called YouTuber adoption, which are used as regular employees.
Direct marketing mix (hereinafter referred to as DmM MiX) is a direct marketing mix, which is the main business of the company's CRM.
What do you think of using YouTuber?
He was the director of DmM MiX, and this time I talked to Kobayashi Fuki, who also served as the representative of the company's first staff.
YouTuber wants to support young people who play with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is YouTuber adoption?
Yusuke Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): Now the occupation of YouTuber has become a longing for many young people.
The higher the rankings for elementary school students who want to be in the future, and the number of young people will increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have dreamed of bandman and comedians.
In the same way, it is YouTuber hiring a young man who is dreaming of becoming a YouTuber.
There is an image of YouTuber that the individual voluntarily makes a video post, but why did you decide to adopt it?
Kobayashi: While many young people have longed for the occupation of YouTuber, most YouTubers have a reality that they don't have any revenue they thought.
There are many creators who are working on video production and post while working part-time, and creators who don't recognize the existence of YouTube.
In this effort, we provide the environment for the creators who have adopted paychecks and content policies.
At first, I think that we will support activities by supporting the benefits of the occupation of YouTuber, which will become unstable.

Yasunori Nakamura
(The first half of the race of the Bado Olympics) The world champion, Taoyuan, and the principal's state of heavens are the first step.
Men's singles "Bado √ó spirits!
The Japan National Team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, held in August, completed the reinforcement in early September, and participated in the China OP, which opened from 17th September.
Here, we will look forward to the men's singles for "September-December" while looking back at the first half of the race from May to August, when the Tokyo Olympics began.
The Badminton Olympic race, which began in May, was extinguished the Super 500 or more tournament, which was held by top athletes at the end of the World Championships.
In the first half of the race, he won the second prize in the 4th round, and the second winner of the 4th prize, and two people in Taiwan's "Ge Tien Cheng".
Tao Taoda won the World Championships and the National Tenity Championships in Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Points that are directly connected to the Olympic Games.
On the other hand, Momota is also active in JapanOP (S750).
The tournament, which has participated since May, is the 4th tournament of the Group's Sludiman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July / Result 16), Japan OP (July), and World Championships (August).
Compared to other top players, the number is small, but it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
It was only one of the World Championships in August, so it would not be much more fatigue than the time of the race.
From September onwards, public results are required in the middle line where the top competitions are held.
Ace in Taiwan with a strong line.
It is also noteworthy for young people in Thailand.
At the same time, the winner of the top prize of the Indonesian OP and ThailandOP (S500) is already in the 7th tournament.
He also participated in the 9-storied local Taipei OP (S300) and won the grand prize.
Originally, the physical is strong, and the athletes who do not follow the line.
Even if the tournament continues, there is no problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming Games by winning high points in the first half.
It was the impression that it was explosive until last year, but this year, the stability of the play surface was increased, so it was able to continue its calibration.
For Momota, the world's first ranking, it seems to be more than ever.
In addition to these two athletes, the results were made in the first half, but the Thai young Ace Kanta font Indian Cyce Planneys B.
It is also the third player of the Unders Antonin, who is a European tax collector.
Kantafone is not the only way to enter the finals at the top of the competition, but has the highest value in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, it is said that the 20th-year-old "21 years on the 18th" has the potential to leap into the race.
In addition, Cai Planneys B. was one step away in India, where she has a single player.
It is necessary to pay attention to the Indian system since the middle line, as it is expected to continue to recover from the coming months of the Samir Rosema, Pranoi H.S., and Survivor Khambi.
A new price competition in the form of a product: Hokkaido newspaper Doshin Electronics Edition
Revision of the Telecommunications Business Law In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company accompanying the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Law was launched.
However, it has become generally high.
Despite the growing expectations for the decline in prices, the price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry of Rakuten is ahead and the three major rivers remain.
It is desirable for consumers to become a cost system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I would like to ask for their own efforts.
The amended Act prohibits a set of terminals and communication fees.
Instead of having to repeat the device, it was set to reduce communication volume.
SoftBank Corp. and KDDI announced a plan to make the device up to half-priced.
However, the "SIM Lock" which cannot be used by other companies for 100 days is the mechanism for the terminal.
NTT DOCOMO makes the most of the terminals for only the contractors on its own line.
It seems that the three companies continue to transfer to others.
Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications decided to immediately terminate it.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay of Rakuten was that the maintenance of communication networks such as base stations was not going as planned.
It was expected that it would be a waste of the competition, but it was a good choice.
I wonder if there was the sweetness of the outlook.
It is not clear the timing and fees of the full service.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want to work on business with responsibility.
This time, the charge was given by the Secretary-General.
Mr. Kan said, "I think that competition will start in the future, and I have no idea what to do."
However, it doesn't seem that "drying" is encouraging a healthy competition, as the market continues.
The corporate side should develop a customer's competition before being left by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Agency called for attention as there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds the amount of money, although the device has a "maximized" advertisement.
We need to be careful and easy to explain to companies to avoid misunderstandings of users.

The Rugby World Cup (W Yes) Japan Competition was held on 26th, and the United States, which was the last appearance in 20 countries, toasted in England 7-45.
It was black and white, but in the second half, it was called the rough play played by FL John Cylus.
The other person's face has a shoulder tackle in a similar way.
The real scene has also been released by overseas media, and the former English player has stopped saying "It is insult and non-responsive play".
(Video) "An insulting and non-destructive play" and "I've been abroad!
More than a single shot, the homologization of the two-guns. ..The real moment of the "faced risk tackle" played by the U.S. leader Kyle.
The hot investment exceeded a thousand.
It is a 29-minute walk from 0-38.
The enemy was deep and the English prime minister Farrell had a slightly different balance when catching the path of view.
I went to this task, but it was a krill.
However, it causes the condition not from the waist to the lower, and the upper body has a strong body.
As a result, the opponent's head and head are in contact with each other's head.
Farrell was struck and fell.
In the play that clearly wrote the legitimacy, the English player is taught as a martial artist.
Both of them gathered at once and became the air of the first time.
As a result of TMO's video judgment, Hangzhou is more than one with a red card.

In the article, the former English representative player, Komenta's comments are introduced.
He said, "It is insulting, not to be called a tackle.It is a fierce play," and he stopped the phrase.
The U.S., who wrote one of the matches, managed to escape the defeat of the U.S. with a try to keep in 81 minutes.
However, the play of the cabal has left a bad aftertaste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced on September 26 that it was the first of the 424 hospitals in which the public hospitals, including the 1455 public hospitals and Nisseki wards nationwide, were judged to have poor clinical results.
In Fukui Prefecture, there were four facilities of Wakasa Takahama Hospital, the Wakasa Takahama Hospital, located in Oda-machi, Sakai City Hospital, the National Hospital in Awara City, Sakai City, Ibaraki Prefecture.
‚áí The fourth hospital for the reorganization (privileged)
In order to reduce the cost of expanding in the ageing population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in the conflicting region.
In October, the hospital requested a full-scale review of its reorganization and integration, and decided to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, it is expected that local claims and repulsive oppositions are expected from the anxiety that a short hospital will disappear.
It was released at the same time.
The hospital was filled with a total of 29 and 1%, with a relatively small number of beds.
In the prefecture, Niigata (53,7 percent), Hokkaido (48,6 percent), Miyagi (47,5% percent), Yamaguchi (46,7 percent), Okayama (43,3%), and Okayama (43,3 percent).
The number of objects was the highest in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigates 1455 hospitals that are capable of responding to "highly acute" and "acute" for patients with severe injuries.
We analyzed the results of nine medical trials, such as cancer and medical care, and whether a conflict hospital is located within 20 minutes by car, and decided the need to announce hospital name.
In the targeted hospital, we will consider abolishing and transferring some medical care to other hospitals.
Medical costs surged in 25 years, which is 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in the hospital in 18 years to 119 million per floor.
At present, there are many beds of "highly acute" and "emergency" which are used for nursing care, but the elderly are lacking in rehabilitation.
In order to respond to aging, it is necessary to simply reduce the number of beds, but also increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of the hospital, we formulated the "regional medical concept" which stipulates the number of beds needed in 25 years.
Although local governments and medical personnel are divided into 339 regions of the country, many of the local residents and claims have maintained their cautious stance, and discussions have ceased.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced a poor hospital name and hopes to activate the discussion.

The recommended area of these vaccines is the Gifu Shimbun website - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Forestry and Fisheries released a revision of the Trade Guidelines, which enable vaccinations to prevent the spread of livestock infectious diseases, such as pigs (tons) and pigs, which are not currently permitted, on 27th.
The target area is selected by nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where the infection of pigs and wild boar is confirmed.
Transfers such as living pigs and fertilized eggs are limited to the region, but distribution of meat and processed products is permitted.
Through public comments to the public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and recognition of extracellular distribution such as meat, it is possible that the "normal" approved by international organizations will disappear and will affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan was in a state where the status of the normal country was temporarily suspended.
In the draft, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set the vaccine recommended area based on expert opinions on areas where the risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The prefectural government of the prefecture creates a vaccine vaccination program that summarizes the range, time, head count, and the way to proceed.
The other seven areas that are rising as recommended areas are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, and Shiga.
The region is determined once again when the guidelines are revised.
Moving pigs, semen, fertilization, corpses, etc. that have been taken, is limited to the region as a rule.
For meat and processed goods, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions or the impact of farmers, but to accept the distribution of goods virtually outside.
Because the virus is not spread, it thoroughly processes food waste.
He also addresses the safety of the infected pig and also strives to prevent damage to the envelope.
The revision of the Guidelines was confirmed at the meeting of the Trade Countermeasures Headquarters.
In the future, the Government of Japan will introduce the views and public comments to the prefectural government until October 7th.
It's an independent Honda Kei Yu and a public approach to ManU!
"Please do not need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo!
9/28 (Sat.) 2:57 Delivery:
As far as last year, I talked about Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and now I am confident that I am now an independent man.
"Video" Honda Kei Yu, actually came to the game.
The truth of the sutras is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th, said, "Please do not need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the reverse offer is Manchester United, the world's famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the top competitor club in the Premier League?
It was published on the 24th of the Australian edition of Fox Sports.
In the article titled "The Five Fs that Manchester United might grab in the crisis of the wounded," five independent athletes who are currently able to win were picked up.
There was also the name of Honda among the athletes such as Tam Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, Will Fado Bonnie.
At the present time, the U.S. is suffering from injuries such as the U.S. Pole Pogba, DDR Luke Show, D.D. Eric Bailly, FAN Tony Maltese, Federated, and Federated in emergencies.
The "Red Devil" led by Al Ole Gunner Surusha, is a League Line that has two wins and 22 wins and suffers, and is facing the quality of the front line.
It was Honda that Australia media named it as a fresh candidate for the tail.
In the article, "The Honda contract as a creative side player can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira," he said.
The 9th score for the 18th match in Melbourne Victory is "real record," but "The 33-year-old Honda needs to attract full attention from his entertainment that manages Cambodian representatives."

Today's Kadi's Best Shot shot
One Wshot is not always low-up and hit.
When you want to earn a distance with the second layer of par5, there is also a technique called "directed hair".
Recently one W has a large head volume, which causes the ball to be tilized, but there are many players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroshi, who is the first victory in the tour.
The 24th-year-old city in professional seven years has a height of 166 cm and is currently seventh in the driving force sector (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairway Wood.
In the spring, "Canon (3W) shot was not allowed, so I would like to try to do it directly."
From the practice round to the grass in the area, you can drop the ball and turn it into one W.
In cases where Big Carry is required, it has a variety of tailoring, but both sides are effectively used in small hall and other facilities.
"It can be used in the hall where your eyes are thrown down and you can use it."
It records 270yd to 280yds in Carry in a ballistic measuring machine.
(So there are no 3Ws, so I can't worry about it.Cydy is more secure than 3W.)
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only one W in the caddie bag.
The second long club is a loft of 17 degrees.
It's also nice to hear a simple voice that is surprised by the tour mates from the bottom gallery.
Is the pelvice acting as a club level?
(Even if you lose down or down on the upper, you don't fly straight.I went to the right when it is a cut startup.I originally had a direct hair dryer to force the swing of the 1W shots when I started to play.This practice also makes the attack angle (the club's entry angle).
The ball is not caught, and the risk of the slice is accompanied by the risk of the slice (so the left side is removed).
It's easy to say, but it's a professional skill that I don't know.

Gulete Tounbeli (Why do adults laugh and do so?) We have doubts on Twitter.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York on September 23, Sweden's environmental activist Gulete Dongbaley gave a speech.
On the other hand, while the speech has been attracting attention, it is becoming a rash that insults me.
Greta Tounbury says, "Why are adults laughing for children?"
The political critic commented on Greta on American television programs, "I am mentally ill, being used by parents and international left-wings."
In Japan, on the internet, there are many things to say, "It is used and I want to go to school."
In such a situation, Mr. Guletre said on September 26 that "Why do adults laugh at the 10th youth and children, and spend time in Odosu?"
"I'll think about lying and conspiracy theories as much as possible."
Mr. Gulettre said, "As I was aware, the people who hate me are still active.My appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and my attitude, I turned out to be different from the person, and they started to post that they think as long as lying or conspiracy theory."
And adults didn't want to confront the climate or environmental crisis, but they pointed out that they seemed to have a different background.
Why adults laugh at the teens and children, and spend time in Odosu, honestly, I can't understand why.
It would be another good at that time.
I think they feel that they are threatened by us.
But do not consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
Changes are coming.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
Come to the streets on Friday.
On the 20th day of the previous week's Friday, New York and other countries around the world had strikes on climate change.
Mr. Gulettre called on Friday 27th.

Akita TV's 32nd broadcast program "Koba Kiyohiko" was opened, and on August 16 the "Editor, Cook Professional, celebrities" of the broadcast, discussed "The Curry of Akita I'm really looking forward to".
The program introduced each of the best curry shops, points to enjoy professional taste at home, and a special retortion and curing of curry.
A member commented, "The simple concept and theme are clear" (I was seen in my interest until the end: curry pans were introduced and there was a tempo) "I was able to see them from a different point of view from a gourmet site", but also "I wanted to advise one point of professional curry making".
Hoshino Riya (Rough's Shibame became a study of the difference from usual) experience, aiming for a reward in the reverse (P Golf Network) - Yahoo!
The "Open to Shinhandon" was held on 22nd, and the final round was held at the Korean Bear's Best Cheonna Golf Club (7238 yards per 71), and the Hoshino Riya took place in the 1st, 2 Eagle, 2 Bardi, and 1 Boggy's '68'.
"Video" come to Japan.
Garcia brain edge shot
I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was frustrating because I wanted to be able to go well.
Did you see the 6th Eagle, the 7th Bardi winner?
Even after losing Boggy in the 4th edition, the par 5 was left, so if I had a feeling of trifulation, I came to the 6th edition of the chip-in Eagle.
Even in the 7th edition, Bardi was able to write a chance, but it was frustrating that it wasn't going to be late.
What you got in the competition?
I didn't have a lot of shots in recent years, so it was good to keep them in a narrow course.
It was a course that changed the way and distance, so I learned a lot because I didn't have any experience.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
I think it was possible to shoot cameras such as smartphones.
I didn't care about it at all, but I had a video or something for the gallery.
I didn't have anything else, but I just wanted a game with a sense of "I don't lose it to overseas athletes" because it is a tournament where Japanese athletes are small.
I would like to win again because I don't have to aim for a win if I don't win, and at the end, I'd like to win another prize, so I'll try to win the top prize at the ZOZO championship.
What is the way to prevent dementia from becoming dementia?
Interview, Bun / Watanabe
A major pharmaceutical company and university hospital have been frustrated with the R&D challenges.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been clarified, and it has been found that it is possible to be extremely inherited and forgotten.
I talked to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki, who was at the hospital of Kinki University.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation? -Preventing dementia or treatment is expected, but what is the current situation?
It is possible for everyone to become aware of ageing if there is any difference between ageing and severity.
However, it is thought to take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Drugs that are commonly used in Japan have already been out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and there is no noticeable sense effect.
On the other hand, the death of infection and accidents has decreased, and cancer mortality has been reduced due to remarkable progress in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that patients with dementia are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve it by the individual or the family, but it is necessary to create an environment that can live with confidence in the community as a whole.
How to forget about things
People who are prone to dementia and who are hard to do?
Even if it is inevitable to become an otsuki dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and to make a difference.
The dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle habits, and it tends to be easy to grow.
First, Metabono people tend to become dementia.
The dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle habits.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence of economic strength.
For example, in the U.S., there are regions that distribute food tickets to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers and pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people who live in an environment where they cannot cook.
If you eat less vegetables and protein, you will be able to live a life that relies on the lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, although it is poor, it becomes obese, and if you want to do it, you only see TV as a boot.
The similar situation can be found in Japan.
In addition, people who don't think about things and don't work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to think about things that are not metabolized and read books from everyday times.
