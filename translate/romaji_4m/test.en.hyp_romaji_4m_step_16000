High Heel's driving is dangerous.
A young man's pedal mishaps the first time (Auto Messe Web) – Yahoo!
A violation of road traffic laws in violation of road traffic laws.
It is noted that there is an increasing number of reports of accidents due to mishaps of pedals, but it is a major mistake that I think it is only a problem with older drivers.
The number of mishaps in pedals by the age of the year 2015 (the police chief data) is the highest in the age of 1080, surpassing 1032 over the age of 75.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
How do you take your clothes?
Are you safe?
There is no mention of gender or cause of this data, but unlike older people who are often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflex nerves, young people are considered to be aware of other things, such as music and conversations, and may be misappropriated due to miscarriages.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, panps, sandals, mulls, and their attire.
While some know that driving is not suitable, it is troublesome to change, but some do not consider the possibility of a danger, and many are driving without bad luck.
However, driving in high heels and sandals is a violation of road traffic laws.
One is Article 70 (a violation of the safety obligations) which determines that "the handle, the brakes, and other operations are reliably manipulated", and that "should not be driven to cause accidents and harm people".
The other is Article 71 (a violation of the Public Safety Committee), which states that the driver must comply with the matters set forth by the Nuclear and Difken Public Safety Commission, for example, in Article 12 of the Road Traffic Act of Miyazaki Prefecture, there is a vehicle that does not interfere with the operation of the vehicle (a vehicle that prevents the operation of a vehicle that prevents the operation).
Both nuclear and doubenkens are similar to the intent that they would violate driving in "a machine that could prevent driving operations".
Why is it dangerous to drive a high heel?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedal operations.
For safe and realistic pedal operations, first place the foot cads on the floor and place a leg perpendicular to the brake pedal and tilt it to the right as a point of view when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not break.
However, in the high heel, the size of the cadka on the floor is small, and the constant gratification, and the overall angle of the foot at the height of the heel, so that the area of the foot in the pedal is small and difficult to adjust.
This is thought to lead to danger.
Most cars also have a floor carpet, but this material is easy to pick up a high-cut car, so it is sometimes too heavy to wear a brake, and a pedal is not put on, and a high heel is removed on the top of the hook and may not be caught in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is an example of the fact that when the pedal is pushed back, the heel will be pulled back and the accelerator pedal would not return.

The Kinki Ceramics, manufactured in Awaji, Awaji Island, is a quasi-synthetic debt of about 20 billion yen (the imperial data bank) - Yahoo!
The decline in housing bishops and the repeated disaster caused "consumption of consumers" to be affected.
TDB Corporation Code: 530173983, Capital 9.2 million yen, 881-8 in Awaji City, Hyōgo Prefecture, and 44 employees) filed for a net accident at Kobe on 30 August.
The new agent was a lawyer of the Yoshida domain (west Tenma 1-10-8, the Yoshida Land Law Office, telephone 06-665-6038), and one other.
The company was founded in June 1895, and was incorporated in April 1961.
Initially, the company started operations as a local manufacturer of Awaji Island, at the western town (present-day South Awaji) in the title of the Kinki business.
At the same time, in October 1986, the company absorbed the republican business and the business of the Kinki industry, and moved its headquarters to its original title.
The company then opened its operating base in Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Oita, and Miyazaki, where it was the present-day structure, and the predecessor was the Iveshi River, but due to changes in the consumer needs, the roof tiles, such as the Haban roof tiles, were built at a rate of 70 percent, and 30% of the width tiles.
The company built a wide range of operating bases in the West, including major house manufacturers, building materials, and roof builders, and in December 2004 it had an annual sales of around 31.6 million yen.
As the top manufacturer of Awaji Island, it had a great reputation.
However, the decline in housing prices after the Riemann shock, and the subsequent Great East Japan Earthquake, and the Kumamoto earthquake, caused the rise of consumers' roof, causing the demand to increase, and sales in the December 2018 fiscal year dropped to around 13.45 million yen.
In terms of revenue, in addition to a decline in profits associated with the rise in fuel prices, it was a continuous deficit with excess debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, which forced severe financing.
For this reason, they sought to re-establish their business, such as requiring financial institutions to repaid their debts, but there was no signs of recovery today, and the financial union gradually reced.
He did not come here, but abandoned his business, and this was the measure.
The debt is currently surveyed, but is estimated to be about 20 billion yen.

It is possible to produce cheaply, and its length is about 1000 km.

On 14 September, the largest oil company in Saudi Aramco was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, Hoshiha, announced a crime.
"The reason behind the windfall is that Iran, headed by President Rouhani, does not allow Saudi Arabia to be set up in crude oil in situations where time cannot export crude oil, and if it continues to take oil embargos against Iran, it is intended to make it known to the international community as a result of the pain they face."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production ceased, with 15% of the oil prices recorded.
As such, there is a voice that the oil shock is re-relieving.
"Trump would avoid military intervention until at least the next year's election is over, and Iran will continue to bomb the drone on the cover of the windfall, but the U.S. will not be able to continue forever."

It is now very popular with young people.
While it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, there are companies that have started a rare system called YouTuber adoption, which they use as a regular employee.

What is YouTuber?
Yuki Kobayashi: The occupation of YouTuber is now a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are at the top of their future professional rankings, and the number of young people who are willing to continue to grow.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have dreamed of bandman and comedians.
In the same way, it is the YouTuber adoption of a young man who dreams to become YouTuber.
What is YouTuber is an image of a person voluntarily posting a video, but why did you think it would be "appropriate"?
Kobayashi: While many young people aspire to YouTuber's profession, most YouTubers have a reality that they are not profitable.
There are also few creators who do not recognize the existence of YouTuber in their family, while working part-time.
This effort provides an environment for paid and content-making for creators who have adopted it.
At first, I think that the benefits of YouTuber's profession will be unstable and that we will support our activities.

Badminton's Olympic race, which began in May, was extinguished by the top players at the end of the World Championship (Super 500 or more) competitions.
In the first round, he held the lead in the first round, two of the four races in which he won the second prize, and two of the Taiwanese chieftains.
The Momota won the World Championships, the state championship, the Indonesian OP (S1000) and the high points of the "World Ranking Point" race directly connected to the Olympic race.
The peaches also have a JapaneseOP (S750).
The competition has been contested since May, with the Sudirman Cup (May/China), IndonesiaOP (July 16), JapanOP (July), and the World Championship (August).
Although the number of other top players is less than that of other players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one of the World Championships was held, so it would not be much more successful than the race.
After September, the top competitions are required to be held in a continuous midfield.
She is a strong Taiwanese ace.
The young people of Thailand are also impressed.
The winner of the competition at the top of the Indonesian OP and ThailandOP (S500) was already in the seventh round.
He also competed in the 9-month local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
Originally, the physical is strong and the player does not want to win the race.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, by gaining high points in the first half, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming competition.
The state transition had been an impression that it had exploded until last year, but this year the stability of the playing surface increased so that it was possible to continue the offensive.
For the world's top-notch peaches, it seems to have become a more bitter opponent.
Other than the two players, the results were made in the first round, but the Thai young Ace Canta fonts were the last Plannies B.
He was a three-player member of Unders Antonsen, a European tax.
Kantaphone does not have a crystallization at the top of the competition, but it has won the top by entering the top four in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18) who was able to rally with the top players, seems to have the potential to leap into the race at the Olympics.
In addition, Sai Plannies B. broke out one step away in India, where they had a single player.
Smir Barrama, Pranoy H.S., and Kega's late Surikans Kidbi are also coming up, and it is necessary to pay attention to the Indian system since the midfield.
In a new form of competition, the price is reduced by: Hokkaido Newspaper Copper Electronic Edition.
The new cost plan for a mobile phone company was launched in October with the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it almost stopped.
It was said that the Secretary of War had said that there was room for about 40% down, and the price competition did not occur, despite the growing expectations of the reduction.
The full-scale entry of Rakuten was delayed, and it was a major factor in the continuing river state of three major companies.
It is desirable for consumers to be a cost system that is easy to use.
I'd like to ask for their efforts.
The amended Act prohibits a set of terminals and communications.
Instead of allowing the device to be delivered or loaded, the communication volume was reduced.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the device the largest and the most expensive.
However, the "SIM Lock" is a device that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DoComo is the largest three-point terminal for all of its contractors.
The three companies also appear to continue to "extreme".
As for SIM Rock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy that required immediate repeal.
Companies must also respond quickly.
Rakuten's base station and other communications network were not planned.
It was hoped that it would be an anti-depressant of the Nesssage race, so it was a good idea to wear a cat.
Is there a sweetness of prospect?
There is no clear beginning or charge of full-scale services.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we need to be responsible for our business.
This commission led to the speech of Secretary of War.
The city complained about three new costs: "I think competition will begin in the future, and I don't think it's going to happen."
However, it is unlikely that the "determination" will drive the market and encourage a healthy competition.
The company should develop a customer's competition before being driven out of the government.
The charge system is very complex and is not easy to compare.
While the terminal had advertising such as "maximisation", consumers called attention as there were cases where the burden of consumers was higher than half.
Companies must be careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings.
Cash cards in Mie Prefecture

"The Rugby W Cup" is a one-shot "face-to-face risk tackle" by U.S. players – The ANSWER – Yahoo!
U.S. FL Cooke played a rough play, a former English representative (not a tackle).
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was held on 26 October, and the last United States to appear in 20 countries played a toast at 7-45 in England.
Although it became a black-and-white, the lyric play played byFL John Kyle later called the play.
They have a single face with a shoulder-necked face.
The actual scene is also released by foreign media, and the former English national player has stopped calling it "absolute and unbroken play".
"The video is an insulting and bitter play!"
More than one time, both players are disturbed ...
The hot investment exceeded the line.
It is a 29-minute walk from 0-38.
The enemy deeply defeated the English Prime Minister Farrell to catch a path.
He went to tackle it.
However, he did not leave his hips, but made a state, and he put his body in the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other and in a way that they turn.
Farrell was struck and collapsed.
He protested against the fact that he had written the legitimacy of the play with the English players.
Both players gathered at once and became air-conditioned.
As a result of TMO's "video judgment", the cowl is a single red card.
He left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the spectators asked him to play a fair.
The New Zealand local media "staff" is featured in the " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players are in a fierce play, and England is renamed".
Killer reported that he had a fierce shoulder charge on the face of the English star, and that he was "an overtook by almost all men".
In the article, he introduced comments from former English national player Hugo Monya.
"It's insulting, it's not called a grievances.
The game was played by one U.S., who managed to escape the game in an attempt to keep it in a minimum.
However, Kull's play left behind the poor.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare first published a 424 hospital named after 1455 public hospitals and two public hospitals on September 26.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health verified its effectiveness and the treatment of 14 public hospitals, and the National Hospital Organization of the City of Gyeonggiwa, the National Hospital of the State Hospital, the University of Sakai City Hospital The Oda Hospital in Echizen Town was the subject of four facilities: the Wakatakahama Hospital.
The four hospitals that were reorganised (the standard is funny).
Due to the aging of medical care, it was necessary to reorganize and consolidate hospitals in the competitive area.
In October, he called for a full-scale review of reorganisation and consolidation to the hospital, and by September next year he decided to make a decision.
There is no compulsory force, but due to the anxiety of a short hospital, local claims and repulsion of residents are expected.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The hospital had a relatively small number of hospitals.
By prefecture, Niigata (53,7 percent), Hokkaido (48,6 percent), Miyagi (47,5%), Yamaguchi (46,7%), and Okayama (43–3%).
The total number was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health investigated 1455 hospitals capable of dealing with "high acute" and "acutes" for serious patients, and "acutes" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, such as Gaya and emergency medical services, and that the competing hospitals were not in the "car within 20 minutes" location, and determined the need for public health.
The target hospital has to be considered for its abolition and some medical treatment to other hospitals.
Medical costs surged in 25 years, when all stages are over 75 years old.
As a result, the Ministry of Health aims to reduce the number of beds in a hospital in the nation by 140,000 beds.
Currently, there are a large number of beds for nurses, such as "high acute" and "acute", which require the elderly to have a high need for rehabilitation.
To cope with the aging population, it is necessary to not only reduce the number of beds but also increase rehabilitation.
With the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, the "regional medical concept" was formulated in 25 years by the nuclear department.
While the country is divided into 339 areas, municipalities and health officials compete, many of the local residents and claims maintain a cautious stance, and the debate is inexhaustible.
The Ministry of Health stated that it would lead to the activation of the debate by announcing a poor hospital name.

Pigs are the 9 recommended areas of the vaccine, the Gifu Newspaper Web - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issued an amendment to the Trade Guidelines, which would allow vaccinations to be immunised to pigs, which were not currently acknowledged, to prevent the spread of cholera.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boar infections are identified.
Transfers such as live pigs and fertilized eggs are limited to the region, but distribution of meat and processed goods is permitted.
After public comments (approvals) to the general public, he sought to complete the procedure as early as October.
The use of vaccines, and the recognition of illegal distribution such as meat, may result in a "normal country" that has been certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the September outbreak of last year, Japan was temporarily in reserve.
In an amendment, a brain injury set up a "vaccination recommended area" based on experts' opinion on areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The eligible prefectures create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the range, time, number, and direction of ingestion, and allow use in governor decisions.
The other seven areas of the recommended area are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, and Shiga.
The area determines the situation when the guidelines are modified.
Transfers such as ingested pigs, semen, fertilization, corpses, and wastes are restricted to the region in principle.
For meat and processed goods, they are not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the effects of farmers, and they accept the distribution of them effectively.
Because the virus does not spread, it thoroughly processes food waste.
He also sued for the safety of the ingested pigs and tried to prevent damage.
The amendment of the Guidelines was confirmed at a meeting of the Board of Trade and Counter-Terrorism.
In the future, the government will introduce opinions and public comments to the prefecture until 7 October to implement new trade guidelines.

The person who sent the "reverse offer" is a prestigious Manchester United.
Why did Honda have a great deal of requests for one of the Premier League's most competitive clubs?

The Australian media was named as a fresh candidate for Teco.
In the article, "The book's contract as a creative side player, rather than a house bus triker, can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
The nine goals for the 18-game title at the Melbourne Victory were "a brilliant record", which he noted: "The 33-year-old Honda must leave his entertainment to manage the Kampuchean delegation and gain full attention."

The Book of Mercy before Akutagawa's suicide was first published, and the literary theory of debilitity and dissonance | The Atession of the Shizuoka Newspapers
The mercy of Akutagawa Ryunosuke, who was first unveiled at the Tabata molecular village memorial, is the manuscript of the manuscript of the mercy of his son.

A total of 12 manuscripts of 200 manuscripts were published in the April 27 issue of The Literary Year.
Gulett Tuunberg (Why are the adults laughing for their children and doing so?)
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, she gave a speech to Swedish environmental activist Gulet Tuunberg on 23 September.
While his speeches have been noted, he has come out to be insulted by Gulett.
Greta Tuunbury, "Why are the adults laughing for their children?"
Political commentators said that he was "an mentally ill, used by parents and international leftists" on a television show in the United States, and that the television station was apologized.
Also in Japan, there are a number of sources that describe Gulettsan as "useless to go to school" and "received to the school", which are not the words of Guletta.
On September 26, Gulett wrote to her Twitter, "Why do the adults laugh at the teens and children and spend time on Odos?"
"I think I'm going to have a lie or conspiracy theory as long as I think."
According to Gulett, "We're going to start again, and as I'm aware, those who hate me are still active.
He pointed out that the adults did not want to face the climate or environmental crisis, but that they seemed to have a problem.
Why adults laugh at the teens and children and use time for Odos, to be honest, and I cannot understand them.
It would be another good at that time.
I feel that they are threatened.
But do not consume your time to pay more attention to them.

Changes have been made.
Even if adults like that change, they do not like it.

"The video came to Japan!"
Garcia's edge shots
I thought it would be a great deal, so I thought it would be late, but it was disappointing because it was not possible for Pater to go well.
Did you see the winner in the 6th Eagle, 7th Bardi?
After losing Boyy in the fourth place, the par5 remained, so if she was intrigued, the chip-in Eagle appeared on the sixth.
In the seventh edition, Bardi was given a chance, but it was disappointing that he did not go out later.
What do you get at the convention?
Because the "shot" tone was not good, it was good to keep it in a narrow course.
Laf was also a semi-finished and disobeyed course, so he studied very well because he had little "experience".
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera, such as a smartphone.
I didn't want to worry about it, but I thought it was a video for the gallery.
Although it was not unusual in the rest of the game, it was a competition with a few Japanese players, so I wanted to play the game with a feeling that I could not lose to overseas players.
I'm going to go to the second round, but I don't want to win more than one prize, so I'd like to win another, and I'll do my best to get to the top in that tournament.
Is there a way to prevent dementia?
We'd like to interview, write, and write.
A major pharmaceutical company and university hospital have tried to challenge research and development and have a setback in recognition.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been changed, and it has been shown that it may be highly inherited and may be forgotten.
He interviewed Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of the Center for Physicians at Kinki University Hospital.
There is no evidence of dementia.
It is hoped to prevent or treat dementia, but what is it?
It is possible that there may be some difference between the ages and severity.
However, it is thought that more than 20 years have been taken to develop new dementia drugs.
Drugs that are commonly used in Japan have already been out of insurance adaptation in some countries abroad, and are not expected to have significant recovery effects.
On the other hand, the death of infections and accidents has decreased, and the death of cancer has been reduced by significant advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
It is also true that the number of people with dementia has increased.
It is not possible to solve it by itself or by family, but as a whole it is necessary to create an environment where people can live safely in the area.
Let's forget it.
Is there a person who is vulnerable to dementia?
Even if the octahedron is inevitable, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and to "get away".
The dementia is considered to be one of the habitants of life, and tends to become more likely.
The metabolites tend to be prone to dementia.
The dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels.
It also affects economic power.
For example, in the United States, there is an area that distributes food tickets to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburg and pizza and chicken.
No gas or electricity can be used, and people who live in environments where food is not available.
As a result, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and proteins, and it becomes a lifestyle that relies on oil and sugar.
Eventually, the poor, but obese, and the only thing to do is to see TV as a daze, and the body becomes futile.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
Other people who do not think of things tend to be more susceptible to dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is not metabolites, and it is necessary to read books regularly.
