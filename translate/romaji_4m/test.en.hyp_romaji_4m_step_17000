It is dangerous to drive.
"Auto Messe Web" - Yahoo!
It is a violation of the Road Traffic Act.
It has been noted for the increasing number of self-assesssment reports, such as pedal failure, but it is a major mistake to think that it is a problem for older drivers.
According to the 2015 report, the most common age is 1080, which is over 75 years old.
It is important to note that this is not the case with older people, and it is important to call attention to the young.
How do you feel comfortable?
Are you safe?
Although there is no evidence of either sex or cause of this data, it is not uncommon for older people to feel that they are often driving skills or reflectors, and in youths, they may also be misguided due to other things, such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heel, panps, sandals, mulls, and the day they wear.
Some people know that it's not going to work, but others don't think it's going to be dangerous.
However, driving in high-heeled and sandals is restricted to road traffic.
The first is Article 70, which defines "the operation of the steering wheel, the brake, and the other operations of the operation" and "not the driving of the accident and harming the person".
The other is Article 71, which states that the driver must adhere to the matters set by the Nuclear and Du Fuken Safety Committee, for example, the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, which prevents a certain type of vehicle (except for driving) in order to prevent further operations.
The same is the case for the driver to be considered a breach of driving in the "disturbation of driving" even before he does not specify that he is a high heel.
Why is it dangerous to drive?
It is clear to consider the basics of pedal operations.
For safety-real pedal operations, the leg can be fixed on the floor, and the leg is vertical to the brake pedal, and the leg is tilted to the right as a point of view when it is on the Axel pedal.
It is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of its behavior.
However, in the high heel, the size of the kakat is small, and the length of the legs is always narrow, and the height of the heel has an angle to the whole leg, so the area of the foot in the pedals cannot be properly adjusted.
It is thought to be dangerous.
Most of the cars have floor carpets, but this material is easily scratched, and the pedals are not put in the elbows, such as the Isabelle brake, and the back of the pedals may be removed.
In addition, there is also a case that when the pedals are pushed back, the elbow is pulled behind the pedal, and the Axel pedals cannot return.

On 26 September, the Ministry of Health announced a 424 hospital named after the public hospital of 1455, as well as a two-seat public hospital.
In Fukui Prefecture, there were four facilities in the city of Wakasahahama Hospital, a public hospital, and a public hospital 14 facility.
It is a four-member hospital, which is a standard.
It was an unusual response, as it was necessary to reorganize and consolidate hospitals in the competitive area, due to increased medical costs.
In October, he requested a full-fledged review of the merger and reorganisation of the hospital, and by September, he decided to conclude.
There is no force, but the fear of the lack of a short hospital is expected to cause local claims and opposition to the population.
The meeting was held on the same day.
The hospital had a total of 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
In the prefecture, the percentage was higher in Niigata (53–70%), Hokkaido (48–6 percent), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43.3%).
It was the largest in the world, with 54 being the only one in Okinawa.
The Ministry of Health, Inc., based on data from 2017, investigated 1455 hospitals that are capable of treating "high altitude" for patients with serious injuries, and "acute" in general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including Garner and emergency medical equipment, and whether a competitor's hospital was in a "car-by-car" location.
The hospital is subject to consideration for the removal of some medical practitioners and the transfer of some medical practitioners to other hospitals.
The total cost of the hospital is 25 years.
For this reason, the U.S. Department of Health has a goal of reducing the number of beds in a hospital to 19,000 beds.
Currently, there is a large number of "high-grade" beds for nursing care and medical care, while older adults lack the need for rehabilitation.
It is not only necessary to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and consolidate the hospital, a "regional medical concept" was established in 25 years, with each department establishing the number of beds required by the department.
Although it is divided into 339 regions, municipalities and medical professionals compete, many of the local residents and claims maintain the city's height, and the debate is over.
The Ministry of Health has stated that it is necessary to activate the debate by releasing a poor hospital name.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issued a revised version of the trade guidelines for the prevention of the spread of livestock epidemics (boiled pigs) on 27 January to prevent infection.
The target area has nine selections, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boar infection are identified.
The transfer of living pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the area, but the distribution of meat and processed goods is permitted.
It is considered to be a public opinion, and as early as mid-October, the procedure is completed.

Since the end of September, the country has been in a temporary position.
In the revised version, the cytokine set the vaccine recommended area for areas where the risk of infection from wild boar to pigs is high.
The prefecture is subject to the creation of a "vaccination program" consisting of the range of ingestion, timing, head count, and direction, which is confirmed by the Ministry and allows the use of it by the governor.
The other seven areas that rise to the recommended area include Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the rules are changed, the situation is determined again.
The movement of the ingested pigs, fertilized eggs, corpses, and urns is restricted to the area as a consequence.
For meat and processed products, they do not take into account the cost of distribution restrictions and the effects of farmers, and are effectively acceptable for distribution.
The virus does not diffuse, so it is essential to treat food waste.
It is also used to promote the safety of pigs and to prevent damage.
The revised draft was held at the same meeting of experts on the same day.
In the future, the city's public and public comments were held until 7 October, when a new trade guide was introduced.
