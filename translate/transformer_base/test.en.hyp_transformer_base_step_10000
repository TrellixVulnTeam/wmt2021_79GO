Driving with high heel is dangerous!
The wrong accident on the pedal of the youth (Automatic Web) - Yahoo! News
Road traffic law conflicts with the violation act.
It's a big mistake to think that it's only an elderly driver's problem, although it is attracting more attention due to false operation.
In the case of a period of time, the number of accidents occurred in the National Police Agency (2015), many times have been more than 24 years old and more than 1032 cases over 75 years.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation.
Do you take the oshale of your feet?
Do you take safety?
This data does not contain gender ratios or causes, but the elderly who are considered to be often due to the failure of the body, such as driving skills and reflective nerves, etc. are also considered to be a mistake of taking care of other things, such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by high heel, pans, sandals, mule and day clothes, and drive as it is.
There are some people who know it is not suitable for driving, but they do not think that they may lead to danger.
However, driving in heel and sandals is in conflict with road traffic law.
One is to ensure the operation of the handles, brakes, and other operations, and Article 70, which stipulates that the accident must not be operated to harm the person, Article 70.
Furthermore, in accordance with the Act on Road Traffic Law of Miyazaki Prefecture, there is no mention that the driver must comply with the matters set by the Committee of Public Security of each prefecture.
The purpose of each prefecture is to assume a violation of the "brain" operation, even until it does not specify the high heel.
Why is the driving in the heel dangerous?
It is clear to consider the basics of pedal operation safely.
For a safe pedal operation, first fixing the foot or foot on the floor, and putting the foot to be vertical against the brake pedal.
At this time, it is important to be firmly fixed so that the car does not change regardless of the behavior.
However, the high heel has a small area that is attached to the floor, and it always has graphs and brushes, and has an angle across the foot at the heel height.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have a floor carpet, but this material is easy to move the heel to the depth of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where heel moves back to the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is gone back.

The decline in housing market conditions and the damage caused the earthquake, which affected the deterioration of consumer roofs.

The company has been established in June 1895 (Meiji 28) and has changed its corporate structure in April 1961.
At the beginning of this project, we started business as a manufacturer of tiled tiles, which is a local industry in Awaji Island.
In October 1986, the company was transferred to the main office to the present site, as well as the merger of the Co-operatives and the business of the Kinki industry.
After that, Fujiyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc. have established a sales base for the current system.
The company has built a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies and rooftop contractors.
As the top tile manufacturer of Awaji Island, it was well known.
However, due to the decline in housing prices since the Lehman shock, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, the demand for consumer roofs increased due to the earthquake and tsunami.
In addition to a decline in interest rates due to a surge in fuel prices, excess debts associated with inventory and business fixed investment have been forced to make severe money.
For this reason, the financial institutions requested the repayment conditions of loans to financial institutions to reconstruct their business conditions.
We abandoned our business continuity and took this action.
The debt is currently under investigation but is about 20 billion yen.

New Fees for Mobile: Hokkaido Shimbun
The new rates of mobile phone companies due to the enactment of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was largely high.
Despite the growing expectation of price decline, the price competition was not expected.
It is a major factor that the full entry of Rakuten will be sent forward and the oligoth of three major companies continues.
For consumers, it is desirable to be a price system that is easy to use.
I would like to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The revised Act prohibits the set-off of the device and the communication fee.
Instead of selling the device, the communication fee was set to be more expensive.
SOFTBANK and KDDI (au) have announced a plan to maximize and halve the device.
However, the two companies will also use the SIM lock, which is not allowed to use the other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will maximize the number of terminal owners.
The three companies will continue to "close" to prevent transfers to other companies.
Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications decided to immediately cancel.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not allowed to develop the telecommunications network, such as the base station, as planned.
It was only expected that it would be a lower competition explosive, but it was a good match.
Perhaps there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and price of full-scale services has not been revealed.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, we want to work on our business.
The price was revised by Mr. Sugabo.
Mr. Suga complained about the new price of three companies, "I think that competition will start in the future."
However, the government's lower price is not allowed to create a sound competition.
The corporate side should expand the customer's competition before it comes to the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not allowed to compare.
The consumer office called attention as a result of a consumer's burden exceeding half.
In order to avoid the misconception of users, companies must carefully and understand the content on their website.

Many local residents and the heads of the chiefs maintain a cautious attitude, although they are divided into 339 areas throughout the country and consultations with local governments and medical officials.

Today's Best Shot
One W shots are not necessarily beat.
When I want to make a ball on the ground when I want to get a distance in the second quarter of Perth.
The last oneW has a large head volume, with the risk of the ball dissipation, but there are players who often practice this on the ground.

The age of 24 in the seventh year is 166cm in height, while the driving diversion department is currently 7th (average 304.02 yd).
While focusing on long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In the spring, I thought I would like to try to do the right do not because the shot of the spoon (3W).
From the training round to the grass in the Ti area, the ball is poultry, and can also shake one W.

In the first half of the year, I thought that I could go to the second half, but because the patern did not work well.
I could win the championship at the Eagle No. 6 and 7 bardy.
Even after I took the 4 o'clock, I left five, so I had a feeling of reimbursing.
I was able to catch the bardy at 7 o'clock, but it was regrettable that I could not reach the second half.
What I got in the tournament now?
Because I didn't have to do so recently, I was glad that Fairway was able to make a good key even in a narrow course.
There was no experience, so I learned a lot because I didn't have a lot of experience.
The difference between the regular tournaments.
I think it is possible to shoot a camera such as a smartphone.
I didn't have to worry about it, but the gallery had a lot of videos.
