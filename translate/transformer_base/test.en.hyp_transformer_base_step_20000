Driving with high heel is dangerous!
Auto Messe Web - Yahoo! News
Violence of road traffic law
It's a big mistake to think that it's only a problem with older drivers.
In the number of cases of false incidents by age (2015 data by the National Police Agency), the number of cases with fewer than 24 years of age was 1080, and the number of cases with fewer than 1032 cases over the age of 75.
It is important for young people to call for the same attention.
Do you take a look at your feet?
Do you take safety?
This data does not include gender-to-man ratios and causes, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the deterioration of the body, such as driving skills and reflective nerves, it can also be considered a mistake due to the misrepresentation of music and conversation in young people, or the misrepresentation of clothes.
In particular, women choose to wear high-heel, breadth, sandals, mulls, and shoes, and then run them.
While some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is difficult to change their shoes.However, there are many people who do not think of the possibility of leading to dangerous situations.
However, driving with high heel and sandals is inconsistent with road traffic.
The first is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations.
Another statement is that, in Article 71 of which the driver shall comply with the conditions stipulated by each prefectural Public Security Committee, for example, in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Act on Enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Law, the operator shall not use the shoes in a manner that prevents the operation of the vehicle, slippers, slippers, high-heel, or any other driving operation, and shall not operate the vehicle (excluding light vehicles).
In each prefecture, it is similar to the intention of a violation of the driving force at the "a footwear that may prevent the operation of the vehicle" until it does not specify "high heel".
Why is driving at high heel dangerous?
It's obvious if you consider the basics of riding safely.
To ensure safe pedal operation, the foot or foot should be fixed on the floor, and the foot should be vertical against the brake pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly in place to ensure that the car does not behave properly.
However, in high heels, the area of the heel is small, and the area of the heel is always blurred, and the heel height has an angle to the entire foot, so the area of the heel is small, and the fine adjustment is hard.
This could lead to danger.
In addition, there are floor carpets in most cars, but this material makes it easy to move between high heel or heel, and when it is sudden brake, heel is pulled and the pedal is not stepped into it.
In addition, there is a case in which heel is pulled behind the pedal and the accelerator pedal cannot be returned.

What is the image of "shape" overlaps with the beautiful girls of Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!
The mysterious beauty and the expression of the shadows are common.
Since the 1950s, many works have been released to the world.
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo's work.
[Image ] Because "shadow" is attractive.
A Beautiful Girl of the Works of Kazuo Umezu
In the preface of the "Family Collection" there was a statement that "the beauty of the women in contrast to the horror, ugliness, the shocking scenes of the story, and the development of the story."However, the expression of the grudge in which the beautiful face was distorted and angry ... may be more "feelful".
The word "shape" is the key words that appear in many of the works of Kazuo Ume, but snakes are captured by the viewer as "excessive creatures" or "beauty" people who feel beautiful.
Some people like reptiles in the world.
Thus, according to the viewer's sensibilities, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "shape."
In addition, this creature has been revered as a spiritual creature since ancient times.
His work on the subject of the "shape" is a series of "Tobi-girls" in 1965, and "Yatsura-girls".
It is a beautiful woman with a shadow.
I wonder if it's a "coolbusty" type if you say it's a bad way of saying ... I think that's the same thing among the beautiful girls who appear in my work.
In particular, "Orochi", the protagonist of the series "Orouchi" which was serialized in "The Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of the work of the plum illustration.However, in order to maintain the eternal life and the eternal youth, there is a deep sleep every 100 years.

According to a survey conducted by NPOs, approximately 3700 activities were conducted throughout Japan this year.
Compared to the previous year, it has increased by 1-6 times, and there are also 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture.
Why is it a child cafeteria now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, President of the NPO, and social activist, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture at Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging population, the region becomes lonely, and the shopping district also declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
Therefore, it was necessary to establish an exchange hub for people and people to interact with each other.
Even though it is a child cafeteria, it is a "multi-generational zone" where elderly people come together.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also leads to child rearing and elderly health.
Cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
The most important thing is to make children from there.
From one per month to one daily meal.
There are a wide variety of venues, ranging from several to hundreds of people, to individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere of people who want to do is growing.
The low quality of the room is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
We may also hear issues such as safe management systems.
"By connecting with society becomes a safety net for disasters," Yuasa says.
It looks like a light of hope for a closed society.

"In recent years, Iran's drones used in this bombing have significantly improved their performance by analyzing the drones of the US military who had been crashing.
It is possible to manufacture at low cost, and it is about 1,000km long.
It's not easy to capture the radar because it's flying low-air."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, Fushi, announced a statement of the offense.
"It's certainly true that President Rouhani is in the midst of the Fushi faction, Iran is not allowed to invest in Saudi Arabia's crude oils in a situation where their country cannot export crude oils." (Mr. Sugawara, International Political Analyst)
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production had stopped, and crude oil prices rose 15%.
Some say that oil shock will come again.
"I would like to avoid military interventions until at least next year's elections are overjoring the US Army's withdrawal from the Middle East, and Iran will continue to hold a drone bomb to cover the Fushi faction, but the US will not be able to endure forever." (Mr. Sugawara)

The reason why YouTuber was a positive employee.
I asked the president who was hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Friday) 8:47
It's a very popular YouTuber with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to take advantage of their products as advertising, there are some companies that have begun a unique mechanism of adopting YouTuber as a regular employee.
This is a direct marketing mix (DmMiX), which focuses on corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
How do I use YouTuber?
As a representative of DmMiX, I interviewed Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, a representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism do you use YouTuber?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter, "Kobayashi") : The profession of YouTuber is a dream of many young people.
In the future, the number of young people who are looking for will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted young people who are chasing the dream of Bandman and comedians.
In the same way, a young man who chases his dream of becoming a YouTuber is adopted by YouTuber.
Why did you decide to hire?
Kobayashi: While many young people are eager to work on YouTuber, most of the YouTubers are unlikely to be able to generate their profits.
There are many creators who work in part-time and are making videos and postings, as well as creators who don't accept the existence of YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide creators with an environment for salary and content production.
At first, we will support our efforts by supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber.

Cherry shrimp in the process of growing|Shizuoka Shimbun
This year's Sakura shrimp, which was successfully filmed in the deep sea of Suruga Bay, was born on 11th, Kabahara Oki, Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka.
As a result, the Yuhi Sakura shrimp project of the Marine Industry Cluster Council of Shizuoka City and other industrial and academic sectors succeeded in photographing cherry shrimp, which was likely to be born during the spring summer spawning season of this year.
The process of growth is very valuable, and the people involved are trying to elucidate the ecology of cherry shrimps.
The photo was taken about 1/5 km off the sea floor of Kabaru, Shimizu-ku, Tokyo.
In 17 minutes, about 300 were confirmed.
During the day, Sakura shrimp in the deep sea was once again backed up by the traditional knowledge of "the seabed has formed a certain number of flocks."
The adult body is about 40 millimetres long, and about 23 mm long.
We have identified the spawning period by comparing the seasonal data of freshly fried cherry shrimp.
The detailed analysis will be submitted to Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Institute of Technology.
Keisuke Mizuno, Project Leader, says, "I want to capture the lives of people in the growing process, including Japanese shrimp."

【The first half of the Bado Olympic Race】 Kento Momoda, the world's champion, and Kento Shuten, who's strong, lead a step ahead!
<Men's singles>
The Japan National Team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Swis Basel) held in August, will participate in China's OPP (Seishu/Super1000), which will be opening on September 17.
Here, we will look back on the first half of the Olympic race to be held in Tokyo next year from May to August, and look forward to the men's singles for the mid-stage (September 12).
The Badominton Olympic race began in May and ended the world championship, and the top players competed in the top four races (with over 500 players).
In the first half of the game, Kento Momota, who won the 2nd prize in the fourth competition, and Shuten Cheng in Taiwan.
Taoda won the World Championships and Zhou Tensei in Indonesia's OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also has the JapanOP (S750).
The competition was held in May in the SDF World Cup (May, China), the Indonesian OP (July 16 results) and the JapanOP (July ) and the World Championship (August).
Although the number of other top players is smaller than other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on their bodies.
It was only one of the World Championships in August.
It is necessary to make a good result in the mid-term battle where the top-level tournaments from September will continue.
Taiwan's ace that is strong in the battle.
It's great for young Thais!
He also won the top championship in Indonesia's OP and Thailand's OP (S500), where he competed in 7 races.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the championship.
Originally, the fiscal was strong, and he was not struggling with the fight.
Even after the competition, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming competition by earning high points in the first half of the game.
Until last year, however, it was difficult to find a strong explosion, but this year, when the player's stability increased, he was able to continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, it's likely to be a tougher partner.
In addition to the first half of the game, the result was the young Thai ace Kantaphone and Cy Pranith B. .
He is a three-star Unders Antonsen, who is struggling with a lonely army as a European.
Despite the fact that it is not only going into the final at the top of the competition, but it also has the power to win the top of the competition.
Although there are still a lot of rough faces, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18) who can rally against top players is likely to have a great chance of leaping in the Olympic race.
Sir Pranys B. also stepped out in India, where he had a good player in singles.
As Samir Balama, Prairie H.S ., and Sricans Kidambi, who are late at Kega, will also be caught up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new plan for mobile phone companies was released.
However, it was generally high.
In the last summer, Mr. Yoshihide Suga stated that there was room to reduce by about 40 percent, and despite the growing expectations for price reduction, price competition had not occurred.
One of the major factors is the fact that the full-scale entry of Rakuten has been postponed, and three major companies continue to be oligos.
It is desirable for consumers to be fair and affordable.
I would like to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits set discounts for terminal and communications charges.
Instead of selling the device, it was decided that the telecommunications fee would be more expensive.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to 50%.
However, for the 100-day period between the two companies, SIM locks, which can be used by other companies.
NTT Docomo will set up to one-third of the device's subscription to only its subscribers.
The three companies continue to "enclose" to prevent transfers to other companies.
Regarding SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated that it would be mandatory for immediate release.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was due to the lack of the provision of the base station and other networks as planned.
As it was expected to be a booster in the competition of lowering the value, it was a cool look.
Is there a sweet outlook?
The start of the full-scale service is not clear.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work with responsibility.
This year's price revision was initiated by Mr. Suga.
Mr. Suga said, "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's going to be like this."
However, it seems that the "reduction of government-made prices" will help the market to achieve sound competition.
Companies should be able to compete in customer-oriented competition before they come out of government.
The pricing system of each company is very complicated and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency has called for attention to the fact that the consumer's burden is above the half-price, while the device is advertising such as "maximum half-price."
Companies should be careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misinterpretation of users.

【 Rugby World Cup】 One Outage & Scrupulous Fighting U.S. players "Faceless Tackle" Overseas Waves "A Horny Play" ( THE ANSWER) - Yahoo!
The US FLkle is a rough play, and the former British representative, "Don't call Tackle."
The World Cup (W Cup) was held in England on 26th.
Although he became a black star, he called a wave of rough play which was performed by FLJohn Kyle later.
A one-off place like adding a shoulder tuckle on the face of the opponent.
The real scene was also released with video from overseas media, and the former British national team said, "The insult and the poor play."
【Video】 "A Horny and Horny Play" and foreign crest!
The real moment of the "Faceless Tackle" played by the U.S. representative Kuyle.
Hot struggles were over one line.
It's 29 minutes after we arrived at 0-38.
Farel, a British captain, was a bit depressed when he caught his path.
I went to Tackle.
However, it was not from the waist, but the upper body was violent.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other.
Farel was blown away and fell.
He protested that England was trying to blow the Quyle in a play that was obviously lacking the rightness.
The two men gathered together at once and became the air of an instant.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), the Cile is a red card and a red card.
After the pitch with a bad face, some of the spectators asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, who is strong in rugby, is featured in the headlines: "The Rugby World Cup 2019: the U.S. player quits in a sleek play, and the England win."
"Kill was a poor shoulder charge on the face of Farel, a British star."
In the article, Mr. Wugo Moña, a former British national and commentator.
"It's an insult, and it's not a tuckle, it's a poor play," he said.
The U.S., who lacked one in the game, was forced to leave the game at 81 minutes.
However, the play of the quail has left the evil aftertaste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced on September 26 that it was the first to announce the names of 424 public hospitals in Japan, including 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MOTI) has confirmed the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.The four facilities were targeted at the National Hospital of Awara Hospital, Yanai City.
⇒Reorganization of the four hospitals "Criteria Fun"
In order to reduce the amount of medical expenses to be expanded due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate with hospitals in the competitive region.
In October, we will ask for a full-scale review of the reorganization and integration of the affected hospital.
Although there is no force to be forced, there is a possibility that the local mayors and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that the nearby hospital will be lost.
It was announced at the meeting of the same day.
The number of beds was relatively small.
According to prefectures, Niigata (53, 7 %), Hokkaido (48, 6 %), Miyagi (47, 5 %), Yamaguchi (46, 7 %), and Okayama (43, 3 %).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one in Okinawa.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, based on the data in FY2017, investigated the "Advanced acute phase" for serious patients and 1455 hospitals for general surgery.
He analyzed nine clinical trials, such as cancer and emergency medicine, as well as the location of a competing hospital within 20 minutes by car, and determined the need for publication of the hospital name.
In the hospital, some of the medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
The medical expenses will increase in the last 25 years, when all of the group members are 75 years old.
As a result, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of beds of 124,06 thousand beds in 18 years.
At present, the number of beds in the "Advanced acute phase" and "Acute stage," which require medical expenses, is high, while the elderly are in need of high rehabilitation.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary to reduce the number of beds, but also increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate the hospital, we have developed a "local medical plan" which sets the number of beds required by each prefecture for 25 years.
While local governments and medical professionals have been discussing each country in 339 areas, many of the local residents and seniors have maintained their cautious attitudes, and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MOTIE) has announced the lack of track record-breaking hospital names to encourage discussion.

Food and Rural Areas - Yahoo! News
On July 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MOFA) announced the amendment to the Anti-Proliferation Guideline for Preventive Vaccination of Porks, which are not currently accepted.
The target region will select 9 prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild wild boars.
The transfer of living pigs and fertilised eggs is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is deemed to be outside the region.
After a public comment (appropriate call) to the general public, we plan to complete the procedure in October.
By using vaccines and accepting the distribution of meat from outside the region, it is no longer a "pure country" approved by international organizations, and it is possible to influence the export of pork.
Since September last year, Japan has been on hold.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries).
The target prefectures have created the vaccine vaccination program, which includes the range of vaccinations, periods, heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures are recommended for vaccination.
The region will review the situation when the guideline was revised.
Transfers such as inoculated pigs, cums, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, etc. are generally limited to the region.
For meat and processed products, it is not targeted at the cost of distribution and the influence of farmers, and it is accepted to be distributed outside the region.
In order to prevent virus from spreading, we will treat food waste.
It also appeals to the safety of pigs that were vaccinated, and prevents harmful rumors.
The amendments to the guideline were summarized at the meeting of the Advisory Council on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Proliferation Division.
In the future, the Government of Japan will conduct public comments and opinions on the prefectures until October 7 and implement new guidelines for the prevention of the disease.
An open approach to Keisuke Honda and ManU.
"You don't need money" (Channel) - Yahoo!News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57
As far as last year, he left Melbourne Victory in Australia's A League, and now, Keisuke MF Honda, a former Japanese nationalist who has no choice but to take an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, who was actually playing.
The truth of the sky is revealed.
"You don't need money, but you need to play with a great team and a great team of teammates."
The one who sent "reverse offer" is a world-famous Manchester United.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most prestigious clubs in the Premier League?
This article was published on the Australian edition FOX Sports.
Among the five FWs that Manchester United might be able to grasp in the aftermath of the injury, five players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bony, Honda was named.
Currently, in United, MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malshar, FW Marcus Rushford and others have been injured, and they are in an emergency.
The "red devil" led by Olle Gunner Sulsheril was forced to slide in 2 wins and 22 defeats in the league.
That's why I named the Australian media as a new candidate for Tecos.
In the article, the contract of Honda as a creative side player, rather than a striker, can fill holes buried by Andreas Pera.
He said, "The 33-year-old Honda needs to leave his pleasure in managing the Cambodian representative, and attract full attention."
Is the Honda's approach?
For the next year's Tokyo Olympic Games, we're looking forward to seeing how the United will move.
Completion of 500 Mobile Translation Machines | Shizuoka Shimbun at ES
Poketalk is a portable translation machine that is free of charge to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On February 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it has completed a total of 500 units to be installed in Hamamatsu City.
It is noted that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the same translation system in the same region, leading to an increase in the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The number of lenders is 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations and 134.
The city occupies 60%.
We started to show the lenders to the Google Maps app, so we could see the location of a foreign language store on our smartphone.
You can access Hamana Lake from tourist sites.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city to receive the "Japan's Most Inbound Support City Hamamatsu".
The two-year lease of the Chamber of Commerce will be available to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the conditions of the purchase of 500 units.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We would like to connect to the development of new foreign customers in the midst of the harsh business environment."
Ikemura Kanyo, who is now Naodra, doesn't need to pay for the first time?
Caddy's Best Shot
1W shot isn't always ticking.
There is also a technique called "director" that allows you to put a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second of the par 5.
The recent 1W has a large head volume, and there is a risk of the ball being scattered, but there are players who frequently practice it on the ground.
It is Kansei Ikemura, who is waiting for the first time in the tour.
The age of 24 in the 7th year is 166 cm in height, and currently ranked 7th in the Driving Disstance Division (an average of 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was Fairwaywood's precision.
"I don't have a shot of a spoon (3W) in spring, so I'd like to try a doll."
From the practice round, I put the ball on top of the grass in the area.
In the case of a big carry, there is a lot of tiup, but the two sides are making use of the direct dora in narrow halls.
"You can use a hole that will break down."
He recorded 270yd 280yd by Carrie.
"That's why I don't have 3W.
From "Japan Tour Championship" in June, only 1W of wood in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 UT.
I am also happy to hear from my fellow tour mates who are surprised by the fact that they are leaking from the gallery they see.
The trick is to "make the club level."
"Even if you hit down blow, you can't fly straight, even if you hit the upper, even if you're in the lower position, you're going to the right, when you're in the cut track, you're going to do a direct dora to correct the swing of a 1W shot.
The ball isn't captured and the risk of slices is "so the left side can be removed (no song left)".
It's a professional skill that I can't imagine.

"I want to think of as far as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
Ms. Greta said, "You know, it started again, and as you notice, those who hate me are still active, following my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and the place where I am different from the human being, they come up with a lie and conspiracy theory that can be considered."
They pointed out that they didn't want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be talking about.

Wedge Shot in Garcia
I was able to reach a certain level in the first half of the year, so I thought that I could go through the momentum of the second half.
I saw the sixth Eagle, the 7th Bardy.
Even after I hit Boggy in 4th, I still had 5 laps, so if I had a feeling of returning, I got a chip-in Eagle at 6.
I was able to win the second half of the race.
What did you get in this tournament?
I was glad that I could keep the fairway in a narrow course because I didn't have a lot of time.
Because the rough and reverse eye were different, the distance was changed.
What's the difference?
It's possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming a lot of galleries.
I haven't changed much more than anything else, but since there are few Japanese players in the co-host, I decided to come to the match with the feeling that I won't lose anyone from outside Japan.
I'm going to follow the second half of the race, but if I don't win one or more, I'd like to win another win, and there's also the ZOZO Championship in the near future, so I'm going to work hard to get the top prize.
What is the way to prevent dementia from becoming dementia?
Media/文/WATANABE/YAN
A major pharmaceutical company and university hospital have failed to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and living habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be kept in extremely light diseases and the degree of forgottenness.
Kinki University Hospital Dr. Shunsuke Otsuki, Department of Neuroscience, Graduate School of Engineering, Kinki University.
There is no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: The difference between mild to severe conditions can be attributed to dementia.
However, it is thought that it takes more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries around the world, Dnepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance and is not expected to be effective.
On the other hand, fatalities due to infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer mortality has decreased due to aggressive progression of anti-cancer drugs.
Therefore, the number of patients with dementia has increased.
It is not possible to solve it by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment where people can live in peace as a whole.
How to keep in the degree of forgetting.
Is there a person who is prone to dementia?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, there is a possibility that the symptoms can be kept as low as possible, and the degree of forgetting things.
It is thought that dementia is one of the lifestyle-related diseases.
First, metabo people tend to be dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of living habits.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.
The presence or absence of economic power will also affect.
For example, in the U.S., there is a region where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets can be purchased by food tickets.
People living in environments where gas and electricity cannot be used.
After that, it becomes a diet with little vegetables and protein quality, and it becomes a life of fat and sugar.
As a result, poverty becomes obese.
Similar situations can be seen in Japan.
In addition, there is a tendency for people who don't think about things or don't work to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things in a daily manner.
