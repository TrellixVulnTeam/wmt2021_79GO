Why is it dangerous to drive at high speed?
It is clear to consider the basics of the pedal operation to be safe.
For a safe pedal operation, the feet are fixed on the floor, and the feet are placed vertically against the brake pedals, and the foot is tilted to the right when the axel pedal is applied.
At this time, it is important to keep the car in a safe position, regardless of its behavior.
However, in high-heel, the area of the ground floor is small, always graffling with graffles, and the height of the heel is angled to the foot, so that the area of the pedal is too small, and the fine tuning is less difficult.
This can lead to danger.
Most of the cars have a floor carpet, but this material is easy to move between high-heel and high-heel, and when the heel is pulled out of the brakes, the heel is removed from the heel's pitch, and the pedal is not stuck in the pedal.
In addition, when the pedal is pushed back, the heel moves backwards to the side of the pedal, and the axel pedal is not restored.
