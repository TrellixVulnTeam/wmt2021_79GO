Driving with high heels is dangerous!
Auto Messe Web - Yahoo! News
Violation against road traffic law
It has been noted that there is an increase in reports of accidents caused by malfunctions such as pedal mistakes, but it is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
In the number of occurrences of age-based pedal mistakes, the number of incidents occurred in 2015 (the National Police Agency's data) was more than 1080 cases under the age of 24.
It is important for young people to call attention the same way.
Take the reins of the foot?
Take safety?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are considered to be often due to the deterioration of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, young people can also think of mistakes caused by music and conversation.
In particular, women may choose to wear high heels, panps, sandals and mules, and choose various shoes depending on the day's clothing and drive as they are.
Some people say that it is difficult to change their footwear while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the potential to lead to danger at all.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the road traffic law.
"We will ensure that we operate the handle, brakes and other operations," Article 70 "Safety Driving Obligations" which stipulates that "we shall not drive to harm the people who cause accidents."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters set forth by the Prefectural Public Safety Commission.For example, Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act states that the vehicle (except light vehicles) should not be operated in a manner that prevents the operation of the vehicle, with the footwear, slippers, tights, high-heels, etc.
The aim of each prefecture is to assume a violation of "a footwear that can prevent operation" until it is not specified as high heels.
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is clear to think about the basics of making pedal operations safe.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, the foot is first fixed to the floor, then the foot is placed vertically against the brake pedal, and the foot is tilted to the right as a starting point when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly in place so that the car does not behave.
However, in high heels, the area of the toes is small, and the area of the toes is always graffiti, and the angle of the toes at the height of the heels makes the area of the toes smaller, making it difficult to make fine adjustments.
This can lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull high heels, such as rapid brakes, where heels can not be pulled and pedals can not be stepped, and high heels can be removed from the heel's heel's hooked beat and unable to step behind the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where heels are pulled back to the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedal was no longer returned.

At least 18,000 people in three consecutive years in the United States and refugee acceptance framework | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Washington] The U.S. Department of State announced on October 26, 2020 that it would reduce the number of refugees from all over the world to 18,000 in the fiscal year 2020 (October 19 to September 20).

Geotechnical industry in Awaji Island, Hyogo Prefecture, Kinki ceramics manufactured by Awaji tiles filed for quasi-self bankruptcy debt of about 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
The decline in the housing market and the repeated damage to the earthquake affected the progress of "consumer tile roofing."
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporate Code: 530173983, 992 million yen in capital, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative Yukizo Fukuhara and 44 employees) filed for quasi-insolvency on August 30.
The application agent was Daichi Yoshida, 1-10-8 Nishi Tenman, Kita-ku, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, and Daichi Yoshida, Tel 06-6365-6038.
The company was founded in June 1895 and was reorganized into a tile manufacturer in April 1961.
At the beginning, he started his business as a manufacturer of Ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishi-Awaji City, Mihara-gun, Japan.
In October 1986, the Kyowa-gama Co., Ltd.'s absorption merger and the Kinki-industrial Co., Ltd.'s business was inherited.
Since then, the company has established sales offices in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc. and has become the current system.
In the fiscal year ended December 2004, the company established a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction companies, and roof construction companies.
As the top tile manufacturer of Awaji Island, it was well-known.
However, due to the sluggish housing market since the Lehman shock and the repeated disasters such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand has been growing, and the annual sales volume for the fiscal year ended December 2018 has fallen to approximately 134.5 million yen.
In terms of revenue, in addition to the decline in profit margin due to fuel price hikes, there was a continuous deficit with excessive interest in inventory and business fixed investment.
For this reason, financial institutions were seeking repayment conditions for repayment of loans, etc., but there was no signs of recovery in business conditions and the financial situation was gradually tightening.
I came here and gave up my business continuity and this was my step.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

I was able to respond gradually in early June.
"The number of things I can do every day has increased and I can do one thing every day."
There was trial and error, but by challenging the hypothesis one after another, the situation rose significantly and the results were also better.
"I was thrown into the list of injured people throughout the year."
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it.I'm going to talk to agents and families."

When you take a look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of your work.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
A beautiful woman in her works (5 pieces)
In the beginning of the "Girl's Collection", there was a statement that "frightness, uglyness, shocking scenes and deployments of stories can be distinguished by the beauty of the girls in the opposite direction."
There is a keyword "snake" in the works that appear many times in the picture, but there are a variety of people who see snakes as "snake creatures" or who feel "beautiful".
Some people love reptiles in the world, and others say they are not good at it.
Thus, the "beauty" and "ugliness" may be the "snake" of the creatures in the lining.
In addition, this creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" resides is auspicious.
In his works, he has a series of "Mama Kowai!" in 1965, "Abi Girl" and "A Little Girl".

Is it nice to say that it is "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is in common with the beautiful girls appearing in the picture.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be a representative figure of the work.

"Ababy, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the crashed US drones.
It is inexpensively manufactured and the range is approximately 1000 km.
"It is also a strength that is difficult to catch radars because of low air flight."
On September 14, Saudi Alamco, the largest oil company in Saudi Arabia, was bombarded by 10 military drones.
Right after this, the anti-government organization of Yemen, "Fushi-ha," announced a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that it is Iran, led by President Rouhani, who is behind the Fusi faction.Iran is not allowed to make oil in hostile Saudi Arabia under circumstances where he cannot export crude oil, and if he continues to embargo the oil embargo against Iran, he will be informed by the international community that he suffers from a painful condition."
In response to the bombing, half of Saudi oil production stopped and crude oil prices hit a 15 percent surge.
There is also a voice that the oil shock will come again.
"I want to avoid military intervention at least until the next year's election is over, as Trump has pledged his commitment to withdrawing the US military from the Middle East, and Iran will continue to bomb the Fushi group in the future, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever.
The "voluntary war" of the United States and Iran is facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber, a super personality, became a regular employee.
Ask the adopted president (bizSPA!)
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 Delivery
YouTuber is now popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their own products, there are companies that have started a unique mechanism of using YouTuber as a regular employee in their company.
"DmMiX" is a direct marketing mix (hereafter referred to as "DmMiX") which is the main business of enterprise CRM.
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
As a DmMiX Representative Director, I talked to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is the first member of the subsidiary and staff of YouTuber.
I want to support young people who are good at using YouTuber.
What is the mechanism behind YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter, Kobayashi ) : The job of YouTuber is now a longing for many young people.
As elementary school students are in the top job rankings they want to get in the future, the number of young people who are aiming for will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are pursuing dreams such as Bandman and comedians.
In the same way, we adopted a young man who is pursuing his dream of becoming a YouTuber and decided to support it.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber? - There is an image that an individual is voluntarily posting videos.
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the job of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers don't have the money they thought.
There are a few creators who make and post videos while working as part-timers, and creators who don't allow their families to recognize YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide creators with an environment for pay and content creation.
At first, we would like to support our activities by supporting the demerits of the job of YouTuber, which becomes unstable.

"Korea wants to go back to GSOMIA" Deputy U.S. Secretary of State (Senkei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Napper, Deputy U.S. Secretary of State for Korea and Japan, said on November 27 that Korea would like to rethink the decision and come back to Japan's military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 in a single interview with the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to mention the reconquest of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is a base for sharing missile launch information and other information, which is signed by Japan, the United States and Korea.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it revokes, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
"Without GSOMIA, we can't respond effectively to the crisis."
"There is time to revocation," he urged Korea to return.
"It's the first time in the history of a joint flight training conducted in July over the Sea of Japan," he said, "It is imperative that the U.S.-Korea-Japan, which shares values such as democracy and human rights, collaborate in an alliance."
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "injury of U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill the gap."

【Bad Olympic Race in the first half of the race】The world champion, Kento Momota, and the strong Sutennari lead a step!
<Both Singles>(Bad x Spie!)
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Badminton's big event held in August, will participate in China's OP (Persian/Super 1000), which will open from September 17.
Here, we will look back on the first half of the Olympic race for the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo from May to August, and look forward to the men's singles for the mid-September to December.
The Badminton Olympic race started in May, and at the end of the World Championships, the top players competed in the four tournaments (super 500+).
In the first half of the game, he was the second winner of the 4th tournament, Mr. Kento Momota and Mr. Zhou Tian Cheng of Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championships, and Sutennari won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also has the JapanOP (S750).
From May, the competition will be held in four tournaments: the Sudilman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/The results will be 16 strong), JapanOP (July), and World Championships (August).
Although it is less expensive than other top players, it is a schedule that has reduced the burden on them.
August was only a World Championship tournament, so the fatigue would not be bigger than a series.
Good results will be required in the mid-season competition that will be held after September.
Taiwan's ace strong in the series.
The young Thai people also note!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already competed in seven competitions.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the prize.
Originally, the player who is strong and does not suffer the battle.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem with the performance of the game.
In fact, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming competition.
It was an impression that Zhou Tensei was not in explosive power until last year, but this year, the stableness of the playing field increased, allowing him to continue his good grades.
For Momota, the world's ranking 1st place, it seems to be an even harder opponent than ever before.
In addition to these two players, the results were only in the first half of the tournament.
And he is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is struggling as a European force.
Although Cantafone has not been able to enter the finals at the top of the competition, he has won the top of the competition, including entering the best 4 in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is now able to rally against the top players seems to have a huge potential for a leap in the Olympic race.
Sai Pranys B. also took a step out of India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is behind the scenes, are also pushing up, so we need to pay attention to the Indian forces after the midfield.
New Fees for Mobile: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company came out as a result of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it almost stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said that there was room to lower the price by about 40% last summer, and despite the growing expectations for lowering the price, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-blown entry into Rakuten is ahead and the oligibility of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have a price system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits a set discount on the terminals and telecommunications fees.
Because instead of selling the price of the terminal, the communication fee was set to be discounted.
SOFTBANK and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half.
However, for both companies, SIM locks, which cannot be used by other companies for 100 days, can be applied to devices.
NTT Docomo will make up to one-third of the cost of a terminal for only subscribers of their own lines.
It seems that the three companies continue to "enclose" to prevent transfers to other companies.
Regarding SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications indicated that it would require immediate termination.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten was not due to the development of a communication network such as the base station as planned.
It was expected to become a detonator of the lowering competition, so it was a slick look.
Is there a sweetness of outlook?
The start times and charges of full-scale services have not been revealed.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work in a responsible business.
The price revision was triggered by Mr. Kanbo's remarks.
Mr. Kan complained about three new prices: "I think the competition will begin in the future, and I don't think it would be good to do this."
"Changing government prices" does not seem to distort the market and encourage a healthy competition.
The corporate side should develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out of the government.
Each company's pricing system is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the device advertises "to be up to half" ads, the consumer's burden is more than half.
The company itself has to make a careful and easy-to-understand explanation to prevent the user's misinterpretation.

The Kuwana Mie Credit Safe and Kita-Ise Ueno Credit Safe will be held on October 1, and the Kihoku Credit Safe will be lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are a number of special cases in which cash cards and card numbers are spoofed, and special cases in which ATMs are issued are issued.

【 Rugby World Cup】Above and Fighting U.S. player's "Face Danger Tackle" overseas ripples "Abust and Obscene" ( THE ANSWER) - Yahoo!
U.S. FL Kyle is a raffle, former England representative "not called Tackle."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) tournament was held on 26th, and the United States was defeated in England in 7-45.
It was the beginning of the Black Star, but later, a rough play played by FL John Quill called the ripples.
Just like adding a shoulder tactile to the face of the opponent.
The real scene is also published with video in overseas media, and former England players have complained that they are "abusive and ruthless play" and "not called tactile."
【Video】 "Awesome and ruthless play" and overseas ripples!
The real moment of the "faced danger tactile" played by the U.S. representative Kyle is in a disturbance where both players are upset.
A hot fight broke the line.
The second half is 29 minutes.
Farel, the commander of England in deep enemies, broke a somewhat balance when he caught his path.
It was Kyle who went to Tackle.
However, he raised the upper body from the waist to the lower, and slammed his body into the upper body.
As a result, the opponent's head and head are in contact with the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
A fierce protest that English players would try to push the Kyle to play clearly lacking legitimacy.
The two military players gathered at once, and it became an air of immediate release.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle is left out with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the spectators asked for fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" featured the headlines "Running World Cup 2019: U.S. players are left behind in a gruesome play, England wins."
"Kil had a poor shoulder charge on the face of the face of the England Starr Farel, and it was an exit."
In the article, we introduced the comment of the former England player, Wogo Moña, a commentator.
"It's an insult, a desensical, not a tactile, a desensical play."
The U.S., who lacked one match, managed to lose in 81 minutes with an unbeatable strike.
However, the play of the Kyle left behind the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced for the first time the name of 424 hospitals in Japan in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reviewed the results of treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.The four facilities were targeted at the Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Oda Hospital in Watawara City Hospital.
⇒Reorganization of 4 Hospitals "Standard Funny"
In order to suppress the growing medical expenses due to aging, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we asked the relevant hospital for full-scale review of restructuring and integration, and we would like to conclude by September next year.
There is no force to force, but the resistance of local chiefs and residents is expected due to anxiety that a nearby hospital is gone.
The meeting was announced on the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29-1 percent, and there were relatively few hospitals.
According to prefectures, the percentage was high in Niigata (53, 7 %), Hokkaido (48, 6 %), Miyagi (47, 5 %), Yamaguchi (46, 7 %), and Okayama (43, 3 %).
The total number was 54 in Hokkaido and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on the data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare surveyed 1455 hospitals in response to "Advanced Acute Period" for serious patients and "Acute Phase" for general surgery.
We analysed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and the need to publicize the hospital's name by analyzing the location of a competing hospital within 20 minutes by car.
The target hospital is expected to consider the abolition and transfer of some departments to other hospitals.
Medical costs will surge in 25 years, when all the boomers are 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in 1246 thousand beds (18 years) across the country to 1191 thousand beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "Advanced Acute" and "Acute" where nurses are heavily placed and medical expenses are expensive.
In order to respond to aging, we need to not only reduce the number of beds, but also increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate the hospital, the "Regional Medical Initiative" was established to set the number of beds required by each prefecture for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 areas and consultations between local governments and medical professionals, but many of the local residents and chiefs maintain a cautious stance and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to activate the discussion by announcing the name of a poor hospital.
General training for disaster prevention, such as the eruption of Mt.Komaga: The first time in 18 years (Video) : Hokkaido Shimbun
On September 27, a comprehensive training was held in the forest, seven rice and Kabe town in the Watashima pipe.
Around 400 people attended the event, including the road and 3 towns.
It was the first time that the Hokkaido Komagake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council established an evacuation plan that included evacuation routes for residents in August.
It was the first time in 18 years for residents to participate.
It is assumed that at 8:45 a.m. Mt. Komagake erupted and mud flow reached the mountain base town.
When the eruption alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), a shelter was established in both the forest and Shichii town, and the residents moved by buses and police vehicles prepared by each town.
100,000 students complain about school-off Global Warming (Everyone's Economic Newspaper Network) - Yahoo! News
Around 100,000 citizens, including students who empathized with the 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched to Vancouver on September 27 in response to climate change.
Climate Demo in Vancouver
The march took place from the Vancouver City Hall to the Canby Bridge and to the downtown library.
In front of the city hall of the meeting place, people with plastic cards began to gather a few hours before the start, and at 13 o'clock at the start time to fill the city hall a few blocks road.
The number of participants continued to increase and eventually more than 100,000 people participated.
On the road on the way, the police also cooperated with the road regulations and watched them for a few hours until all people were walking.
In line with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York, the city has held a number of events to think about global warming from the last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, the school strike was "Friday for the future".
The students who took part in the school day complained to the adults that they would like to protect the earth until they rested on the important things of the school, and many adults who took off their jobs responded, "We will do our best for the future of children thinking seriously."
Pork Corella Vaccine Recommended Region 9 Prefecture, Ministry of Agriculture and Water (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries published a draft amendment to the quarantine guidelines for preventing the spread of "pork" cholera, an animal-infected disease, in order to prevent the spread of the disease.
The target region will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have confirmed the infection with pigs and wild boars.
The movement of living pigs and fertilized eggs, which are vaccinated, is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is recognized.
After receiving public comments to the general public (student call), we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the launch of September last year, Japan has been holding a position in the clean country.
In the revised draft, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water established a "Vaccine Proposed Area" based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures that are recommended for vaccination are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
The region will review the situation when the guidelines are revised.
In principle, the movement of injected pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and vultures is restricted to the region.
In regard to meat and processed products, it is not intended to be subject to the cost and impact of distribution restrictions on farmers, and it virtually accepts distribution outside the region.
To prevent the virus from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also appeals to the safety of the inoculated pigs and works to prevent the damage.
The amendments to the Guidelines were summarized at the meeting of the Experts' Meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Edemiological Headquarters.
In the future, consultations and public comments to the prefectural government will be held until October 7, and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
A free-standing approach to Keisuke Honda and Man U!
"Please offer, don't need money" ( Football Channel ) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 Delivery
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and Keisuke Honda, a former member of Japan, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually playing the game?
The truth of the sky is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on July 27, made a public approach to one of the clubs, saying, "You don't need money, but you need to play with a great team or a great teammate."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world's best name.
Why did Honda make a huge request for one of the premier league clubs?
The reason was in the Australian edition of FOX Sports, which was released on 24th.
In an article titled "5 FWs that could grab Manchester United in the face of an injury-related crisis," five players who are now eligible to win were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
There are currently many injuries in United, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marchal and FW Marcus Rushford.
"Red Devil" led by Ole Gunner Suurshal has been forced to slide in 2 wins and 22 defeats in the league, and is challenging in the quality of the front line.
In this way, Honda was named as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, it was analyzed that "the contract of Honda as a creative side player, rather than a striker, can be filled with holes in which Andreas Pereira is buried."
"The 33-year-old Honda needs to move away from his entertainment that manages the Cambodian national team and get full attention," he said.
Is there a Honda approach?
It is also notable that United will move forward for the next year's Tokyo Olympics season with the goal and commitment.

Ikemura Kansei Ikemura No need to beat the first time?
Today's best shot
The 1W shot is not necessarily a slap.
There is also the so-called "director" technique, which is to pick up the ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance with the second shot of par 5.
The recent 1W has a large head volume, which is associated with the risk of spreading the ball.
Ikemura Kansei is waiting for his first victory.
The 24th-year-old is 166 cm tall and is now 7th in the driving resistance division (average 304.02yd).
While he was good at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairway Wood.
"I don't have a shot of a spoon (3W) at the beginning of spring, so I'd like to try a diaper."
From the practice round, you can put the ball on top of the grass in the area and sprinkle 1W.
In the case of the need for Big Care, we are using a lot of tips, but we are making effective use of dora in a narrow hall.
"It can be used in the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
The ballistic instruments recorded 270yd-280yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W, so I can say that I can feel more relieved than 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cady bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
We are also pleased to hear from our tour buddies that we can see from the gallery.
The trick is to "make the club level (horizontal)".
"Even if I hit the lower blow or upper, I don't fly straight.I go right in the cut orbit.I was originally doing a direct dora to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tiup) and the attack angle (at the club's angle) is also moderate.
"So the left side is turned off (not to the left).
It's a professional technique that makes you feel uninhabitable.

The first publication of a self-written manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa | Shizuoka Shimbun at ES
A self-written manuscript by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, first published at the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall
The author Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) published a self-written manuscript of his essay, "Stutorial, Too Literary," which was published in his last years in which he fought literary theory with Junichiro Tanizaki.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.
It was known that there was an excellent handwriting, such as being recorded in all collections, but it was the first time that the manuscript was published to the public.
It seems that he wrote a few months before Akutagawa's suicide, and a researcher at the Memorial Hall said, "Akutagawa, who was both mentally and physically debilitated, has a gruesome mind and face serious literary challenges."
The 12 essays, consisting of a 200-character paper, were published in the April 27 issue of "Literary Spring Autumn".
Greta Tombelli: "Why do the adults laugh and threaten their children?"
Swedish environmental activist Greta Tounbergi gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech has been noted, there has been a call to insult Greta.
[Tweet] Greta Toun Berry: "Why do the adults laugh and threaten their children?"
Political critics said that Greta was "spiritually sick, used for parents and international left wing," and the TV station in charge apologized.
In Japan, on the Internet, there are a lot of reports saying that Mr. Greta is not the content of Mr. Greta, saying, "It's good to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do the adults use time to laugh and threaten teens and children?"
"I think of as much lies and conspiracy theory as I think."
Greta said, "You've also started, and as you've noticed, the people who hate me are still active, my clothes, my attitudes, and I'm going to follow people differently, and they'll come up with an unthinkable lie and conspiracy theory."
And they pointed out that they seem to have a problem with the story because they do not want to face climate and environmental crises.
I don't understand why the adults use time to laugh and threaten teens and children.
That time would be another good thing.
I think they will feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world has begun to wake up.
Changes are coming.
Even if they like the change, they don't like it.
Meet on the streets on Friday!
On Friday 20th of the previous week, a global climate change strike was held in New York and elsewhere.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach a certain degree in the first half, so I thought I could go to that momentum in the second half, but I was sorry because I couldn't help but grow.
Is the 6th Eagle, the 7th Bardi win?
Even after I hit Boggy at No. 4, the par 5 was still there, so I had to take it back and I had a chip-in-eagle on No. 6.
Even at No. 7 he was able to get a chance, but I was sorry that I couldn't reach out later.
What did you get in the tournament?
I was glad that I was able to keep the fairway on a narrow course because I didn't feel good lately (shot).
The rough and opposite sides of the course were different, and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between the usual competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I did take videos and so on.
I didn't have much changed in other places, but it was just a competition in which there were few Japanese players in the co-organization.
The second half will continue, but if you don't win more than one win, you will not be able to win one more win, so you will also have the ZOZO championship in the near future.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it "forgot"?
Interview/Watanabe / Yo Watanabe
A drug with dementia that has been frustrated by research and development by major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals.
However, it has been revealed that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is becoming clear, and it may be possible to keep things from forgetting.
Kinki University Hospital Dr. Shunsuke Otsuki told me about his research.
No dementia.
What is the current status of dementia prevention or treatment?
Otsuki From mild to severe, the degree of difference may be different, but if everyone ages, they may become dementia.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The commonly used drug called Donepezil in Japan is already out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and it is not expected to have a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, cancer deaths have decreased due to infectious diseases and accidents, and cancer deaths have been reduced due to significant progress in treatment of anti-cancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
It is not possible to solve the problem only by the person or family, but it is necessary to create an environment where people can live in the community as a whole.
How to keep things "forgot"
Are there people who are prone to dementia and are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, it is possible to keep the symptoms as low as possible and keep them "forgot things".
Dementia is considered as one of the living habits, and tends to be prone to people.
First, metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets can be stored in frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
People who live in an environment where gas and electricity cannot be used and cannot be used in the first place.
When it comes to diets with fewer vegetables and proteins, it becomes a life that is biased by lipids and sugars.
In the end, it becomes poor, but obese, and when it comes to doing it, the TV is only blurred and the body is free.
Similar situations can also be in Japan.
In addition, people who don't think about things and don't work tend to get dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, we need to read books and think about things from day to day.
