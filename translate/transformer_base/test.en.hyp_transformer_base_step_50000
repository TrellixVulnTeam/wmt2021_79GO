Driving with high heel is dangerous!
Auto Messe Web - Yahoo!News
Violence against Road Traffic Law
It has been noted that there has been an increase in reports of accidents caused by false operation such as pedal mistakes, but it is a big mistake to think that this is only an elderly driver.
In the number of occurrences of pedal mistakes by age (Source: The National Police Agency, 2015), the number of incidents has increased from 1080 cases under 24 years old to 1032 cases over 75 years old.
There are not many mistakes in the elderly, and it is important to call attention to young people as well.
Do you take a shale at your feet?
Take safety?
This data does not describe gender-to-female ratios and causes, but it is different from those of the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves.
In particular, there are some women who choose various shoes depending on their clothes, such as high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules, and drive as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but it is troublesome to wear it, but some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and there are many people driving without hesitation.
However, driving with high heels and sandals violates the road traffic laws.
One is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations are operated, and Article 70 "Safety Driving Obligations violations" which stipulates that "the operation shall not cause accidents and harm the person".
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters set forth by the Prefectural Public Safety Commission.For example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Rules of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, "Do not drive a vehicle (excluding a light vehicle) by wearing a footwear that interferes with the operation of the vehicle, slippers, hanging, high heel, or other driving operation, or by means that it prevents the operation."
In each prefecture, it is the same as the intent of "a footwear that can prevent driving operation" until it is not specified as high heels.
So why is driving with high heel dangerous?
It's clear if you think about the basics of pedal operation safely.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, first fix the foot to the floor, place the foot vertically against the brake pedal, then tilt the foot to the right as a starting point when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not shake regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, with high heel, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel is always brushed with gravure, and because the heel is high, the area of the foot to which the pedal is ground is small, it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This could lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get the heel's heel's heel's heel when it comes to brakes and the pedal cannot be trampled or the heel's heel's heel's heel's stuck in the heel's heel's stuck in the heel's heel's stuck in the heel's hand, and sometimes it's
In addition, there are cases where the heel is stuck on the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer able to return when stepping on the pedal.

The local industry in Awaji Island, Hyogo Prefecture, the Kinki Ceramics manufactured by "Aji tile" filed for quasi-self bankruptcy debt of about 2 billion yen (Eikoku Data Bank) - Yahoo!News
The decline in the housing market and the subsequent damage caused by the disaster caused the deterioration in the tile roof of consumers.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporate Code: 530173983, capital: 99.2 million yen, Otani 881-8, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative Kozo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self bankruptcy on August 30.
The application agent is Daiji Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishi-Tenman, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka-shi, and Daichi Yoshida Law Office.
Established in June 1895 (Meiji 28) and reorganized in April 1961 (Showa 36).
At the beginning, he started his business as a manufacturer of Ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishiwaji-cho, Mihara-gun (present-day Minamiawaji-shi).
In October 1986, the company merged with Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and inherited the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd.
After that, sales offices in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, and Miyazaki City were established and the current system was established.As a result of the changes in consumer demand, Western-style tiles such as flat-screen tiles were produced at 70% and Japanese-style tiles were produced at 30%.
The company has built a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction contractors.
As a manufacturer of the top tiles in Awaji Island, it is well known.
However, due to the sluggish housing market since the Lehman shock, the damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, consumer demand has been growing rapidly, and the annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 decreased to approximately 1345 million yen.
In terms of profits, the decline in the profit margin caused by the rise in fuel prices resulted in a continuous deficit with excess interest-bearing debt associated with inventory and business fixed investment.
For this reason, financial institutions have been trying to rebuild their business by requesting financial institutions to alleviate the conditions for repayment of loans, but there are no signs of a recovery in business conditions.
I was unable to come here and give up my business continuity, and this was the measure.
Although debt is currently under investigation, it is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

"Now I'm sure it's a bit different in my life, I'm 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be that kind of feeling.In spring, I thought, "I'm going to finish doing this, but I'm going to go back and feel like I can't believe that I can go to a better place."
From the beginning of June, we were able to respond gradually.
"Every day we can do more, and we can do more every day."
There was a trial and error, but by taking on the hypotheses that I set myself up one after another, the condition got better and the results got better.

Darvish, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it now, I'm going to talk with the agents and my family."
The final conclusion is not clear, but the feeling seems to be solid.

The training was based on the assumption that a man who went out to see the mushroom picking would not return home at night.
The participants are divided into three groups to search through the mountains with the names of the missing men.
In Shingo Village, a 70-year-old man, who entered the mountain in June, is missing and the next day is injured and is rescued.

On the first day of "Senkyo Gakuen" performance greetings
This film is a painful story in which Yakuza and the team leader of the Okimoto group, who are not interested in social contribution, take on the reconstruction of the high school just before bankruptcy, and resolve numerous difficult issues with morals.
Nishijima plays Nismura, who has always been choreographed to his parents, as a strong but somehow unhateable leader.
Nishijima said, "I've been nervous all the time to this day."
"Not only during the filming period, but even after the filming was over, the members gathered together all the time and talked about a lot of things, and they were a very united team."
ITO also said, "There was just a drinking party that didn't reflect on me at all," and laughed, "It was a plus for the scene that I was able to create that kind of time.It was a good teamwork, and I got motivated, and since the end of the meeting, I had a lot of good memories.
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Nishijima confesses, "If I had a meeting with this member, I would drink too much, and I often don't remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know what the other person is doing, I don't know what it is," and he said, "It looks like a siraf, but I was drunk?It's really a good drunk person."
It was a work that nurtured a good teamwork, and Nishida said, "If you have a good reputation, it might be a series.I would like to do my best to make a series with all of you," and Ito said, "We are also in a series."

In response to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima Prefecture, discussions on full-scale operations in each area and other areas were put into effect on the fishery's ongoing test operation.
On the 27th, the union leader of the Prefectural Fishery Federation (F fishing cooperative association) held a meeting at the Prefectural Fisheries Hall in Chuodai-Iino, where the union leader and others from the prefecture attended.
At the union leader's meeting, it was also approved to formally add to the target fish species for the test operation, with regard to the catago, cherry trout, and Murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, when the restrictions on shipment were lifted.
The remaining unspecified marine products were two fish species: a binos Guy and a Common Casbe.
At the end of the meeting, President Nozaki stated that the timing of the full-scale operation was undecided.
In response to the water treatment after purifying the contaminated water of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, he said, "There is a problem with Keren flavored discussions, and there is no change in the position of opposition to the release of the ocean."
In discussing the full-scale operation, Mr. Akira Egawa, the head of the association of the Iwaki City Fishermen's Association, pointed out that "it is necessary to raise the opinion from the bottom," and said that he respected the opinions of the members.
The council will hold a meeting of the subsidy offices, resolve the problems one by one, and make a conclusion as a municipal cooperative.
The union leader of the Soma Futaba fishing cooperative, Mr. Hiroji Tachiya, said, "It is necessary to discuss not only the fishermen but also the matchmaker."
Soma Futaba Fishing Co., Ltd. has received the support of the country, and seven new ships will enter next year. "First of all, it is important to return the catch," he said, and expressed his intention to promote environmental improvement in parallel with the full-scale operation talks.

"Beauty and Evil" is a piece of paper?
What is the image of a "snake" that overlaps with the beautiful girls in their works? - Yahoo!News
Is the beauty of mystical beauty and the expression of the shadow in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent out to the world, and "A Collection of Beautiful Girls" (Genkosha) has been released in August 2019 with a focus on the beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Umezu, who is known as the first person in "Fear Manga".
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of your work that is not seen again in the picture.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Beautiful girls (5 pieces) of the works that do not appear in plum blossoms
In the preface of the "Beautiful Collection", there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of the women who have opposite poles," but because there is a contrast between the beautiful face and the expression of the grudge that distorted and resented ..., "fear" may be more prominent.
There is a keyword "snake" in many of the works that are not seen in the picture, but snakes are perceived by the viewer as "sweeping creatures", people who feel "beautiful" and receive various kinds of things.
There are people who love reptiles in the world, and some people don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensibilities of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugliness" may be the "snake" of the living beings in the back.
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" resides is good luck.
There are also works in the series "Mama Kowai!" in 1965, "Abbit Girl" and "Aboriginal Girl".
In the market, it is said that a beautiful woman with a shadow is the one who becomes a "a woman."
Is it a good idea to say that it is a "cool beauty" type if you put it in an immature way ... ... I feel that it is the common point of the beautiful girls appearing in the picture.
In particular, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Boys Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative figure of the plum tree work, but it is reminiscent of a "snake" somewhere, such as a deep sleep every 100 years to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, and a mysterious power.

Mr. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister for Defense of Japan, deleted a Twitter comment written by 27 days ago when he had a meal at a yakitori shop in Saga prefecture.
Mr. Yamamoto entered the prefecture on February 26 to explain the results of the crash of the AH64D combat helicopter from the Ground Self-Defense Force in Kamisaki City in the prefecture.
On the evening of the same day, "I visited Saga Prefecture on a business trip!" tweeted.

[Etsuyama Wakamizu] The circle of "Children's Cafeteria" that provides free or cheap meals for children is spreading throughout Japan.
According to a survey by NPOs, approximately 3700 NPOs are active this year.
There are 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture with an increase of 9 locations compared to last year, increasing by 1-6 times compared to 2018.
Why is it a children's restaurant now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, chairman of the NPO and social activist, talked about the background and significance of the lecture at a lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging population, the region becomes lonely and the shopping district is also declining.
There was no place for people to meet.
Therefore, there was a need for an exchange base in the area where people and people interacted with each other.
Even if it is a children's restaurant, it is a "multi-generation exchange place" where the elderly also participate.
In addition to eliminating the need to eat alone, it will also lead to child-rearing support and health promotion for the elderly.
Cut off the chains of poverty and revitalize the region.
What is important is "Don't create children who will be left behind."
There are a variety of places to eat every day, from one month to the other.
There are a variety of venues, from several to several hundred people, and from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere is getting more and more people who want to do it.
Such a low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
We may also hear about issues such as safety management systems.
Although it is ◾, "By engaging with many people, our values change." "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of a disaster," Yuasa says.
It is like the light of hope with closed society.

"Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has improved dramatically by analyzing crashed US drones in recent years.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, and the range of operation is about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that it's hard to catch the radar because it's flying low in the sky."
On September 14, Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" announced a statement of crime.
"It is no doubt that the people behind the Fusi are Iran, led by President Rouhani, and Iran is not allowed to make a profit with oil in a hostile Saudi country in a situation where its oil cannot be exported.If Iran continues to embargo crude oil, it is hoped that the international community will be informed that there will be a corresponding pain."
In response to the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and crude oil prices rose by 15 percent.
There is also a voice that the oil shock will come again as it is.
"I'd like to avoid military interventions, at least until the end of the next year's elections, as Trump has set a pledge to withdraw from the Middle East, and Iran will continue to bomb a drone in the context of the Fusi, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever, and there is plenty of possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The surrogate war between the United States and Iran is now in a crisis of immediate consequences.
The reason why YouTuber, a very individualist, has become a regular employee.
Listen to the president who hired you (bizSPA!)
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 Delivery
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use them for advertising of their own products, there are companies that have started a rare system called "youtuber adoption" that they use as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "DmMiX") is the main business of enterprise CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I talked to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is the representative director of DmMiX and also a representative of YouTuber's subsidiary, Staff First.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is the mechanism of YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter, "Kobayashi") : Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people have longed for.
Elementary school students are on the top of the list of careers they want to get in the future, and the number of young people they are aiming for will increase.
In the past, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing their dreams, such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "youtuber adoption" to adopt the young people who are chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber and to support them.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: There is a reality that many young people are interested in the profession of YouTuber, but most YouTubers are not able to earn as much as they expected.
There are not many creators who are making videos and posting while working part-time jobs, and some creators who are not allowed to recognize the existence of YouTuber by their families.
In this effort, we will provide our creators with an environment to create their own pay and content.
At first, we would like to support our activities by supporting the demerits of the profession of YouTuber, which is in an unstable position.

"I hope that Korea will return to GSOMIA" Deputy U.S. Secretary of State (OIST) - Yahoo!News
Napper, U.S. Deputy Secretary-General of the United States, said on November 27 that he would like to re-think the decision and come back to the US Ambassador's office in Tokyo.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the rethinking of GSMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is the basis for sharing information on missile launches, etc., with the signing of the agreement between Japan and Korea, the United States, and the United States.
In August, South Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper said, "Without GSOMIA, we cannot respond effectively to the crisis."
He strongly encouraged the return of Korea, saying, "There is time to expire."
He also pointed out the threat recognition that China-Russia's joint flight training in July over the Sea of Japan was "the first time ever in history."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in the relationship between Japan and the Republic of Korea "will hurt the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role in filling the gap."

Tokaimura Critical Accident, 20 years in 30 days Nuclear Facilities Trouble 3100: Hokkaido Shimbun
According to a report by the Japan Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) on March 28th, 336 incidents of accidents and failures occurred at nuclear-related facilities in Japan from 2000 to 2006, following a critical accident in Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture, which was the first in history of nuclear power in Japan.
Thirty days and twenty years have passed since the critical accident, which alarmed the safety myths of the nuclear industry.
According to the report, although the International Assessment Scale (INES) that shows seriousness accounted for about 90% of the level 0 (not critical for safety) and unsatisfied cases, it is necessary to raise awareness of unsatisfactory safety in light of the accident and the lessons learned from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in 2011.
Mr. Koichi Soda, who has completed the story and original drawings of his creative picture book, has been collecting donations for publication.
Koichi Soda (64), an artist in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, started a crowdfunding campaign with the aim of publishing a creative picture book inspired by the legends of the prefecture.
Mr. Soda, who was originally from Hokkaido and started his activities as a cooperative team from April this year, says, "I would like to convey the kindness of the people of Fukui through picture books based on deep faith."
[To donate here] To convey the spirit of Fukui.
While Muneda is active as an artist working on contemporary art with mathematical motifs, he has also been working as a co-op since he passed the calendar.
After working in Nagano, Kumamoto, and Tochigi, he joined Echizen City in April this year.
The aim is to create a town based on the use of picture books in the city, which was produced by Satoko Kako and Chihiro Iwaki.
He lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion around him for the first time."
What attracted attention was the legend of the city of Awara, "The face of the devil of the bridegroom."
In response to the mother and daughter who is unable to grasp the face of the demon, the gentle wife continues to chant the Nenbutsu in order to help her mother and daughter without worrying about being surprised.
"I forgot my hatred and returned with compassion and kindness, and felt the origin of the piety and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Soda-san, who got a hint, went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Asawara City as soon as he arrived at his original picture book, and completed the story "Meoto Oni" where a couple of gentle oni and a boy appeared.
In June, he took advantage of his master's work and drew 10 scenes with warm watercolor paintings, and the materials of the picture book were aligned.
In addition, the cover of the picture book will be made with Japanese paper, making use of Echizen Washi, a traditional craft in Echizen City.
Through reading and writing, parents and children will be able to enjoy the touch of washi.
To publish 600 copies, the goal of the donation is 850,000 yen.
The deadline is until October 25.
Mr. Soda said, "The heart of Fukui, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud of all over the country.
I would like to convey the true kindness and compassion that have been handed down to children through picture books."
It is one of the projects in which Fukui Prefecture is certified as one of the 11 projects of regional revitalization that Fukui Prefecture is challenged by as a cooperative organization and business operator.
The Fukui Shimbun communicates information and the Fukui Bank cooperates with management support.

If you want to use Sidecar -
According to Apple, macOS Catalina of the new OS will be launched in October.
The specific date is not clear, but it may be delivered on October 4.
[See all images] macOS Catalina release date may be October 4.
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple website.
There is certainly a character in the image "From October 4 (fra den 4. oktober)".
On the official website, the accuracy of the information seems to be high.
By the way, "Sidecar (side car)" is the most popular feature on macOS Catalina.
This is a feature that deals with iPad as a sub-display on your Mac, and it is a function that has been implemented with the third application.
And since Sidecar is a genuine Apple function, it is expected that it is better with a more completeness (and response).
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all I would like to experience this next-generation macOS.
Strengthening process cherry shrimp PT, water depth of 290 meters in Shizuoka City | Shizuoka Shimbun
Born this year in Suruga Bay, Susumu Kabahara, Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka, Japan, on September 11th (provided by the Yui Sakura Ebi Project).
The Yubi Sakura Ebi Project, an industry-academia-government-academia-government-academia-government marine industrial cluster council, has succeeded in shooting cherry shrimp, which is believed to have been born during the spring-summer spawning season, at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.
The image of the growth process is valuable, and the people involved want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of cherry shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photograph was taken near the seabed of about 1 or 5 km off the coast of Kabaru District, Shimizu-ku.
About 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.
During the day, Sakura shrimp in the depths of the sea were recognised by the traditional knowledge that they form a certain number of groups on the seabed.
The adult body is about 40 mm long, and the individual shown is about 23 mm long.
The spawning period was identified by matching the seasonal data of the fried shrimp.
Detailed analysis is requested by Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Technical College, which constitutes a team.
Yusuke Mizuno, project leader, says, "I want to capture the lives of the individual in the growth process, including young shrimp."
Resumption of the mother ranch, Chiba residents are free of charge By the end of October, damage by typhoon|Shizuoka Shimbun
Chiba's mascot character "Chiba-kun" (Chiba's mascot character "Chiba-kun") greets visitors at the mother ranch where they resumed their business.
Mother ranch in Tomizu City, Chiba Prefecture, which had been closed since 9 days due to power outages and damage caused by Typhoon No.15, resumed operations on 28th.
Chiba residents are free to enter the affected areas by the end of October.
A lot of people came to the park at the same time as the opening, and at the entrance gate, the mascot character "Chiba-kun" of the prefecture who ran to cheering was welcomed.
The roof was covered with blue sheets, and there are facilities that have been repaired, but half of the restaurants were ready to reopen.
Mr. Kenji Mitani (34), a member of Sagamihara's family, said with a smile, "I was worried about when to resume, and I was looking forward to seeing an event of potato digging because I thought it would lead to reconstruction."

[The first half of the Badmin Olympic race] The world's champion, Kento Momota, and the strong Shutensei lead one step!
<Men's singles<(Bad x Spi!)
The Japanese national team, who won six medals at the Badminton Big Event in August and the 25th World Championship in Basel, Switzerland, will take part in the China OP (Jianzhou Super1000) which will open on September 17 after finishing the training camp in early September.
Here, we will look back on the first half of the Olympic race from May to August, when the Olympics race started to take place in Tokyo next year, and look forward to the men's singles from September to December.
The Badminton Olympics race, which began in May, digested four top-ranked tournaments (Super 500 or more) at the end of the World Championship.
In the first half of the tournament, Kento Momota, who won the second place in the four tournaments, and Zhou Tian Cheng, who won the second place in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship, while Zhou Tensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Points, which are directly linked to the Olympics.
Momota is also in charge of the Japan Op (S750).
The four tournaments that have been participating since May are the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesian OP (July/finals of 16+), Japan OP (July), and the World Championship (August).
Although the number is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the time of the series.
A good result is required in the mid-game competition, where the top tournaments from September will continue.
Taiwan's ace is strong against the battle.
It is also attracting attention to young Thai people!
He also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500) tournaments, and has already participated in seven tournaments.
He also participated in the Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the grand prize.
He was originally a player who had a strong physical and did not suffer a series of battles.
There is no major problem in the performance of the game, even if the competition continues.
In the first half of the year, we were able to win high points, making it easier for us to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Although Zhou Tensei had an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, this year's play-related stability increased, making it possible to maintain good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking player, it seems that he will be an awkward partner than ever before.
In addition to these two players, the results were left in the first half of the game: Thai young Ace Cantafone and Indian Cy Pranys B. .
And there are three European players, Anders Antonsen, who are struggling alone.
Although Cantafone has no choice but to enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he is now in the top four in the second tournament this season.
Although there is still a rough side, it seems that the 20-year-old, 21-year-old, who has been able to rally against the top players, has a great potential to jump in the Olympic race.
Sai Pranys B. also took a step out of India, where he had a good match with singles.
Samir Balama, Phranoy H.S., and Sliccanth Kidambi, who is behind Kega, will also be catching up in the coming years, so attention should be paid to India after the mid-war.
New price for mobile phone: Decrease in price with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was announced as a result of the revision of the Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it almost stopped high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that there was room for a 40% reduction in prices last summer, and despite the growing expectations for a price reduction, there was no price competition.
A major factor is the fact that Rakuten's full-scale entry is postponed, and the oligopolitic status of the three major companies continues.
For consumers, it is desirable to be a price system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I would like to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee cheaply, the communication fee was set to be expensive.
SOFTBANK and KDDI (au) have announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half.
However, in the 100 days between the two companies, SIM locks, which can not be used by other companies, are a system that takes on the terminal.
NTT DOCOMO will make up to one-third of the terminal fee for only subscribers on their own lines.
The three companies seem to continue to "enclose" to prevent transfers to other companies.
With regard to SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications indicated its policy of obligating the immediate termination.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten was due to the development of the base stations and other communication networks as planned.
As it was expected to be a detonator of lowering competition, it was so cool that it looked like it was.
There was a sweetness of the outlook.
There is no clear indication of the start date or rate of full service.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for our business.
The change in the price was triggered by the remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new price of the three companies, saying, "I think competition is going to begin in the future, I don't think it's going to be as good as this."
However, I don't think that the "decrease in government prices" will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
The corporate side should develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out of the government.
Each company's fee system is very complicated and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that although the device has advertised "maximum half of the price", there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the price.
We must be careful and easy-to-understand explanations so that the company does not mislead the user.
Lowering the withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen Cash Card for Three Credits in Mie - Ise Shimbun
In order to prevent the damage of special scams, the three shinkin banks in Mie Prefecture (Kiso Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Iseue Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced that they have decided to reduce the withdrawal limit by cash card.
In the past three years, the bank has held a cash card for each credit bank of Kuwana Mie, Kita-Iseue Ueno, and Kihoku. For depositors over 70 years old who have never made a fixed deposit at ATMs, the maximum amount of 500,000 yen can be issued per day by cash card.
Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita-Iseue Ueno Shinkin Bank will be lowered on October 1, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank will start on November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many cases of special scams that are issued at ATMs after spoofing cash cards and gloomy numbers from financial institutions and police officials.
In the sudden passing of Tomokata Itsu | Shizuoka Shimbun
The Japan Sumo Association announced on May 27 that it has approved the transfer of three rikishi and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Tomokata Itsu (former Sekiwaki Fudoko).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Itsutsu room.
His master Mutsu no Chikakata (former Oseki Kirishima) is a brother and son of the late Itsu no Chikakata from Itsutsu Room.
The parents of Itsutsu passed away suddenly on 16th, and Tsururyu and others stayed in the same room for a while, and future treatment was being discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 rikishi students from Mongolia, including Mt.Ten Ryoma, who is from Mongolia, and as of autumn.
[Rugby World Cup] One Outing & Offensive Fighting Overseas ripples "An insult and poor play" ( THE ANSWER ) - Yahoo!News
The FL Quill of the U.S. is playing rough and the former British representative, "It's not something that can be called Tackle."
Japan's Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was held on 26th, and the United States, which was the last to appear in 20 countries, was defeated in England in 7-45.
In the second half, a rough play played by FLJohn Quill called the ripples.
It is like adding a shoulder tactile to the face of the other person.
The Japanese media also released the actual scene with a video, and the former English national team also complained, "It's an insult and a poor play."
[Videos] "An insulting and subdued play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of the "faced danger tackle" played by the U.S. representative Kyle, the "faced danger tackle" played by the U.S. representative Kyle.
A passionate struggle has crossed the line.
It was 29 minutes in the second half that I received at 0-38.
Farel, the captain of England, was deeply in the enemy's position, and he had a little bit of a balance when he caught his path.
I went to Takkul.
However, the upper body was not raised from the waist to the lower, and the upper body was violently attached to the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the other person come into contact with the shape of the head.
Farel flew violently and fell down.
The English player tries to push the Kyle out of the play, which clearly lacks legitimacy.
The two players gathered together at once, and it became the air of a sense of urgency.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves the scene with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the spectators asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" of New Zealand's strong rugby team is featured in the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out with poor play and England wins".
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of Farel, an English star, and it became a retreat."
In the article, we will introduce the comments of former England players and commentator Wugo Mogna.
He said, "It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The U.S. lacked a single match, but the U.S. managed to escape the defeat by taking a try at the 81st minute.
However, Kyle's play has left behind the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced the names of 424 public hospitals in Japan, including 1455 public hospitals and Japanese Red Cross hospitals, for the first time.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the results of treatment of 14 public and public hospitals. The four facilities of the National Hospital of Awara Hospital in Awa City were targeted: Oda Hospital in Echizen-cho, Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama-cho.
⇒Reorganization target four hospitals "standard funny"
In order to suppress medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging of the population, it is necessary to reorganize and integrate with hospitals in competitive regions.
In October, we requested full-scale review of the reorganization and integration of the hospital, and we would like to make a conclusion by September next year.
Although there is no force, the local chiefs and residents are expected to be repulsed because of the fear that a nearby hospital will be gone.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%, and there were relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the proportions were high in Niigata (53, 7 %), Hokkaido (48, 6 %), Miyagi (47, 5 %), Yamaguchi (46, 7 %), and Okayama (43, 3 %).
The target number was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare surveyed 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "high acute phase" and "acute phase" for severe patients.
He analyzed the clinical results of nine items such as cancer and emergency medicine, and the location of competing hospitals within 20 minutes by car, and judged the necessity of publishing the hospital name.
The hospital will be subject to consideration for the abolition and the transfer of some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses surged in 25 years, when all of the baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in 1246 thousand hospitals across Japan to 11.91 thousand beds.
Currently, the number of beds in the "high-altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" is high, but there is a lack of rehabilitation for the elderly.
In order to respond to the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate the hospital, we have formulated a "regional medical plan" that sets the number of beds required for 25 years by each prefecture.
The country is divided into 339 areas, and local governments and medical officials have been discussing, but many of the local residents and chiefs have maintained their cautious attitudes, and discussions have been difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare aims to revitalize the debate by publishing the name of a hospital with few achievements.
Estimating the Eruption of Mt.Komagatake, Disaster Prevention Comprehensive Training on the Road, etc.
On September 27th, a comprehensive disaster drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe Town in the Toshima Canal.
Approximately 400 people from 20 organizations, including Hokkaido and 3 towns, and residents participated.
It was the first time that the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan that included evacuation routes for residents in August.
It was the first time for the residents to participate in a wide-area training in 18 years.
It is assumed that Mt.Komaga erupted at 8:45 a.m. and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the level of eruption alert was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in the forest and Nanae, and the residents moved by bus and police vehicles prepared by each town.

On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school on the day said, "I want to protect the planet until they leave school."Many of the adults who took part in the school day said, "We will do our best for the future of children who are thinking seriously."
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on May 27 that it has revised the Anti-Secretary Guidelines to prevent the spread of Ton cholera, an infectious disease of livestock.
The target region is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boar.
The movement of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is permitted outside the region.
As soon as possible, the process will be completed in October, following public comments to the general public.
By using vaccines and permitting the distribution of meat and other meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations, and it is likely to affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan's status as a clean country has been on hold.
Based on the opinions of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set up a "region recommended for vaccination" for areas with a high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope and time of vaccination, the number of heads, and how to proceed. The prefecture will be approved by the governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures that have been recommended for vaccination include Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
The region will review the situation once the guidelines have been revised.
In principle, the movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, and feces is limited to the region.
In the case of meat and processed products, they are not subject to the costs associated with restrictions on distribution and the impact on farmers, and they are allowed to circulate outside the region.
In order not to spread the virus, we will thoroughly process food waste.
We will also work to prevent harmful rumors by complaining about the safety of the inoculated pigs.
The amendments to the Guidelines were reviewed at the meeting of the Anti-Proliferation and Prevention Headquarters, which was held on the same day.
In the future, we will carry out consultations and public comments on prefectures until October 7, and implement new anti-disease measures.
An open approach to Kensuke Honda and Man U!
"Don't have money" ( Football Channel ) - Yahoo!News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 Distribution
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and his former member, Mr. Keisuke Honda, took an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, was actually in a game?
The truth of God is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on the 27th of Japan time, has made a public approach to a club, saying, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world's leading figure.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
The inspiration was found in the Australian version of FOX Sports, which was released on 24th.
In an article titled "Fifteen FWs that Manchester United could catch in the face of a subsequent injury crisis," five non-members who are currently eligible to win were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda's name was also included.
Currently, United has suffered many injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marsal, FW Marcus Rushford, etc.
The "Red Devil" led by director Orlé Gunner Surshar is forced to slip in two wins and 22 defeats in the league, and is challenged by the quality of the front line.
The Australian media named Honda as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not strictly a striker, can fill a hole buried by Andreas Pereira.
He also pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to move away from the Cambodian representative's entertainment and gain full attention."
Will Honda's approach succeed?
It is also notable that United will move forward for the veterans who will be participating in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Completion of installation of 500 portable translation machines for free at Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce, stores, etc. | Shizuoka Shimbun
Poketalk is a portable translation machine that lends free of charge to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on June 26 that it has completed a total of 500 installation of Poketalk, a portable translation machine, at its member office.
It is said that it is the first time in the country to deploy the translator in the same area, and it is attracting attention to whether it will lead to improved inbound capacity.
The number of lenders is 236 restaurants, 113 stores, 17 accommodations, and 134.
The city's central district accounts for 60%.
He also started to show the lenders to the map app "Google Maps", and made it possible to see the location of a foreign language store on his smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan for Poketalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative declared by nine organizations in Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound cheering city in Japan.
The Chamber purchases 500 units, and leases them for two years to small and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We would like to connect to the development of new foreign customers as the business environment is severe."
Today's Naoto Ikemura Hiroyo is no longer required to make a first match?
Today's Caddie Best Shot
The 1W shot is not necessarily a ti-up.
There is also the so-called "Direct Dora" technique, which is used to hold a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance with the second shot of par 5.
The recent 1W has a large head volume, so there is a risk that the ball is scattered, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroyo is waiting for his first victory.
The 24th-year-old is 166 cm in height and is currently ranked seventh in the driving distance division (average 304.02yd).
While he was good at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of fairwaywood.
In the early spring, "The shot of a spoon (3W) was not good, so I thought I would try a direct dora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass in the area, and sometimes the ball is sprinkled with 1W.
In cases where a big carry is required, it uses a lot of ti-ups, but the two sides are making effective use of the direct dora in narrow halls.
"It can be used in the hall where the eye line is being knocked down."
In the ballistic instruments, 270yd-280yd was recorded on carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W, and I think I can feel more relieved than 3W with the caddy ...."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17° UT.
We are also pleased to hear the voice of exclamation leaking from the gallery that we saw in the war, which is surprising from our friends.
The trick is to "shape the club horizontally."
"Even if I hit the lower blow or the upper, I don't fly straight; if it's a cut track, I'll go to the right; I've been doing a straight drag to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the time of ti-up) and the attack angle (at the angle of entry of the club) becomes moderate in this practice."
The ball is not caught, and it is accompanied by a risk of slices, but "So the left side can be turned off (the left side does not turn).
It's a professional skill that makes you think that you're going to say to Kantan...

Swedish environmental activist Greta Tounberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech has been gaining attention, there have been calls out to insult Greta.
[Tweet collection] Greta Toonbei "Why do the adults laugh and threaten their children?"
A political critic told Greta about her on an American TV show that she is mentally ill and is being used by parents and international leftists.
On the internet in Japan, there are a lot of reports on Mr. Greta's comments, such as "I'm sorry to have been using it" and "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter, "Why do the adults spend time laughing and threatening teens and children?"
"I will come up with lies and conspiracy theories as far as I can think."
Greta says, "You have started again, and as you notice, those who dislike me are still active, and I'm following my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I'm different from others, and they come up with lies and conspiracy theories that they can think of."
They pointed out that they did not want to deal with climate and environmental crises, but they seemed to be holding down the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why the adults spend time laughing and threatening teens and children.
In that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
The change is coming.
Even if the adults like that change, they don't like it.
Meet on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20th, the previous week, climate change strikes were held in New York and other parts of the world.

I was able to reach a certain degree in the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I couldn't stretch it because it didn't work well.
Can you see the 6th Eagle and 7th Buddy?
Even after hitting Boggy at 4th, the par 5 was still left, so if I had been doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip-in-eagle was tight at 6th.
I was able to get a chance even at #7, but I was regrettable that I couldn't reach it in the second half.
What did you get at this tournament?
It was a good idea that I could keep it well even though the fairway was a narrow course because I didn't feel good recently.
It was a course where rough, straight and opposite eyes were different, and the distance was changed, so I didn't have much experience, so I learned a lot.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I did a lot of videos for galleries.
I didn't have much change other than that, but it was a competition where there were few Japanese players in co-hosting, so I decided to play the game with the feeling of "I won't lose to overseas players."
The second half of the race will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you won't be able to aim for the king of the prize, so I want to win another, and there is the ZOZO championship at the close, so I will do my best to get the qualification to compete at the top of the competition.
What are the ways to prevent dementia from becoming a "forgot"?
Interview/Text/Watanabe Yo
Drugs with dementia that have been frustrated when major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are challenging research and development.
However, it has become clear that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is becoming clear, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital I talked to Prof. Shunsuke Otsuki.
Dementia does not exist.
What is the current situation? - Dementia prevention or drugs are long-awaited.
Otsuki: It may be different from mild to severe, but if everyone is older, it may become dementia.
However, it is believed that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donetpezil, which is commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and it is not possible to expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people have been able to live for a long time, as cancer deaths have decreased due to infectious diseases and accidents, and cancer deaths have also decreased due to aggressive advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
It is also true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is necessary to create an environment where people can live in peace of mind in the community as a whole, not only by themselves and their families.
How to keep things in mind
Are there any people who are prone to dementia or are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as you can and keep them to "forgot things".
Dementia is considered to be one of the lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be more prone to people.
First of all, metabolic syndrome is prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.
The presence or absence of economic power is also affected.
For example, in the U.S., there are areas where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizza and chicken that can be stored.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in an environment where cooking is not possible can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with fewer vegetables and proteins, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased by lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, it is poor, but it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing it, you have to look at the TV, and your body is free.
A similar situation can also be in Japan.
In addition, people who don't think about things or don't work are prone to dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things from time to time.
