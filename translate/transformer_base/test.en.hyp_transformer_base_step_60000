High heels are dangerous!
Auto Messe Web - Yahoo!News
A violation of road traffic law
In recent years, the number of reported incidents has been increasing due to incorrect operation of pedals.
The number of cases of pedal mistakes by age (reported by the National Police Agency in 2015) has been increasing at 1080 cases under 24 years of age.
It is important for young people to be aware of these mistakes.
Do you take your feet down?
Do you take safety?
This data does not describe the gender ratio or cause of the disease.
In particular, women often choose different shoes depending on their clothes, such as high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules.
Some people know that it's not suitable for driving, but it's troublesome to change their shoes.
However, driving with high heels and sandals is in conflict with road traffic laws.
The first is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations.
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the operator must comply with the conditions stipulated by each prefecture's Public Safety Commission.
Even in each prefecture, it is not stated as "high heels," but it is the same principle that it is considered to be a violation of "the shoes that may hinder operation."
Why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It's easy to think about the basics of pedaling.
In order to ensure safe pedal operation, we first place our feet on the floor, then place our feet vertically against the brake pedal, and then, when we step on the accelerator pedal, we place our feet on the right side.
In this case, it is important to keep it firmly in place, regardless of the car's behavior.
However, with high heels, the surface of the heel is small and the heel is always blurred.
This could lead to danger.
Most of the cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to attach to high heels.
In addition, there are cases where heels are caught behind the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer able to return.

There were 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by 9 from last year.
Why is it a child cafeteria now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, the president and social activist of the NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the event at a lecture held in Sakai City.
As a result of the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely.
There was no place for people to meet.
"There was a need for people to interact with each other."
It is also a "multi-generational exchange" where elderly people participate.
In addition to eliminating the need for self-eating, it also helps to support child-rearing and healthy elderly people.
It cuts through the chain of poverty and revitalizes the region.
The most important thing is, "Don't make children who will be left behind."
There are various places to eat every day.
There are a variety of venues, from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere is becoming more and more people want to do.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure a management and staff.
We may ask questions such as safety management systems.
"Connecting with society becomes a safety net for disasters," says Yuasa.
It's like a light of hope for a closed society.

"Ababeer, an Iranian drone that was used in this bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the crashed American drones in recent years.
It can be manufactured at a low price.
Toru Yokota, a journalist, said, "It's not easy to catch the radar because it flies low."
Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Alamco, was bombed by 10 military drones on September 14.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fushi-ha" released a statement.
"There is no doubt that the country behind the Husi is Iran, led by President Rouhani, who is unable to export crude oil.Iran is unable to allow the hostile Saudi Arabia to make a profit with crude oil.If Iran continues its embargo, it is hoped that the international community will be aware of the pain in response."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production was halted and crude oil prices surged 15%.
Some people say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has pledged to withdraw the U.S. military from the Middle East, I would like to avoid military interventions until the next year's elections are over," he said, "Iran will continue to bomb the Fusi with drones, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "voluntary war" are in danger.

YouTuber has become so popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use them to advertise their products, some companies have begun to adopt YouTuber as a regular employee.
Direct Marketing Mix (DmMiX), a company that specializes in customer management.
What does YouTuber mean?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, the president of DmMiX and the representative of YouTuber's subsidiary and staff-first, was interviewed.
I want to support young people who are working hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption?
YUKI KOBAYASHI : Today, YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
The number of young people who are aiming for the future is increasing.
In the past, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue their dreams, such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, the youth who pursues the dream of becoming YouTuber and wants to support them is "YouTuber".
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people have longed to become YouTuber, most YouTubers have a reality that they don't get what they think.
There are many creators who make videos and post while working part-time.
In this effort, we will provide a pay and content creation environment for selected creators.
At first, we would like to support the demerits of YouTuber's profession, which inevitably becomes unstable.

"Korea wishes to return to GSOMIA" - Yahoo!
Mr. Napper, Assistant Secretary of State for the U.S. and Japan, said on November 27 that he would like to rethink Korea's decision to destroy it and return it.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the reconfirmation of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing information on missile launches.
In August, Korea announced that it would abandon the agreement with Japan.
"We can't respond effectively without GSOMIA."
"There is time to revocation," he urged Korea to return.
"It's the first time in history," he said.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as a result of the fact that the U.S.'s profits have been hurt.
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said.

Cherry shrimp in growth process PT, water depth of 290 meters in Shizuoka City|Shizuoka Shimbun
Sakura shrimp was born this year in Suruga Bay.
The Yui Sakura Ebi Project, an industry-academia-government-academia-government organization in Shizuoka City, has succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp, which is thought to have been born during the spring/summer season of this year.
The video of the growth process is valuable.
The photograph was taken at the bottom of the ocean, about 1-5 km off the coast of Kambara, Shimizu-ku, the city.
I checked about 300 cats in 17 minutes.
During the day, the traditional knowledge that sakura shrimps in the deep sea form a certain population on the seabed was reaffirmed.
The adult body was about 40mm in length, and the target was about 23mm in length.
We identified the spawning period by matching the seasonal data of the caught shrimp.
For more details, please contact Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Institute of Technology.
Keisuke Mizuno, Project Leader, says, "I want to capture the lives of individuals who have grown up, including young shrimp."

Kento Momota, the world's champion, will take the lead!
<Men's Singles>
The Japanese national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Barsel, Switzerland) held in Badminton in August, will participate in China's OP (China Super1000), which will be held in early September.
Here, we will look back on the first half of the Olympic race from May to August.
The first Badminton Olympic race was held in May.
In the first half of the race, the team won the second place in the four competitions.
Toda is the world championship, and Shutensei is the Indonesian OP (S1000) and the world's top spot.
In addition, Momota has also taken the Japan OP (S750).
The tournament has been held since May.
Although there are few other top players in the game, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the player.
In August, only one World Championship was held.
A good result is required in the mid-range game where the top tournaments from September continue.
Taiwan's ace is strong in a row.
We're looking forward to seeing young Thai artists!
Shu Tensei, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
He also participated in the Taipei OP (S300) in September.
He was originally a player who had a strong physical strength and didn't struggle in a series of battles.
Even if the tournament continues, there's no problem with the game's performance.
In the first half of the year, the team was able to score high points, making it easier for them to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournaments.
Although it seems that Shun Tensei had lost his ability to explode until last year, he was able to continue his good performance thanks to his increased stability in the game.
For Momota, who ranks highest in the world's rankings, it's likely that he's become a more difficult person.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was the result of the first half of the game.
There were three European players, Anders Antonsen.
Although Cantafón has not entered the finals at the top of the tournament, he has also entered the top four in the second tournament this season.
It's still rough, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th) who is now able to compete with the top runners has a great potential to jump in the race.
Si Pranys B. also took a step out of India, where he had a lot of good singles.
Samir Balama, Planoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late in the Kega, will continue to drive up in the future.
New charges for mobile phone: Hokkaido Newspaper
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released.
However, it remained high.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said that there was room for a 40% reduction last summer.
A major factor is the fact that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been postponed, and the number of three major companies has remained unchanged.
For consumers, it is preferable to have a system of pricing that is easy to use.
I would like to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits a set discount on terminal charges and telecommunications charges.
This is because, instead of selling the terminal fee cheaply, communication fees were higher.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to make their devices up to half.
Both companies, however, use SIM locks for 100 days.
NTT DoCoMo will make up to one-third of the device's total number of subscribers.
The three companies seem to have continued to "enclose" to prevent the transfer to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has stated that it is necessary to immediately terminate SIM lock.
Companies need to respond quickly.
It is said that the postponement of Rakuten could not proceed as planned.
It was expected that it would be a trigger for lowering the price, so it was a good fit.
Is it that the outlook was sweet?
There is no clear indication of the start of the full-scale service.
As a company that plays a leading role in social infrastructure, I hope that we will take responsibility for our business.
Mr. Suga's comment on the revision of the price was the trigger.
Mr. Suga complained about the three companies' new rates, saying, "I think the competition is going to start, and I don't think it's going to happen."
However, it is hard to believe that the lowering of the government's prices will distort the market and encourage a healthy competition.
Businesses should be able to compete in a customer-oriented manner prior to the government.
The price structure of each company is very complicated and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Bureau urged consumers to pay attention to the fact that consumers' burdens may exceed half the amount of money, even though the device has been advertised as "the maximum amount."
In order to avoid the misconceptions of users, companies must be careful and understandable.

[Rugby World Cup] 一発行と戦戦 米国人の「faced danger tackle」の海外の波 crest「反射ないないプレ」 ( THE ANSWER ) - Yahoo!News
In the U.S., FL Kile played rough, and was the former representative of England.
Japan's Rugby World Cup was the last tournament in 20 countries.
In the latter half of the film, a rough play played by FL John Quill called the ripples.
It's like adding a shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.
The international media also released the actual scene with videos.
[Video] "It's an insulting and poor play" and overseas ripples!
The real moment of the "faced danger tackle" played by the U.S. representative Kyle.
It was a hot fight.
It was 29 minutes.
Farel, the captain of England, had a little bit of a balance when he caught his ally.
I went to Tackle.
However, the upper body is not lower than the lower body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with the person's head.
Farel was blown up and fell.
The British protested against a clear lack of legitimacy.
Both of them gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle was able to get out with a red card.
Although he left the pitch with a bad face, some of the spectators asked for fair play.
"Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave the game with poor play and England will win."
"Kill had a poor shoulder charge on the face of Farel, an English star," he said.
In this article, we will introduce the comments of former British national and commentator Ugo Mogna.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The U.S. lacked a single-player, but the U.S. managed to get out of the box at 81.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad taste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced on September 26 that the number of 424 hospitals in Japan, including 1455 public hospitals and JR-Akas, was "possibly poor."
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reviewed the achievements of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.
⇒Reorganization Targeted 4 Hospital
In order to reduce medical expenses, which is increasing due to the aging population, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, the target hospital requested a full-scale review of the reorganization and consolidation of the hospital.
Although there is no force to force, the local mayors and residents are expected to be repulsed because of their anxiety about the disappearance of hospitals.
It was announced at the same day's meeting.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%.
By prefecture, the ratio was higher in Niigata, Hokkaido, Miyagi, Yamaguchi, and Okayama.
Okinawa was the only one.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, based on data from FY2017, investigated 1455 hospitals for the "Advanced Acute Phase" of public and public hospitals for severe patients and for the "Acute Phase" of general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical treatments, including cancer and emergency medicine, as well as the location of competing hospitals within 20 minutes by car.
In the case of a hospital that is eligible for the treatment, the hospital will be considered to be abolished, and some departments will be transferred to another hospital.
The number of medical expenses increased in the past 25 years.
As a result, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare aims to reduce the number of beds in a hospital with a total of 124,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are a large number of beds in the "Advanced Acute" and "Acute" stages where nurses are heavily deployed and medical expenses are required.
In order to respond to the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of the hospital, we have formulated the "Regional Medical Concept" which sets out the number of beds required by each prefecture for 25 years.
The government has divided the whole country into 339 areas, with local governments and medical professionals discussing the issues.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to stimulate discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Newspaper) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on January 27 that it has revised the Anti-Edict Guidelines to prevent the spread of Ton cholera, an infectious disease of livestock.
The target region will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of living pigs and fertilized eggs, which were vaccinated, is restricted to the intraregional area, but the distribution of meat and processed products is recognized.
After receiving public comments from the public, we aim to complete the procedure in October.
By using vaccines and recognizing the distribution of meats and other meats, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations, which may affect the export of pork.
Since the beginning of September last year, Japan's clean state has been on hold.
Based on the opinions of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set up a recommendation area for vaccination.
The relevant prefectures create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope of vaccination, the period of time, the number of heads, and how to proceed.
Other seven prefectures that have been recommended for vaccination include Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
The local government will review the situation when the guidelines are revised.
In principle, the movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, and pulsating objects is restricted to the region.
In the field of meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers.
In order to prevent the virus from spreading, we thoroughly treat food waste.
We also try to prevent harmful rumors.
The amendments to the Guidelines were finalized at the meeting held on the same day.
In the future, we will conduct public comments and opinions on prefectures until October 7th, and implement a new policy for prevention and prevention.
Keisuke Honda, who is a member of the group, is a public approach!
"Don't Pay Money" ( Football Channel ) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League.
[Video] Keisuke Honda: Did you actually play in the game?
The truth of God is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on the 27th day of Japan, said, "Please give us an offer, you don't need money, but you've got to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world-renowned company.
Why did Honda make a huge request to one of the best clubs in the Premier League?
The reason for this is in the article "FOX Sports" released on 24th.
"The five FWs that Manchester United is likely to be caught in the crisis of the number of injured."
Among the athletes, Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda's name was also included.
At the moment, UNITED KINGDOM continues to face a number of injuries, including MF Paul Poguva, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marsal and FW Marcus Rushford.
The red devil, led by Aure Gunner Suur Shar, has been forced to slide down to 2 to 22 in the league.
As a result, the Australian media named Honda as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, "Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill a hole buried by Andreas Pereira."
"The 33-year-old Honda needs to be out of his past and get a lot of attention."
Is Honda's approach true?
For the next year's Tokyo Olympic Games, it's a great opportunity for the United to move forward.

Kansei Ikemura, a famous figure of Naodora, doesn't need a tip-up at first?
Today's Caddie's Best Shot
The 1W shot isn't always up.
There is also the so-called "直ドラ" technique, which allows you to hit a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second shot of a par 5.
In recent years, 1W has a large head volume, which means that the ball is scattered.
It's Kansei Ikemura who can wait for his first victory.
The 24-year-old is 166cm tall.
One of the challenges was fairwaywood accuracy.
"I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W), so I thought I'd like to try it out."
From the practice round, the ball can be dropped on the grass in the area, and the ball can be turned off as much as 1W.
In the case where big carry is required, we often use ti-ups.
"You can use it in a hall where your eyes are laid down."
In the bullet train, it recorded 270yd-280yd with carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood was only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
The way of the tour is amazing, and I'm glad to hear from the gallery.
The best way to do this is to move the club to a level.
"I don't fly straight, even if I'm downblown or on the upper.I'm going to go right when I'm on the cut track.I've been doing a straight-dra to correct the swing of a 1W shot.
The ball doesn't get caught, and the risk of the slices comes from "So the left side can be turned off (does not turn left).
It's a professional skill that can't help but say to Kantan...

Mr. Greta Thunberg, a Swedish environmental activist who delivered a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.

They pointed out that they did not want to deal with climate and environmental crises.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
That time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened.
But don't spend your time paying attention to them any more.

It's also possible to shoot a camera.
I didn't care about it at all.

How do we prevent dementia from happening?
Interview/Text/Watanabe
A major pharmaceutical company and a university hospital have been trying to develop dementia drugs.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been clarified.
I asked Prof. Shunsuke Otsuki of Kinki University Hospital.
There is no need for dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to serious, it is possible for everyone to become dementia if they age.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donetpezil, which is commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance coverage in some countries, and it is not possible to expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased.
As a result, the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not possible to solve problems only by themselves and their families, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting.
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if you can't avoid getting dementia, there is a possibility that you can stop symptoms as much as you can, and keep them as "forgotten".
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases.
Metabo people tend to become dementia.
Dementia is one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence and absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity.
In this way, it becomes a diet with little vegetable or protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased towards lipids and sugars.
In time, poverty is becoming obese.
It's a very similar situation in Japan.
In addition, people who don't think about things or don't work tend to get dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things in a daily manner that is not metabolized.
