driving with high heels is dangerous!
there's a lot of accidents involving young people on the pedal.
violation of the road traffic law
it's a big mistake to think that it's only an old driver's problem.
according to the 2015 pdc data, there are more than 1032 cases of people under the age of 24.
it's important that young people be equally careful.
do you want to take your feet?
are you safe?
this data doesn't have a gender ratio or cause, but unlike older people who tend to come from the decline of their driving skills, reflexes, etc.
especially women who choose to drive with high heels, pamps, sandals, mules and other shoes that day.
some people know that it's not suitable for driving, but some people don't think it's dangerous.
but driving with high heels and sandals is against road traffic laws.
one is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and the 70th article, the violation of the safety driver's obligation to make sure that you don't drive in case of an accident.
and the other is that the driver must abide by the provisions of the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in the case of miyazaki prefecture road traffic law, do not drive a vehicle in a way that prevents them from wearing or driving
it's the same as the purpose of violating driving in the shoes that might prevent driving.
so, why is highheel driving dangerous?
it's obvious if you think about the basics of pedaling safely.
to make sure that the pedals are safe, the first thing is to stick their legs on the floor, put their feet vertically against the brake pedals, and when they step on the axel pedals, they turn their feet to the right.
at this time, it's important to keep it firmly locked, regardless of the behavior of the car.
but in high heels, the size of the heels is small, always glamorous, and the height of the heels makes it harder to adjust the area of the foot to the pedal.
this could be dangerous.
and most of the cars have floor carpets, but these materials tend to have high heels, and sometimes they can't stand behind the pedals when they're brakes.
and there are also cases where the heels are stuck behind the pedal and the axel pedals are gone.

i'm sure that president lohani's behind the fusi faction is an iran, and iran doesn't allow a hostile saudi arabia to make oil under circumstances that cannot export oil.
after the bombing, half of saudi arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices jumped 15 percent.

i heard mr. hayashi yuuki, the president of dmmix and the representative of staff first, the company that youtuber was hired.
i want to support a young man who works hard with youtuber.
what is it?
yuki kobayashi: now youtuber's profession has become a longing for many young people.
the number of young people who are going to go to school is increasing.
so far, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing bandmen and laughers
in the same way, the young people who are chasing after their dreams of becoming youtuber
i think you think that youtuber is an individual who voluntarily posts videos
kobayashi: while many young people admire the profession of youtuber
there are many creators who work parttime and produce and post videos, and creators who can't allow their family to be YouTuber.
in this effort, we will provide the creators with an environment for pay and content.
at first, i think we're going to support the demerit of a job called youtuber that's in a very unstable position.

he said, without gsomia, we can't respond effectively to the crisis.
there's time to relapse.
it was the first time in the history of the joint flight training that naka and russia conducted in july over the japan sea and said, it's essential that the united states and the republics share their values, democracy and human rights.

the first half of the bad olympic race!
boys singles!
the japan national team who won six medals at the 25th world championship in badominton in august, will compete in the chinese op starting from the 17th.
i'm going to look back on the first half of the next year's tokyo olympic race from may to august, and i'm going to look forward to the men's singles for the middle division of september.
the badminton olympic race, which started in may, digested four of the top players in the world championships.
the two of you who kept good in the first half were the two of you who won the second round of the four tournaments, michito momota and zhou tiancheng in Taiwan.
momoda won the world championship, shutennari won the s1000 and the world ranking points directly to the olympic race.
momoda also runs the japan op 750.
the tournament that's going to be held in may is the sdilman cup, the indonesia op, the indonesia op, the indonesia op.
compared to the other top players, it's a schedule that reduces the burden on them.
august was the only one at the world championships, so it's not going to be more exhausting than during the battle.
from september to september
the ace of taiwan.
young thailand!
zhou tiancheng, who also won the Indonesian oop and tai op, has already competed in seven tournaments.
in september, he also competed in the local taipei op (s300) and won the best.
it's a player who doesn't suffer a series of battles.
even if the tournament continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
until last year, shutennari had an impression of lack of explosives, but this year, he was able to continue his performance.
for momota, the world's number one, it's going to be more difficult than ever.
in the first half of the game, besides these two players, the young taii ace cantaphon and cy pranys b.
and the three men of the european army, anders antonsen.
kantafon's not going to the finals at the top of the competition, but he's going to go to the top of the competition, and he's going to go to the top.
there's still a rough side, but the 20yearold, 21 years old, who was able to compete with the top players, seems to be the most likely person in the olympic race.
sai pranys b. also took a step out of india, where he had a good player in singles.
samir barama, pranoy h.s., and slikans kiddambi, who's been late for injury, are going to be on the move.
new charges on the cell phone, fair competition, lowering the price: hokkaido newspaper
in october, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was launched.
but it almost stopped.
director suyoshi said last summer that there was room for a 40 percent reduction.
it's a big factor in the rapid entry of three major companies.
for consumers, it's preferable to be a more affordable toll system.
i want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
the amendment bans the set discounts of terminals and communications charges.
because instead of selling the terminals cheaply, the telecommunications fee was set to be higher.
Softbank and ddc (au) announced plans to make the terminal the largest and half.
however, both companies, for 100 days, sim locks that can't be used by other companies
NTT docomo is targeting only the contractor on its own line to a third of the terminal cost.
it's like the three companies continue to keep the perimeter to prevent the transfer.
regarding sim lock, the department of general affairs has issued a policy of immediate release.
the company needs to respond quickly.
the postponement of the escalator was because the base station and the network didn't go as planned.
he was expected to be the detonator of the competition.
i wonder if there was the sweetness of the prospect.
it's not clear when or how to start the service.
as a company responsible for social infrastructure.
this time, the price change was triggered by director sugawa's remarks.
sugawa complained about the new cost of three companies: i think the competition is going to begin.
but i don't think the lowering of government value will distort the market
the company should develop a customerlevel competition before they get kicked out of the government.
it's very complicated, not easy to compare.
the consumer agency has called attention because the terminals are making ads that make up half the price
you have to be careful and easy to explain yourself.
the money limit is 500,000 yen.
the three credit vaults in mie prefecture, iseueno credit vault and kihoku credit safe deposit box, announced on the 26th that they had decided to lower the cash limit to prevent the damage to the special scam.

[video] insulting and submissive play and overseas ripples!
the real moment of face danger tackle played by the u.s. representative kyle
hot fighting spirit crossed the line.

the captain of england, farrell, who was very strong, broke his balance when he caught his pass.
this was kyle.
but he didn't come down from his waist, but he took up his upper body and hit his upper body.
as a result, the person's head and head are in contact with the person's head.
farrell was blown up and fell.
the englanders, obviously lacking legitimacy
both fighters gathered at once, and they became airborne.

the number of targets is 54 in hokkaido and the only one in okinawa is zero.
the ministry of health, based on 2017 data, investigated 1455 hospitals in the public and public hospitals that could deal with the acute phase for severe patients
nine medical records, including cancer and paramedics, and a competing hospital analyzed the location within 20 minutes of the car and determined the need to publish the hospital's name.
i'm going to think about abolishing some clinics and transferring some other clinics.
medical expenses will increase in the next 25 years, when all the mass generation is 75 years old.
that's why the ministry of labor is aiming to reduce the number of beds in 124,000 beds across the country.
now, there's a lot of beds in the highly acute and acute stages of medical care, but there's no need for rehab.
to deal with aging, we need to reduce the number of beds and increase rehabilitation.
in order to reorganize and integrate the hospital, the prefectural government has created a regional health plan that defines the number of beds required for 25 years.
we've divided the country into 339 districts, municipalities and medical professionals, but many of the local residents and emirs have been careful, and it's difficult to discuss.

unaffiliated honda keisuke, open approach to manuu!
i don't need money.
928.
last season, he left melbourne victorie of the australia a league, and the former representative of japan, motoda keisuke, who is currently out of control
honda keisuke, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
honda, who updated his twitter on the 27th, said, don't need money, but you need to play with a great team or a great teammate.
the one who sent the counter offer was Manchester united.
why did honda make a grand request to the premier league club?
it's a story in the 24th edition of fox sports.
in an article called the five fws that manchester united might be able to hold in the crisis, five unaffiliated players were picked up.
the names of honda were among the athletes Hatem ben alpha, juzeppe rossi and wilphredo bonnie.
now in united, there's a lot of injuries, including mf paul pogba, dv luke shaw, df erik biley, fw tony malchal and fw marcus rushford.
the red devil, led by orre gunner sulshar, has been forced to slip in the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and has a problem with the quality of the front line.
so it was honda that the australian media named him as a candidate for a new force for the taco.
the article says, technically, honda's contract as a creative side player can fill the hole andreas perila is buried.
nine points in 18 matches at the melbourne victory is a solid record, but it's also pointed out that the 33yearold honda needs to get a full attention away from his entertainment to manage the representative of cambodia.
is that true?
the next year's tokyo olympics will be the target for veterans.
500 mobile translators completed.
it's a portable translation machine that lends it to 500 stores in matsumatsu city
on the 26th, the chamber of commerce announced that they've completed 500 of them in the city of matsumatsu.
it's the first time in the country to deploy the same machine in the same area.
the rentals are 236 restaurants, 113 stores, 17 accommodations, 134.
it's 60 percent of the city.
i started showing the loan address to the map app google map, so i could use my smartphone to see where the foreign language stores are.
from the hamana lake tourist area.
the free loan for the 74 languages began in april with the initiative of nine cities in the city to declare the japan's inbound support city.
the Chamber of Commerce buys 500 cars, rents them for two years to a small and mediumsized company that meets the requirements of hospitality, cashless payments.
the representative at the same office said, i'd like you to build a new foreign customer while the business conditions are tight.
ikemura hiroyo, you don't need to tiup again?
today, mr. caddy's best shot.
one w shot isn't necessarily a tieup.
there's a technique called the straightdra, which is to play the ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance from the second blow of per 5.
the recent onews have a high head volume, and they're risking the ball to scatter, but there are players who practice this on the ground.
ikemura hirose, who can wait for the first time on the tour.
he's 24 years old. he's 166 cm tall, he's 7th in the driving resistance division.
but one of the challenges was fairwaywood's accuracy.
i didn't have a shot of a spoon, so i thought i'd try a straightaway.
from the practice round, i put the ball on top of the grass in the area, and sometimes i'll swing one w.
in the case where big carrie is required, we use tiup, but both sides use a small hole to make use of the dora.
it can be used in the hall where the eye line is going to collapse.
in the ballistics machine, carrie recorded 270yd280yd.
that's why i don't need 3 w. caddie says that you can feel better than 3 w.
from the japan tour championship in june, wood's only one w in the caddy bag.
the second longest club is loft 17 degrees ut.
i'm also happy that the rules of war that we're surprised by from our tour companions are leaking from the gallery we saw.
the trick is to swing the club to level.
even if you hit the lower blow, you don't fly straight to the right if it's a cut trajectory. originally, you used to do a direct drag to correct the swing of a 1w shot.
so you can turn the left side off.
it's a professional technique that can't be helped.

what is the way to prevent dementia from happening and to forget?
interview.
a drug of dementia that has failed to challenge research and development.
but the relationship between dementia and living habits has been solved, and it's possible that it can be very mild and forgetful.
i spoke to professor otsuki shunsuke at kinki university hospital.
no dementia.
what is it?
even though otsuki's mild to severe, it's possible that everyone gets older.
but it's believed to take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
a drug called done pesil, which is used in japan, is already out of insurance in some countries, and it's not expected to be a significant cure.
on the other hand, people have been able to live longer, as the deaths of infectious diseases and accidents have decreased and the deaths of cancer have decreased with the treatment of cancer.
that's the fact that the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
we need to create an environment in which people and families can not solve it.
how to forget things
are there people who are susceptible to dementia?
otsuki, even if it's inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can stop the symptoms as much as you can.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases, and tends to be more susceptible.
first, metabo people tend to be more susceptible to dementia.
dementia is considered one of the lifestyle diseases.
it's a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol.
and the lack of economic power.
for example, the u.s. distributes food tickets to the poor, and food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
we can't use gas or electricity, and we can use people who live in environments where we can't cook.
and then you're going to eat less vegetables and protein, and you're going to live a life that's biased towards fat and sugar.
in the end, they're poor, but they're obese, and when they do, they have to look at the tv, and they're free.
it could be japan.
and people who don't work tend to be dementia.
in other words, in order to prevent dementia, we need to think about things that are not metabolized.
