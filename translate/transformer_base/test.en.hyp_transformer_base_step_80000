Driving with high heels is dangerous!
Auto Messe Web - Yahoo!News
Violation against Road Traffic Law
It is a big mistake to think that this is only a problem for older drivers.
In the number of incidents of pedal failure by age (reported by the National Police Agency in 2015), there are more cases of 1080 cases under the age of 24, exceeding 1032 cases over the age of 75.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well as the elderly.
Take a foot leopard?
Take safety?
This data does not include gender ratios or causes, but differs from older people who are often thought to be due to physical weakness such as driving skills and reflexive nerves.
In particular, some women choose different shoes depending on their clothes, such as high heels, panps, sandals and mules.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people do not think that it can lead to danger at all times, and many people drive without fear.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violate the road traffic laws.
One is that "really operate the handle, brakes and other operations" and Article 70 "repeat the safety and duty of operation" which stipulates "Do not drive to cause accidents and harm to people".
The second is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters set forth by the prefectural public safety committee, "Violence of compliance with the Public Security Committee", for example, in Article 12 of the Road Traffic Act of Miyazaki Prefecture, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing footwear, slippers, trinkets, high heels or any other footwear that may interfere with the operation."
The aim of each prefecture is similar to that of violating the operation of footwear that may prevent operation even if it is not specified as high heels.
So why dangerous driving with high heels?
It's obvious if you think about the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor, then place the foot vertically against the brake pedal, then tilt the foot to the right as the starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep firmly fixed so as not to blur.
However, with high heels, the area where the heels are grounded on the floor is small and always blurred, and with an angle on the whole foot at the height of the heels, the area of the foot to ground on the pedal becomes smaller, and it becomes difficult to make fine adjustments.
This can lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull high heels, heels can not be pulled and pedals can not be trampled when the brakes are urgent, or high heels can be removed when the heels are pulled, and they can be stuck in the depths of the pedal.
In addition, when stepping on the pedal, heel pulls behind the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer able to return.

Is beauty and ugly a single piece of paper?
What is the "Snake" image that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu's works (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Mystical beauty and the expression of shadows in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and in August 2019, "The Collection of the Beautiful Girl and the Beautiful Girl" (Genkosha) was launched, focusing on the beautiful girls drawn by Mr. Kazuo Baizu, who is known as the leading figure in horror manga.
When you take a look at it, you will notice the correlation between beauty and fear of Kazuo's work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Beautiful girls in the works of Kazuo Baizu (5 pieces)
In the preface of "Beautiful Girl Collection", there was a sentence that "fear, ugly, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only if they have their beauty in the opposite pole."
There is a keyword "snake" in the works of Kazuo Baizu, but snakes are captured as "eerie creatures" by the viewer, and people feel "beautiful" and various ways of receiving them.
Some people like reptilians in the world, and others just don't like them.
In such a way, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be the "snake" of a living creature in the outer world.
This creature has been revered as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the White Snake lived is auspicious.
His works on the theme of "Snake" include "Hyb Girl" and "Silver Girl" from the series "Mama Kowai!" in 1965.
Generally speaking, it is a beautiful woman with a shadow that becomes a "hebijo".
Is it good to say that it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is in common with the beautiful girls appearing in the works of Baizu.
Orochi, the main character of Orochi, which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's works, but it reminds me of a snake somewhere that creates deep sleep every hundred years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

Mr. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, deleted the comment on Twitter by the 27th when he ate a meal at Yakitoriya in Saga prefecture.
Mr. Yamamoto entered the prefecture on February 26 to explain the findings of the incident that the AH64D combat helicopter of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force crashed in February last year to local municipalities.
On the same day night, I visited Saga Prefecture on a business trip.
I posted comments such as "delicious" along with a photo of Mr. Kazuchika Iwata, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Defense of the same prefecture who attended the meal.
In the accident, a girl was injured in a house and two members were killed.
Yamamoto was elected in the Southern Kanto area proportionally four times.
[Etsuyama Wakamizu] A circle of "Children's Shokudo" that provides free or inexpensive meals to children spread throughout Japan.

There are 24 locations in Fukui prefecture, which increased by 9 times compared to last year.
Why is it now a cafeteria for children?
Makoto Yuasa, president of the NPO and social activist, spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.
The declining birthrate and aging population makes the area lonely and the shopping district declines.
No place for people to meet.
Therefore, there was a need for an exchange base in the area where people interacted.
It is a multi-generational exchange place where older people also participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also provides support for parenting and health for the elderly.
Cut the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
The important thing is not to create children who will be rejected.
From once a month to providing daily meals.
There are many venues ranging from several to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people want to do is becoming possible.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
We may hear issues such as a secure management system.
However, "Meeting with a lot of people will change your values.""Connecting with society will become a safety net in times of disaster," Yuasa said.
It seems like hope light with closed society.

"Ababir, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing crashed US military drones in recent years.
It can be manufactured inexpensively and has a range of approximately 1,000km.
Its strength is that it is difficult to capture by radar because it flies low in the sky."
On September 14, Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization Fusi in Yemen has issued a crime statement.
"It is certain that the country behind the Fusi is Iran led by President Rouhani, and Iran cannot allow its enemies Saudi Arabia to make a profit from crude oil under circumstances in which it cannot export crude oil.If Iran continues its embargo on crude oil, it is the aim of informing the international community that it will suffer accordingly."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and crude oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again if it remains.
"Since Trump has pledged to withdraw the US military from the Middle East, at least until the next year's elections are over, I would like to avoid military intervention, and Iran will continue to bomb the Fusi in the future, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever."
The U.S. and Iran's surrogate wars are facing immediate crisis.
Why did YouTuber become a full-time employee?
Ask the president who adopted it (bizSPA!)
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 Delivery
YouTuber is now extremely popular among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, but some companies have started a unique mechanism called "YouTuber Adoption" that they hire as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Inc. ("DmMiX") is a company's CRM (customer relationship management) business.
What does it mean to use YouTuber?
I talked to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, President of DmMiX, who is also a representative of the subsidiary staff first that YouTuber actually adopted.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber
What is the mechanism behind YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi (Kobayashi ) : Today, YouTuber has become a longing for many young people.
It is also ranked in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to enter in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are pursuing their dreams, such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "YouTuber Adoption" to recruit and support young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the career of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers can't earn what they want.
There are many creators who make videos and post while working part-time and creators who cannot allow their family to be YouTuber.
This initiative will provide an environment for creators to create salary and content.
At first, we would like to support activities by supporting the demerits of YouTuber, a profession that becomes unstable.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA" Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the United States - Yahoo!
Napper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the United States, in charge of South Korea and Japan, said on November 27, in response to a single interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, "I hope that Korea will rethink and return the decision to destroy it."
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the rethinking of GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the basis for sharing missile launch information and other agreements between Japan and Korea, Japan, the United States and Korea.
Korea will destroy the agreement with Japan in August, and the framework to protect military information will collapse if it expires.
"Without GSOMIA, we cannot respond effectively to the crisis."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat recognition that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea is "damaging the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap."

The four tournaments that have participated in since May are the Sudilman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/result 16 strong), Japan OP (July), and World Championship (August).
Although the number is small compared to other top players, the schedule has reduced the burden on them.
August was only one tournament of the world championships, so fatigue would not be greater than the series.
Good results are required for the top tournaments since September in a row.
Taiwan Ace strong in the series.
Watch for young Thai people!
He also won the top tournaments of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), and has already competed in seven tournaments.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the grand prize.
Originally, the physical is strong and the players who do not suffer the series.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by gaining high points in the first half.
Until last year, Zhou Tensei had an impression of lack of explosive power, but this year, the stability of the playing field increased, making it possible to continue with good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the result was in the first half of the race with Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Sai Pranys B. .
And three European players, Anders Antonsen, who are struggling with an isolated army.
Although Cantafone has not entered the finals in the top tournament, he has the power to advance to the top, including entering the 4th in the second tournament this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who has become able to rally equal to the top players has a great potential to leap into the Olympics.
Sai Pranys B. also stepped out of India, where he had a good player for singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoi H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who are late in the Kega, will also be driving up in the future, so be careful about the Indian forces since the midfield.
New mobile phone fee Fair competition to lower price: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new pricing plan for mobile phone companies came out following the enactment of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that there was room to lower the price by about 40% last summer. Despite rising expectations for lowering prices, price competition did not occur.
A major factor is that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been delayed and the oligopoly of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have an easy-to-use pricing system through fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and telecommunications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal bill, communication fees were set to be higher.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will charge up to one-third of the terminal costs for only subscribers on its own lines.
The three companies seem to continue "enclosing" to prevent transfer to other companies.
Regarding SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy to impose immediate release.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was due to the maintenance of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to become a detonator of the price reduction competition, so it looked like a shock.
Perhaps there was a sweetness of the outlook.
It is not clear when full-scale service starts or charges.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, we want to engage in business with responsibility.
The price revision was triggered by Kanbo's remarks.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the three companies' new fees, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, I don't think it's alright at all times."
However, the lowering of government prices does not distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Enterprises should develop customer-oriented competition before they can speak out from the government.
The pricing structure of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency has called attention to the fact that although the terminal offers advertisements such as "maximum half-price" the consumer burden exceeds half-price.
The company itself has to be careful and easy-to-understand to avoid misunderstood users.
Cash Card for Three Credits in Mie - Ise Shimbun
Three credit banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on the 26th that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawals by cash cards to prevent the damage of special scams.
Holding cash cards for each of Kuwana Mie, Kita-Ise Ueno and Kikita's credit safes, the maximum amount of 500,000 yen can be issued per day for depositors aged 70 years or older who have never made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years.
Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be lowered on October 1, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank will start on November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many cases of special scams issued by ATMs after spoofing cash cards and ID numbers for financial institutions and police personnel.

There are 12 wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt.Fujima, from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One Outing and Brawl The U.S. player's "Face Danger Tackle" with the overseas ripples "The insulting and subdued play" ( THE ANSWER) - Yahoo!
The FL Quill in the U.S. played rough, and the former English representative "It's not something to call tackles."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was the last tournament in 20 countries to be played on 26th, and the United States lost 7-45 to England.
In the latter half, the rough play played by FL John Quill called the ripples.
It is like adding a shoulder tuckle to the face of the opponent.
The international media also released the actual scene with video, and the former English national team also complained, "It's an insulting and sinister play," and "It's not something that can be called tackles."
[Video] An insulting and subservient play and ripples overseas!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by the US representative Kyle
A hot fight has crossed the line.
It was 29 minutes in the second half.
The English captain Farrell was somewhat unbalanced when he caught his path.
It was Kyle who went to Tackle.
However, the upper body was not raised from the waist, and the upper body violently hit.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell down.
The English player tried to push Kyle into a play that clearly lacked legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle is dropped by a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the spectators asked for fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand's local media "Staff" features "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave due to poor play and England wins".
"Kill had a poor shoulder charge on the face of Farrell, an English star player, and was forced to leave," he reports.
In the article, we introduce the comments of former England national team member Wogo Mogna.
"It's insulting, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play," he said.
The United States, who lacked a match, managed to leave the game in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left behind the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare released the first names of 424 hospitals in Japan, which were judged to have poor medical records among 1455 public hospitals and Japanese Red Cross hospitals.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the results of treatment of 14 public and public hospitals in Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of Awawara City.
⇒Reorganization target 4 hospital "Criteria Funny"
In order to curb the increasing medical costs due to the aging population, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we asked the target hospital for full-scale review of the reorganization and integration.
There is no compulsion force, but the local mayors and residents are expected to resist anxiety about the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The target hospital was 29.1% of the total, and the number of beds was relatively low.
By prefecture, the percentage was higher in the order of Niigata (53, 70%), Hokkaido (48,6%), Miyagi (47,5%), Yamaguchi (46,7%), and Okayama (43,3%).
The number was 54 in Hokkaido and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare surveyed 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can handle "high-level acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
We analyzed the medical records of nine items such as cancer and emergency medical care, and found that competing hospitals are not located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital is subject to consideration for the abolition and the transfer of some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses are surging in 25 years, when all mass generation members are over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in 1246,000 hospitals nationwide to 1191,000 beds.
Currently, the number of beds for "advanced acute" and "acute" that cost medical care by placing nurses is large, but the need for rehabilitation for elderly is scarce.
In order to respond to aging, it is necessary to not only reduce the number of beds but also increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, we formulated a "regional medical plan" with the number of beds required by each prefecture for 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 areas, and municipalities and medical personnel are in talks, but many of the local residents and mayors maintain a cautious attitude, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize discussions by announcing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Hokkaido Shimbun: Comprehensive Disaster Prevention Training for the Eruption of Mt.Komagatake, Roads, etc.
A comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held on September 27 in the forest, Nanae and Kabe town in the Toshima Kannai.
Approximately 400 people attended the event, including staff from 20 institutions and residents.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced on July 27 an amendment to the Epidemiological Guideline to prevent the spread of ton cholera, an epidemic of domestic animals, from spreading.
The target region is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefectures, which have confirmed infection with pigs and wild boars.
Moves such as live pigs and fertilized eggs are restricted in the region.
Through public comments to the public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as early as possible.
By using vaccines and permitting extra-regional distribution such as meat, the country is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been holding a state of cleanliness.
Based on the opinions of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has set up a recommended area for vaccination for wild boars and pigs.
The relevant prefectures will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope and time of vaccination, the number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures that are recommended for vaccination include Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
The region will review the situation once the guidelines have been revised.
Moves such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, dead bodies, and exclusivity are generally restricted in the region.
The meat and processed products are not subject to the costs of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers.
To prevent the virus from spreading, thoroughly process food waste.
It also appeals to the safety of immunized pigs to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Effective Headquarters.
In the future, opinion inquiries and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7, and new quarantine guidelines will be implemented.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke and Man U have a public approach!
"Please give the offer, money is not needed" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo!
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 Delivery
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League and the former Japan national team member Keisuke Honda took an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game.
The truth of the sky is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter on the 27th at midnight of Japan, said, "Please give us an offer, you don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to the Premier League's top brass club?
The story begins with an article in the Australian version of FOX Sports released on 24th.
In an article entitled "Five FWs that Manchester United could seize in the crisis of a series of injuries," five non-affiliated players were picked up.
Honda was also among the players Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie.
There are currently many injured in United, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcal and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by director Ole Gunner Surshar, has been forced to slide in the league, with 22 wins and 22 losses, and challenges the quality of the front lines.
Honda was named as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a strict striker, can fill the hole that Andreas Pereira fills.
He also pointed out that the 33-year-old Honda needs to be away from his entertainment to manage the Cambodian national team.
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward for the next year's Tokyo Olympics.
Completion of 500 portable translators Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
Poketalk is a portable translator loaned to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on March 26 that it has completed the installation of 500 units at stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is said to be the first in Japan to deploy the translators in the same region.
The breakdown of loans is 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations and 134.
The city's central district accounts for 60%.
We also started to view the location of foreign language stores on smartphones.
It is accessible from the Hamanako Tourism Area site.
The free loan of Poketalk corresponding to 74 languages began in April with the initiative to receive the Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu declared by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber buys 500 units and rents them for two years at small and medium-sized offices that meet the requirements of hospitality certification and cashless settlement.
The representative of the Chamber said, "We want foreign customers to develop new business environments."
Ikemura Hiroshi, a master of Naodra, does not need a tip-up for the first time?
Today's Caddy Best Shot
A 1W shot is not necessarily a tip-up.
There is also the so-called "director" technique of knocking the ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance with the second stroke of par 5.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which poses a risk of spreading the ball, but some players often practice it on the ground.
Ikemura Kansei waits for his first victory.
The 24th-year-old is currently ranked 7th in the driving distance category (average 304.02yd) with a height of 166cm.
While he excelled in long shots, one of the challenges was fairway wood accuracy.
In the early spring, I opened my eyes to try a dora because the shot of a spoon (3W) was not good.
From the practice round, you can put the ball on the grass in the area and sprinkle 1W.
In cases where Big Carry is required, Ti-up is often used, but both sides are making effective use of DCDRA in narrow halls.
It can be used in a hall where the eye line is laid down.
The ballistic instrument recorded 270yd-280yd from carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W, and I think I can feel more relieved than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the loft of 17 degrees UT.
I am also happy to hear from the gallery that I saw.
The trick is to swing the club horizontally.
"I don't fly straight, even if I hit downblows or uppers, I go to the right in the cut track, originally I was doing a direct dora to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of ti-up), and with this practice, the attack angle (the angle of the club's shooting) is also gradual."
The ball is not caught and is at risk of slices, but "So the left side can be turned off."
It's a professional technique that makes you feel unintentionally.

Publication of the original manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa | Shizuoka Shimbun
Written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, first published at Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall

Greta Thumbelli: "Why do the adults laugh and threaten their children?"
Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While that speech has been attracting attention, there has been a call to insult Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Tounbeli: "Why do adults laugh and threaten their children?"
Political critics said about Greta on an American television show that he was mentally ill and used by his parents and the international left.
In Japan, on the Internet, there are many outreaching comments on what Greta says, such as "We are using and sorry" and "We should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults use time to laugh and threaten teens and children?"
"I come up with the possible lies and conspiracy theories."
Greta said, "Look again, as you notice, the people who hate me are as active as ever, chasing my look, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come up with lies and conspiracy theories as far as they can think."
The adults did not want to deal with climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be struggling with the issue.
I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teens and children.
To that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to awaken.
Changes are coming.
Even if adults like that change or not.
Meet on the street on Friday!
A climate change strike was held in New York and other parts of the world on Friday 20th.
Greta also called on Friday 27th to do it.

Garcia wedge shot
I was able to reach some degree in the first half, so I thought I could go to the second half with that momentum.
Did you see the victory in the sixth Eagle and the seventh Bardy?
Even after I hit the buggy in 4th, the par 5 was still there, so I had to take it back and I had a chip-in eagle in 6th.
I was able to get a chance at number 7, but I regret that I couldn't reach it later.
What did you get in this tournament?
It was good that I could keep the fairway in a narrow course because it was not good.
It was a course where rough, forward and reverse eyes were different and the distance changed, so I did not have much experience, so I studied quite well.
What is the difference from the usual tournament?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all times, but the galleries were filming videos.
There were not many other things that changed, but it was a competition where there were few Japanese players in co-hosting, so I went to the game with the feeling that I would not lose to overseas players.
We will continue in the second half, but if one wins or more, we can't aim for the winning king, so I want to win another more, and there is also a ZOZO Championship nearby, so we will try to get the qualification to enter the top in the tournament.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of forgetfulness?
Report/Watanabe Yo
Dementia medicines that are frustrated by major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is becoming clear, and it seems that it may be extremely mild and forgetful.
Kinki University Hospital I spoke with Professor Shunsuke Otsuki.
Dementia should not disappear
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, depending on the degree of difference, everyone may become dementia after ageing.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance coverage in some overseas countries, and it is not expected to have a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people have been able to live longer while cancer deaths have decreased due to infectious diseases and accidents, and cancer deaths have also been reduced due to treatment of anticancer drugs.
It is also true that dementia patients are on the increase.
We need to create an environment where people can live comfortably in the community as a whole.
How to keep things to the degree of forgotten
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and to be "forget about".
Dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be prone to people.
First, metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity are not available and people living in an environment where cooking is not possible.
Then, it becomes a diet with few vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle biased by lipids and sugars.
In the end, poverty becomes obese, and when it comes to television, the body becomes unfree.
A similar situation can be in Japan.
Others do not think about things, people who do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books every day.
