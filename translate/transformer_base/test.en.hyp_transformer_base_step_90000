Driving with high heels is dangerous!
Auto Messe Web - Yahoo!News
Violation of Road Traffic Law
It is a big mistake to think that it is a problem only for older drivers.
The number of cases of error-prone pedal accidents by age (Source: The National Police Agency, 2015) was more than 1080 cases under the age of 24.
It is also important for young people to take care of them.
Do you take your feet?
Take safety?
There is no mention of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but it is different from the elderly who are thought to be caused by a decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes.
In particular, women choose different shoes depending on their clothing, such as high heels, pumps, sandals and mules.
While some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes.
However, driving with high heels and sandals violates the road traffic law.
Article 70: Violation of Safety Driving Obligations, which stipulates that "the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations shall be operated reliably" and "the operation shall not cause accidents and harm to people".
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Prefectural Public Safety Commission.For example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Law, there is a sentence that "Do not drive a vehicle (except for light vehicles) by wearing footwear in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle, such as slippers, straps, high heels, etc.
The aim of each prefecture is similar to that of a violation of "a footwear that can prevent operation" even if it is not specified as a high heel.
Why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It's clear to think about the basics of pedal operation.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor and place the foot vertically against the brake pedal.
At this time, regardless of the car's behavior, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that it does not shake.
However, with high heels, the area of the heel is small and the heel is always blurred.
This could lead to danger.
Most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to draw a heel's heel, and when the brakes are urgent, the heel can't be dragged and the pedal can't be trampled.
In addition, there are cases where heel is hooked on the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer able to return.

The local industry in Awaji Island, Hyogo, Japan, "Awaji tiles" manufacturing in Kinki Ceramics filed for quasi-self bankruptcy.
The sluggishness in the housing market and the frequent damage caused by the disaster caused the rise of consumer roofs.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd.(TDB Corporation Code: 530173983, capital: 96.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji-shi, Hyogo, Japan, CEO: Yukizo Fukuhara, 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant's representative is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8, Nishitenma, Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan), Daichi Yoshida Law Office, and 06-6365-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as an Ibushi tile manufacturer, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishi-Awaji-cho, Mihara-gun, Japan.
In October 1986, he took over the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., a merger of Kyowa Kiln Industry Co., Ltd., and moved the main store to its current business name.

The company has established a wide range of business bases in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction contractors.
It was well-known as the top tile manufacturer in Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, the demand for the roofing of the roofs of consumers has been sluggish.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decrease in profit margin due to the rise in fuel prices, the company faced a continuous loss due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory and business fixed investment.
As a result, financial institutions were seeking to rebuild their business by requesting financial institutions to reduce their debt repayment conditions.
This was the last step of the project, and the project was abandoned.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

When I look at it in my hand, I realize the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Umezu's work.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
5 beautiful girls of Kazuo Umezu
In the preface of "Beautiful Collection", there was a sentence that says, "The shocking scenes and developments of fear, ugliness, and stories stand out only when they have the beauty of the girls, but the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of grudges...
There is a keyword "snake" in the works of Kazuo Umezu, but the snake is caught as a creepy creature by the viewer.
Some people like reptiles and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the viewer's sensibility, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
This creature has been worshipped as a spiritually powerful creature since ancient times.
Umezu's works on the theme of "Snake" include "Habbi Shojo" and "Chira no Shojo" in the series "Mama ga Kowai!" in 1965.
It is a beautiful woman with a shadow.
Is it okay to say that it is a "cool beauty" type if it is a bad way to say ...
Orochi, the main character of Orochi, which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Umezu's work.

There are 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which has increased by 9 times compared to last year.
Why is it now a children's cafeteria?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, the president and social activist of the NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the event at a lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping street declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
Therefore, there was a need for an exchange center in the area where people interacted.
It is a multi-generational exchange place where the elderly also participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also supports child-care and health care for the elderly.
Cut off the poverty chain and revitalize the region.
What's important is that you don't create a child that starts from there.
From once a month to a place offering daily meals.
There are a wide variety of venues, from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere of people who want to do it is getting better.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
We may also hear about issues such as safe management systems.
"Connecting with society becomes a safety net in times of disaster," says Yuasa.
It seems to be a hope for a closed society.

"In recent years, Ababir, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing crashed US drones.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, and the range is about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that it's hard to catch a radar because it flies in the low sky."
On September 14, Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Fusi, announced a criminal statement.
"It is certain that the Iranians behind the Fusi are Iran led by President Rouhani, and Iran is not allowed to allow the hostile Saudis to make a profit with crude oil in a situation where their country cannot export crude oil.If Iran continues its embargo against the Iranians, it is the aim of informing the international community that there will be pain in response."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and crude oil prices surged by 15%.
Some people say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's commitment to withdraw the US military from the Middle East, I would like to avoid military intervention at least until the end of next year's elections, and I know that Iran will continue to bomb the Fusi in the future, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever.
The U.S. and Iran's proxy wars are at a standstill.
The reason I became a full-time employee of YouTuber.
Listen to the president(bizSPA!)
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now extremely popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising of their products, some companies have begun to adopt a unique system called "YouTuber adoption" in their own company.
Direct Marketing Mix Inc. (hereafter referred to as DmMiX) is a company's CRM (customer relationship management) business.
What does it mean to use YouTuber?
I interviewed Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, DmMiX's Representative Director, and the representative of the company's subsidiary, Staff First, who was actually hired by YouTuber.
Want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber?
What is the mechanism behind YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi : YouTuber is now a dream for many young people.
It is also ranked in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to go to in the future.
We have adopted and supported young people who pursue their dreams, such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, a young man who pursues his dream of becoming a YouTuber is hired to support him.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire YouTubers, there is a reality that most YouTubers can't get the money they want.
There are many creators who make videos and post while working part-time, and creators who don't allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this project, we will provide an environment for creators to pay and create content.
At first, we are trying to support the demerit of YouTuber, a job that will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" - Yahoo!News
Napper, U.S. Under-Secretary of State Affairs of the Republic of Korea and Japan, said on November 27 that Korea would like to reconsider the decision to abandon and return to the GSMIA.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the rethinking of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information and other information.
If Korea cancels its agreement with Japan in August, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
"Without GSOMIA, we can't deal effectively with the crisis."
"There is time to revocation," he urged Korea to return.
"It's the first time in history that the U.S., Korea and Japan share values such as democracy and human rights, must work together in an alliance."
The recent worsening of Japan-ROK relations has been pointed out as "injuring U.S. national interest."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "I will play a positive role in filling the gap between Japan and Korea."

Shrimp in the Growth Process PT, Shizuoka City|Shizuoka Shimbun
Sakura Shrimp was born this year in the deep sea of Suruga Bay on the 11th.
The Yui Sakura Shrimp Project, an industry-academia-government-academia-government marine industrial cluster association, was successfully shot at the bottom of the sea at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the participants are interested in elucidating the ecology of sakura shrimp.
The photograph was taken at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Kambara, Shimizu-ku.
We confirmed about 300 animals in 17 minutes.
During the day, the traditional knowledge that the deep-sea sakura shrimp are forming a certain population at the bottom of the sea was reaffirmed.
The adult body is about 40 mm in length and the individual image is about 23 mm in length.
The spawning period was identified by comparing the seasonal data of fried sakura shrimp.
For detailed analysis, we will ask Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Industrial Technology College.

[The first half of the BAD Olympic race] Kento Momota, the world's champion, will take the lead!
<Men's singles>(Bad x Spi!)
The Japan National Team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel (Switzerland), held a big event in badminton in August, will participate in the China OP (Jianzhou / Super1000) which will open from 17th to 17th.
Here, we will look back on the first half of the Olympic race from May to August, and look forward to the men's singles for the mid-season race from September to December.
The Badminton Olympic race, which began in May, digested four top-ranked tournaments (Super500+) at the end of the World Championship.
In the first half of the race, the two players were Kento Momota, who won the 2nd prize in the 4th tournament, and the other two in Taiwan, Zhou Tian Cheng.
In the world championship, Su Tensei won the tournament with the Indonesian OP (S1000) and the high points of "World Ranking Points" directly connected to the Olympic race.
In addition, Momota also has the Japan OP (S750).
In May, the team competed in four tournaments: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesian OP (July/result is over 16), the Japan OP (July), and the World Championship (August).
Although the number is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the team.
In August, it was only one of the world championships, so it would not be more exhausting than during the series.
Good results will be required in the mid-season, where the top tournaments after September are held.
Taiwan's ace that is strong in the series.
Featured by young Thai artists!
He also won the top tournaments of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500).
He also participated in the Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the grand prize.
He was originally a player who had a strong physical strength and didn't suffer a series of battles.
There is no big problem in the game's performance.
By winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Until last year, Shutensei seemed to lack explosive power, but this year, the stability in the play area increased, allowing him to continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, it's going to be more difficult than ever.
In the first half of the game, the result was the Thai young Ace Cantafung and Indian counterpart Sai Pranyse B. .
And three European players, Anders Antonsen, are struggling alone.
Although Cantafung is not in the finals at the top of the competition, he is also in the top 4 of this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is now able to do a rally equal to the top player has a great potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Pranís B. also stepped out of India, where he had a good match for singles.
Samil Balama, Pranoi H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been behind Kega, will also catch up in the future.
New Rates for Mobile Phones: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for mobile phone companies came out.
However, it generally stopped high.
Last summer, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that there was room for a 40% reduction.
The major reason is that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been delayed and the oligopoly of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have an easy-to-use pricing system through fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits set discounts on terminals and telecommunications charges.
This is because, instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
Softbank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to make the device up to half the price.
However, both companies can use SIM locks for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will charge up to one-third of the total cost of the device to the subscribers of the company.
The three companies seem to have continued "enclosed" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) issued a policy to require immediate release of SIM locks.
Companies need to respond as soon as possible.
The delay in Rakuten was due to the lack of infrastructure such as base stations.
It was expected to be a trigger for the lowering of prices, so it looked like it was worn down.
Isn't there a sweet prospect?
The start time and prices of the full-scale service are not clear.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I would like to work with responsibility.
This price revision was triggered by Mr. Suga's remarks.
Mr. Suga complained about the new price of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, I don't think it's going to be good."
However, it is hard to believe that the lowering of government-manufactured prices will undermine the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should compete in a customer-oriented manner before the government can speak out.
The price system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency has called attention to the fact that the consumer's burden is more than half the price, even when the device is advertising "up to half the price".
Companies should be careful and easy-to-understand in order to avoid misunderstood users.

【Rugby World Cup】Among the U.S. players' face danger tackles "Am insulting and poor play" ( THE ANSWER) - Yahoo!
U.S. FL Kyle played rough, former England representative, "It's not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup Japan tournament was held on 26th, and the United States, which was the last player in 20 countries, lost 7-45 in England.
In the latter half of the series, the rough play played by FL John Quill called the ripples.
It is like adding a shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.
The international media also released the actual scene with video footage, and the former England national team struggled to say, "It's an insulting and submissive play."
[Video] "A insulting and submissive play" and the ripples of overseas!
The actual moment of the face danger tackle played by the U.S. representative Kyle ...
A hot fighting spirit crossed the line.
It is the second half of the 29 minutes that I received at 0-38.
Farel, the captain of England, was a bit in balance when he caught his friend's pass.
I went to Tackle.
However, he wakes up his upper body, not from his waist.
As a result, the other person's head and the other person's head come into contact and press the head.
Farrell was blown up and fell down.
The English player is trying to push Kyle away in a clear lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an immediate atmosphere.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out with a red card.
Some of the spectators, who wanted to play fair, heard some booing.
New Zealand's rugby strong local media "Staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave the game with poor play and England wins".
"Kil had an understated shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farel, and he left."
In the article, we introduced the comments of Ugo Moña, a former English player and commentator.
"It's an insulting, submissive, not a tackle, it's a submissive play."
The U.S. lost one in the game, and the U.S. managed to win the match in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced the names of 424 public hospitals in Japan, including 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals.
⇒Reorganized 4 Hospitals "Corporate Funny"
In order to curb the growing medical expenses due to the aging population, we have to reorganize and integrate with hospitals in competing regions.
In October, we will ask for a full-scale review of the reorganization and integration of the hospital.
Local chiefs and local residents are expected to react to the lack of compulsion.
The meeting was announced on the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%, and the number of beds was relatively low.
By prefecture, the ratio was higher in Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, based on data from FY2017, surveyed 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can handle "high acute stage" for severe patients and "acute stage" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, as well as the location of competing hospitals within 20 minutes by car.
The target hospital will consider decommissioning and transferring some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses will surge in 25 years, when all baby boomers are over 75 years old.
To this end, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in hospitals with 12.46 thousand beds in 18 years.
Currently, the number of beds for "high-acute" and "acute" periods is large, but the need for rehabilitation for the elderly is insufficient.
In order to respond to the aging population, we need to not only reduce the number of beds, but also increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical plan" with the number of beds required for 25 years.
Many local residents and chiefs have maintained their cautious stance, and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare aims to invigorate the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.

When the eruption level was raised to 5 (evacuees), evacuation shelters were established in the forest and Nanae.
100,000 Students Call on Vancouver Climate Demo - Yahoo!News
About 100,000 people, mainly students who were empathetic to the 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest against climate change.
Climate Demo in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall to Canby Bridge and to the downtown library.
In front of the city hall of the meeting place, people with plastic cards started to gather for a few hours before the start.
After that, the number of participants continued to increase.
On the road, the police cooperated with the road regulations, and they watched over it for several hours.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, the city of Vancouver has held many events to consider global warming since last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike called "Fridays for Future" was held.
The students who took part in the school on this day complained to the adults that they wanted to protect the earth even if they had to rest.
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries - Yahoo!News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) released an amendment to the Epidemiological Guidelines to prevent the spread of ton cholera, an infectious disease of domestic animals.
The target area will be selected from nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefectures, which have been infected with pigs and wild boars.
Transfers such as live pigs and fertilized eggs are restricted within the region.
After public comments, we aim to complete the process in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and permitting extra-curricular distribution, the country is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the beginning of September last year, Japan's status as a clean country has been on hold.
In the draft amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "Vacation Recommended Area" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The prefectural government has created a vaccination program that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures that are recommended for vaccination include Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
The region shall review the situation when the guidelines are revised.
In principle, transfer of vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and vultures is limited to the region.
The meat and processed products are not covered by the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
We also try to prevent harmful rumors by calling for the safety of inoculated pigs.
The draft amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at the meeting of the Advisory Panel on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Epidemiological Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, we will carry out consultations and public comments to prefectural governments until October 7.
Unaffiliated Mr. Keisuke Honda and Man U have an open approach!
"Get an offer, don't need money" ( Football Channel ) - Yahoo!News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57
Last season, he left the Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and now he is a former member of the Japan National Team, Keisuke Honda.
[Video] Keisuke Honda actually played the game.
The truth of the sky is revealed
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on the 27th of July, said, "Please give us an offer, you don't need money, but you need to play with a great team or teammate."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, the world's most prestigious.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the best clubs in the Premier League?
The story of FOX Sport, which was released on the 24th, was published.
In an article titled "Five FWs that Manchester United could catch in the face of a crisis of injury," five non-affiliated players were picked up to win.
Among the players Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
Currently, United has suffered many injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marsal and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by director Aure Gunner Surshar, is forced to slip into a tough position with 2 wins and 22 defeats in the league.
The Australian media named Honda as a candidate for a new military force.
In the article, Honda's contract as a creative side player, rather than a striker, can fill a hole buried by Andreas Pereira.
"The 33-year-old Honda needs to be completely away from his pastime of managing Cambodia's national team and get a lot of attention."
Is Honda's approach true?
It's also worth noting that United will be moving forward for the next year's Tokyo Olympics.

Ikemura Hiroyo, a master of Naodra, doesn't need a tip-up for the first time?
Today's Caddy's Best Shot
A 1W shot is not always a tip-up.
There is also the so-called "director's" technique, which is to hit a ball on the ground when you want to make a distance with the second shot of par 5.
In recent years, 1W has a large head volume, so there is a risk of losing balls.
Ikemura Hiroyo is waiting for his first victory.
The 24-year-old, who is in his seventh year, has a height of 166 cm and is currently ranked 7th in the driving distance category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was fairway wood accuracy.
"I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W) in the early spring, so I thought I'd try a straight dora."
From the practice round, I put the ball on the grass in the area, and sometimes I shake 1W.
In the case where a big carry is required, Tie-up is often used, but both sides use a narrow hall to effectively use the DC Dora.
"It can be used in the hall where the eye line is laid down."
We recorded 270yd-280yd with carry on the ballistic instrument.
"That's why I don't need 3W.Cadhi can be more secure than 3W.
From June's Japan Tour Championship, Wood is only 1W in the caddie bag.
The second longest club is Loft's 17-degree UT.
The way of war, which the tour companions are surprised, is a pleasure to hear from the gallery.
The trick is to "wake a club at a level."
"I don't fly straight on the down blow or on the upper, I'm going to go right on the cut track, I'm originally doing a straight drag to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the time of the tie-up) and this practice also makes the attack angle (the angle of incidence of the club).
The ball is not caught and the risk of the slice is associated with the risk of "So the left side can be removed (do not bend to the left).
It's a professional skill that makes you feel unintentionally.

"Why do adults laugh and threaten their children?"
Greta Thunberg, Swedish environmental activist, gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While his speech has been garnering attention, there is an outrage of insulting Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonburi: "Why do adults laugh and threaten children?"
A political critic said about Greta on an American TV show, "He is mentally ill, he is used by parents and international leftists," and the TV station that hired him apologized.
In Japan, on the internet, there are a lot of reports on Greta's comments, such as "I'm sorry I'm using it."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teens and children?"
"I will come up with all possible lies and conspiracy theories."
Greta says, "Hey, it's started again, and as you realize, those who hate me are still active: they follow my look, my clothes, my attitude, and where I'm different from others, and they come up with an idea of what lies and conspiracy theories they can think of."
They pointed out that they did not want to deal with climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be misled.
I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teens and children.
That time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't spend your time paying attention to them anymore.
The world is beginning to awaken.
Changes are coming.
Even if adults like this change or don't like it.
Meet on the street on Friday!

Wed shot in Garcia
I was able to extend it to a certain extent in the first half, so I thought I could go to the second half with that momentum.
Did you see the win at Eagle No. 6 and Bardi No. 7?
Even after I hit Boggy 4th, I still had a par 5 left, so I had to take it back.
I was able to get a chance at No. 7 but I was disappointed that I couldn't reach it in the second half.
What did you get from this competition?
I didn't have a good shot recently, so I was able to keep my fairways tight.
The rough and opposite sides of the course were different, so I didn't have much experience.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (like a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all.
I didn't have a lot of other changes, but it was just a competition where there were few Japanese players in co-hosting.
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for the prize king, so I want to win another.
What is the method to prevent dementia from becoming a "dement"?
Interview/Text by Yo Watanabe
Drugs with dementia that are failing when major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become possible to remain extremely light and forgotten.
I interviewed Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of Kinki University Hospital.
Dementia does not disappear
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a possibility that everyone will get dementia after ageing.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance coverage in some countries, and it is not expected to have a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, with fewer deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents and fewer cancer deaths due to the tremendous progress in treating anticancer drugs, people can live longer.
This is why the number of dementia patients is increasing.
We need to create an environment where we can live comfortably in the community as a whole.
How to keep "forgotten"
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or is it difficult to get?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to get dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and keep it as "forgotten".
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be more prone to people.
Metabolic people tend to get dementia.
Dementia is regarded as a lifestyle-related disease.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
The presence or absence of economic power is also affected.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook.
Then, it becomes a diet with little vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased towards lipids and carbohydrates.
In time, it is poverty, but it becomes obese.
A similar situation can be found in Japan.
People who don't think about things or don't work tend to get dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things everyday.

Jaguar F-PACE, the first major improvement...
Jaguar's first crossover SUV, "F-PACE (F-PACE)" The camera captured the new prototype for the first time in South Europe.
F-PACE is the first 4-seater concept SUV released in 2013.
In 2014, a five-seater version was released, and in 2015 it officially debuted as F-PACE at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
The new model was launched in 2016 and this is the first face lift.
The prototype is covered with a thick camouflage, but a part of the new design can be seen.
The headlights are more compact and thin, and the side-air intakes are also modified to sporty ovals.
The grill is completely impersonated, but it is definitely redesigned.
At the rear end, you can see some of the revamped taillights with a long and narrow reverse light at the top.
