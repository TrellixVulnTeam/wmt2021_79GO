Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo! News
Violations against road traffic laws
The number of reports on accidents caused by malfunctions such as pedal mistakes is increasing, but it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, there were more than 1080 cases in the age of 24 years and 1032 cases over 75 years.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
are you going to take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to make mistakes due to accidental mistakes due to music and conversation etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the day's clothes, such as high heels, pamps, sandals and mulles, and drive as they are.
Although some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes, some people do not think that it may lead to danger at all, and many people drive without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations are operated. Article 70 of the Act stipulates that the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people.
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.For example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, there is a statement that the driver must not drive a vehicle (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, such as "slippers, suspensions, high heels, etc."
It is similar to the intention of each prefecture to consider driving as a violation of "a footwear that can prevent operation" even if it is not specified as a high heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first place the foot strap on the floor, place the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot tip to the right as the starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep the lid firmly fixed so that it does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the kato is grounded on the floor is small, and it always blurs out, and because the height of the heel has an angle on the entire foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is smaller and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull a high heel, and sometimes when it comes to a sudden brake, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be stepped, or the heel is removed in the time signature that the heel is pulled, and it can not be stepped inside the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back side of the pedal when stepping back from the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics, manufactured by Awaji Kawara, filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately ¥2 billion (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to repeated earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code: 530173983, capital of 92.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (Nishitenman 1-10-8, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, and Daichi Yoshida Law Office, telephone 06-665-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a Ibushi tile maker in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (now Minami-Awaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., but at the same time, the head office was relocated to its present location after changing its current business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and Juzen mainly used Ibushi tiles, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at a rate of 70 percent and Japanese-style tiles such as Ibushi tiles were 30%.
In the fiscal year ending December 2004, sales of approximately 3116 million yen were recorded.
He was known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand continued to grow due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, there was a continuous deficit with excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, which forced severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank tried to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, but there was no sign of recovery in business conditions, and gradually the financial position was imminent.
I couldn't help but abandoned the business and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

Especially in the second half of the game, the pitch form stabilized and continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball force.

I was able to gradually respond from early June.
"The more things we can do every day, the more we can do every day."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that I had set myself up one after another, the condition was greatly improved and the results were improved accordingly.
He was also confident that he "had been thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year."
Dalvish, who has the right to opt-out to cancel the contract after the end of this season, says, "I'm going to have to think about it, I'm going to talk to an agent and family," but "Basically, there's no dissatisfaction or fun about this team."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

is beauty and ugliness a piece of paper?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between the mysterious beauty and the shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
If you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between beauty and fear in your work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of these women who are opposite," but because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of the grudge that dwells in the grudge ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many of the works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes as "snake creatures" by the viewer, and people who feel "beautiful."
Some people say they like reptiles in the world, and others say they don't like it.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be the "snake" of the creatures in the back.
This creature has been worshipped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girls" and "Later Girls" in the 1965 series "Mama Hanakowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can it be said to be a "cool beauty" type ... I feel that it is similar to the beauty girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work, but it reminds me of snakes somewhere, such as deep sleep every 100 years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

why is it now?
Makoto Yuasa, chairman and social activist of the Kyoto NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely, and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "There was a need for a place to interact with people.
It is a place for multi-generational exchanges that elderly people also participate in, even if it is called "Tsuneko Shokudo."
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps to raise children and improve the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is, "Don't make a child to be born from there."
There are various places to offer meals every day from the 1st of May.
There are a wide variety of venues, from several to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere is getting ready for people who want to do it.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes you hear issues like a secure management system
Even though it is in Kyoto, " values change by interacting with many people" "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in the event of a disaster," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

The three models of the eight models are for women, and the update is based on the experience of the collection "The One Reimagined" (released in 2018) that redesigns sneakers from a female perspective, as Nike Women's Footwear Senior Creative Director Georgena James says, "Women are diverse and seek something different from others."
[Image] A total of eight new Air Force 1 models, including NBA collaboration and Goretex models, appeared.
The Air Force 1 NBA Pack, which collaborated with the NBA, appeared in two types: low-cut and high-cut.

The real culprit who attacked Saudi oil facilities drones "- Yahoo! News
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Aba Beer" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that have crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost, with a range of about 1000 km.
In order to fly low, it is also a strength that it is difficult to catch radar."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" announced a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran, led by President Rouhani, is behind the Fusi faction, and it is impossible for Iran to allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make crude oil in a situation where its own country cannot export crude oil," said Mr. Sugawara, an international political analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly stated the withdrawal of US troops from the Middle East, I would like to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections end, and Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever, and there is enough possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "substantial war" is imminent.
The reason why YouTuber became a full-time employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it to advertise their products, some companies have started a rare system called "YouTuber Adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
This is the direct marketing mix (DmMiX) of DmMiX, Inc., which is the main business of CRM (Customer Relationship Management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary adopted by YouTuber, talked about it.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now, YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the career rankings that elementary school students want to get in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, hiring young people who are chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber and trying to support them is YouTuber adoption.
There is an image that YouTuber is something that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to adopt them?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber is not earning as much as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we employ.
At first, we will support our activities by supporting the disadvantage of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"We hope South Korea will return to GSOMIA." - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary for the U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Mr. Napper, in response to an independent interview with the Nikkei newspaper at the Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 27, "I hope Korea will reconsider and come back to its decision to destroy Japan and Korea's comprehensive military information protection agreement (GSOMIA) which expires on November 23."
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, Japan, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
"Without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
"There is time to expire," he urged South Korea to return.
He also expressed the threat that the joint flight training conducted in July over the Sea of Japan was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging national interests in the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

i want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, macOS Catalina of the new OS will be released in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[Look at all images] Maybe the release date of macOS Catalina is October 4th?
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the letter "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4th.
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most on macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be superior with more completeness (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I would like to fully experience this next generation of macOS.

[The first half of the Bud Olympic race] world champion Kento Momota, and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, finished the training camp in early September, and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) which will open from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo starting from May to August, we will look forward to the men's singles for the midfield Games (September to December).
At the end of the World Championships, Budminton's Olympic Games began in May with four Super 500 and above.
In the first half of the game, the two players were Kento Momoda, who won two of the four races, and Shu Tensei (Cho Tienchen).
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei Indonesia OP (S1000) as well as the World Ranking Point which is directly connected to the Olympic Games.
In addition, Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
The tournament has been held since May, with the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/2013), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Fewer than the other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the wartime.
There is a need for good results in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
He was a strong Taiwanese ace in the series.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Shutensei, who also won the top Indonesia OP and Thai OP (S500), already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
It was an impression that Shutensei lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased so that he could continue his good grades firmly.
For Momota, the world's top ranking player, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphon and India's Cy Planis B.
Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone as a European.
Although Cantafon did not advance to the finals at the top of the competition, he had the power to advance to the top, such as entering the fourth place in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th) who has become able to rally against top players has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. has also taken a step out of India, where she has a great selection of singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will also be catching up in the future.
New rates for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as part of the revised Telecommunications Business Act of October.
However, it was generally stopped.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide SUGAWARA said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry was postponed, and the oligod status of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to become an easy-to-use pricing system by fair competition.
I want to ask for their efforts.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
Softbank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half.
However, both companies have a SIM lock that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes up to one-third of the terminals for subscribers of its own lines.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locking.
Companies must respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was due to the lack of infrastructure such as base stations.
It was expected to be an explosive in price reduction competition, so it was dressed in a shoulder strap.
It was probably the sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision of the price was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's going to be okay."
However, the government-made price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings.
Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on July 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage to special scams.
In the past three years, the maximum amount for depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs (automated cash depositors) is 500,000 yen, which can be made daily by cash card.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank lowered the Kihoku Shinkin Bank from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions and police officials, etc., and those involved in the Shinkin Bank "want to protect customers' important deposits in the best possible way."
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUKI who was transferred to Mutsu room including Yokozuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun
Following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki hoko), the Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers in the Itsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one sumo wrestler in the Tokoyama room to Mutsu.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Ozeki Kirishima), was born in the Izutsu room and was a brother of the late Izutsu Chikakata.
The Itsutsu Chikakata died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily detained in the same kagamiyama room, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu, at the time of autumn.
[ Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & fight Overseas ripple "following and cowardly play" in the face danger tackle of US players - Yahoo!News
FL Quill in the U.S. Raffplay, former England representative, "Not a Tackle."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was the last tournament in 20 countries to be held in the United States.
It became a black star, but Lafplay, played by FL John Quill in the second half, called a ripple.
He leaves with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players also complained that they could not be called "tuckle."
[Video] "An insulting and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
It was 29 minutes later when I arrived at 0-38.
In a deep battle, the English general Farrell was somewhat balanced when catching his ally pass.
It was Quill who went to Tackle.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head of the opponent is in contact with the head and the shape of the head is pierced.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
England protested against the obvious lack of legitimacy as an English player attempted to fly Quill.
Both players gathered at once and became an instant air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" of New Zealand, a strong rugby player, features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and was dropped" "It was almost a fight by both sides."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, a coward, not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S., which lacked a single match, managed to escape the final defeat in the 81st minute.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste behind.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced on September 26, the first time that 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, including Japan and the Red Cross, judged that their medical records were poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare verified the medical record of 14 public and public hospitals, and the four facilities were targeted: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of the City of straw, and Awara Hospital, the City of Sakai Three Kingdom Hospital, and the Oda Hospital in Echizen Town, the Wakasa Takahama Hospital.
⇒ Four hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to reduce medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to encourage the reorganization and integration of hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals nearby will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29-1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was high in Niigata (53,7%), Hokkaido (48,6%), Miyagi (47,5%), Yamaguchi (46,7%), and Okayama (43,3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals that can respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital should be considered to be abolished and some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals in Japan to 12.46 thousand beds (18 years).
Currently, there are many beds in the "Advanced Acute" and "Acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services for elderly people with high needs.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate the hospital, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical plan" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 parts of the country, with municipalities and medical officials discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komake eruption, road etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people from 20 organizations and residents attended the event.
The first event since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It was the first time in 18 years that residents participated in extensive training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in forests and Nanae Ryocho, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.

Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
On September 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Tonn cholera" (porks) that are not currently recognized.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have confirmed infection with pigs and wild boars.
Live pigs and fertilized eggs vaccinated are restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been temporarily suspended.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed, and will be approved by the province and allowed to use it by the governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will make a very clear decision on the situation.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, excreted objects, etc. is restricted to the region in principle.
As for meat and processed products, it is not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it practically accepts distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of the inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7, and new guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 distribution
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A. League, and now his former Japan national team, Keisuke Honda, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27 July, said, "Please give me an offer, but you don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of the crisis of the wounded," five unaffiliated players were picked up to be able to win.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshar, is forced to slip hard with 2 wins and 22 losses in the league and faces challenges in the quality of the front line.
It was Honda that the Australian media named him a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "It's not strictly a striker, but a creative side player, Honda's contract can fill the hole in Andreas Perilla."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," but it is pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian representative."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward because of the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on July 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a concentrated manner in the same area, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" started to show where to rent, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" can be seen on smartphones.
It is accessible from the site of Lake Hamana Tourism Area.
The free loan of Poketók, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April in response to the declaration of Hamamatsu, the largest inbound support city in Japan by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We want foreign customers to develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
right now, do you need to tie up the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not always tiring.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique, which is used to hold a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance with a second hit of par 5.
In recent years, 1W has a risk of ball scattering due to its large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in the professional seventh year, he is 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W), so I thought I would try Naodora."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball over the grass in the Ti Area, and you can also easily swing 1W.
In the case where Big Carrie is required, there is a lot of tie-ups, but both sides use Naodra effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in halls where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I'm also happy to hear the screams from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club horizontally."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a straight drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of ticking).
The ball is not caught, it is associated with the risk of slice, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that you can't think of.

Publication of the original manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa | Shizuoka Shimbun
A manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published in the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall.
The author Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA (1892-1927) published his essay "Shoku Bungeshi-mura Memorial Hall in Kita-ku, Tokyo" by himself in his last years of fighting literature with Junichiro Tanizaki.

Swedish environmental activist Greta Tonberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Political commentators stated on American television that Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing," and the television station that he used apologized.
In Japan, there are many messages on the Internet that comment on Greta's comments, such as "I feel sorry for being used" "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with lies and conspiracy theories as far as i can think.
"As you realize, those who dislike me are still active, as they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different, they come to think of as many lies and conspiracy theories as possible."
They pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seem to be distracting from the issue.
I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like the change, they don't like it.
i'll meet you on the street on friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, climate change strikes were held around the world, including New York.
Greta called on him to do it on Friday 27th.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not able to stretch well.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after I hit Boggy at #4, there was still a Per 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the Chip In Eagle came in #6.
It was a chance for Bardi to be caught in #7, but I regret not being able to reach it in the second half.
did you get it?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I was able to keep the key even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance changed, so I didn't have much experience so I studied quite well.
what is it?
It was possible to take a camera (smartphone, etc.).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for galleries.
There wasn't much else that changed, but it was just a competition where there were few Japanese players together, so I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you do not win more than one, you should not aim for the prize king, so I would like to win another.
What is the way to prevent dementia and keep things forgotten?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I talked to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a difference in the degree that everyone can become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepegil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation for a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the death of infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and the death of cancer has decreased due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting.
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is perceived as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are stored frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and sugars.
In the end, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing it, you can barely see the TV, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and who do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books everyday and think about things.
