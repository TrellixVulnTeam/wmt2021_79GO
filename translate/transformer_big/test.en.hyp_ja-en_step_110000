Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo!
Violations against road traffic laws
The number of reports on accidents caused by mishandling such as pedal mistakes is increasing, but it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 people aged 24 or younger were killed, exceeding 1032 people aged 75 or older.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet?
are you safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to a decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to mislead others, such as music and conversation, and to misstep due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals and mulles.
Although some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes, some people do not think about the possibility of becoming dangerous at all, and many people drive without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations are operated, and Article 70 of the Act stipulates that the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people.
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.For example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, the driver must not drive a vehicle (except light vehicles).
It is similar to the intention of each prefecture to consider driving as a violation of " footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if it is not specified as a high heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first put the foot on the floor to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as the starting point.
At this time, it is important to keep the lid firmly fixed so that it does not break regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the area where the kato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is small, because the height of the heel is angled throughout the foot, it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull a high heel, and sometimes when it comes to a sudden brake, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be stepped, or the high heel is removed in the time frame when the heel is pulled, and it can not be stepped inside the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back side of the pedal when stepping back from the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics, manufactured by "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to repeated earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code: 530173983, capital of 9.9.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishi-Tenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and another was Daichi Yoshida, a law firm and telephone number 06-665-6038.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a Ibushi tile maker in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, when Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., the head office was relocated to its present location after changing its current business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Juzen mainly used Ibushi-gawara, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at a rate of 70 percent and 30% of Japanese-style tiles such as Ibushi-gawara.
In the fiscal year ended December 2004, sales of approximately 3116 million yen were recorded.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand continued to grow due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent disaster such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a series of deficits due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make severe financial arrangements.
For this reason, the Bank tried to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of borrowings, but there was no sign of a recovery in business conditions, and gradually the financial position was imminent.
He was unable to support the project and gave up his business continuity.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished and Darbish pitcher (33) of Cubs, who finished the pitch this season, told the interview that "I have not done anything for two days, but I can't afford to watch baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
This season, he started 31 games, 6 wins, 8 losses, 3 98 defenses, 178 doubles and 229 strikeouts.
Especially in the second half of the game, the pitch form stabilized and continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball force.
"I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be such a feeling.In spring, I thought, "I'm going to end this way too," but when I came back from there, I felt that I could not believe that I could go to a better place."
I was able to gradually respond from early June.
"The more things we can do every day, the more we can do every day."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypothesis that he had established himself one after another, his condition improved dramatically and his grades improved accordingly.
He was also confident that he "had been thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year."
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I'm going to have to think about it, I'm going to talk to agents and families," but "Basically, there's no dissatisfaction or fun about this team."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

Even if the water pipe is not damaged, electric pumps that pump water from the water tank to each door will not be able to run due to power failure, and each door will be shut down.

is beauty and ugliness a piece of paper?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work? - Yahoo!
What are the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadow in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
If you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "feel."
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of the "Bijo Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of them in the opposite direction."
There is a keyword "snake" in many works of Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people in the world like reptiles, and some people don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "snake" creatures in the back.
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a spiritual creature since ancient times.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Hakowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ...I feel that it is the commonality of beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which has been serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work.

There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "There was a need for an exchange base in the area where people interact.

It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is, "Don't create children from there."
There are various places to offer meals every day from the 1st of May.
The venue is diverse from several people to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere is getting ready for people who want to do it.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.

Even though it is Kyoto, "The values change by interacting with many people" "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," Yuasa said.
It is like the light of hope for a closed society.

"The real culprit who attacked Saudi oil facilities" - Yahoo!
"The Iranian drone "Ababir" used in this bombing has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that have crashed.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, with a range of about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that it's hard to catch radar because it's flying low."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization, the "Fusi faction," issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that it is Iran, led by President Rouhani, that Iran is not allowed to produce crude oil in a situation where its own country cannot export crude oil, and if it continues to embargo crude oil against Iran, it is aimed at informing the international community that it will suffer accordingly."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock is coming back.
"Since Trump has publicly stated the withdrawal of US forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over, and Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever, and there is enough possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" is in imminent danger.
This is why YouTuber has become a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it to advertise their products, some companies have started a rare system called YouTuber adoption, which they employ as regular employees.
This is a direct marketing mix (DmMiX), which is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary that was actually adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
In the career rankings where elementary school students want to work in the future, the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "YouTuberr Adoption" to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
YouTuber has an image that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you consider hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber can't get the revenue they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who don't allow their family to recognize YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we employ.
At first, we will support our activities by supporting the demerit of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA." - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary for the U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in response to an independent interview by the Nikkei Shimbun at the Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 23, the Japan-Korea Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires, "I hope Korea will reconsider and return its decision to destroy it."
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, Korea, the United States, the United States, and the Republic of Korea to share missile launch information.
Korea announced in August that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that without GSOMIA, the crisis cannot be effectively addressed.
He strongly urged South Korea to return.
"It is essential for the United States and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, to collaborate in alliances," he said.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has pointed out that it will hurt the national interest of the United States.
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap."

"I forgot my hatred and returned with kindness and kindness.I felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he came to work, and completed the story "Meoto Oni" in which a friendly demon couple and a boy appear.
From June, he drew 10 scenes with warm watercolors by taking advantage of his job, and the materials of picture books were scattered.

[The first half of the Bud Olympic race] world champion Kento Momota, and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland in August, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) which will open from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic race that took place next year in Tokyo from May to August, we will look forward to the men's singles for the midfield race (September to December).
At the end of the World Championships, Budminton's Olympic Games began in May.
In the first half of the game, the two players were Kento Momota, who won two of the four races, and Shu Tensei (Cho Tien Cheng).
Momota won the World Championships and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
In addition, Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been held in four groups: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/2013), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Fewer than the other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the wartime.
There is a need for good results in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
He was a strong Taiwanese ace in the series.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Shutensei, who also won the top Indonesia OP and Thai OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
After the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by gaining high points in the first half.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, allowing him to continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking player, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphon and India's Cy Pranis B.
Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone as a European.
Although Cantafon did not advance to the final at the top of the competition, he was able to advance to the top of the competition, such as entering the fourth place in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against the top players seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranis B. has also taken a step out of India, where he has a great selection of singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will also be catching up in the future.
New rates for mobile phones Price reduction with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as a result of the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it almost stopped.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40 percent," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market has been postponed and the oligarchy of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to become an easy-to-use pricing system by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to increase the device to a maximum of half.
However, both companies have a SIM lock that cannot be used for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will use up to one-third of the device for subscribers on its own lines.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was due to the fact that the construction of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
It was expected to be an explosive for lower price competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision of the price was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, and I do not think that it will be good."
However, it is unlikely that the government-made price reduction will distort the market and promote sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings of users themselves.
Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, the Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on March 26 that they decided to reduce the limit of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage to special scams.
In the past three years, for depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank cut off Kihoku Shinkin Bank from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions and police officials, etc., and those involved in the Shinkin Bank "want to protect customers' important deposits in the best possible way."
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Yokozuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun
Following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki inverted hoko), the Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers in the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to Mutsu room.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was from the Izutsu room and was a brother and son of the late Izutsu Chikakata.
The Izutsu Chikakata died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same room of Kagamiyama, and future treatment was discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers, including Juryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
【Rugby World Cup】One-shot dropout and fight against "face-dangerous tackle" of U.S. players overseas ripple "following and cowardly play" - Yahoo!News
FL Quill in the U.S. is a rough play and former England representative, "Not a Tackle."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was the last tournament in 20 countries to be held in the United States.
It was a black star, but in the latter half of the episode, LF John Quill called it a ripple.
He leaves the scene with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by foreign media and video, and former English players also complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insult and a cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
The English general Farrell, who was deeply entrenched in the enemy's field, was somewhat in balance when catching his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head of the opponent is in contact with the head, and the shape is in which the head is pierced.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
An Englishman protested against the play, apparently lacking legitimacy, trying to fly Quill.
Both players gathered at once and became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play to boo.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby player, features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and dropped out."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked a single match, managed to escape the final defeat in the 81st minute.
However, Kyle's play left a bad aftertaste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced on September 26, the first time that 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka (Japanese Red Cross) decided that their medical records were poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the medical record of 14 public and public hospitals, and the four facilities of the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, Awara Hospital, Game Sakai City Three Kingdom Hospital, Game Takahama Hospital in Echizen Town, Wakasa.
⇒ Four hospitals to be reorganized "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals nearby will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was high in Niigata (53,7%), Hokkaido (48,6%), Miyagi (47,5%), Yamaguchi (46,7%), and Okayama (43,3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital should be considered to be abolished and some departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals to 11.91,000 in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a lack of rehabilitation for elderly people with high needs.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, municipalities and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
General training for disaster prevention including the assumption of Mt.Komake eruption, road etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people from 20 institutions, including roads and three towns, participated.
Since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August, it has been held for the first time.
It was the first time in 18 years that residents participated in a wide-area training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in forests and Nanae Ryocho, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.

The students who took part in the school on this day complained to the adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I take a break from what is important to school," and many adults who took part in the work off responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously thinking about learning."
Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
On September 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of the "Ton cholera" disease, which is not currently recognized.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been identified.
Live pigs and fertilized eggs vaccinated are restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution of meat, etc., it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been on hold for a while.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "premium for vaccination" based on the opinion of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and decide again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excreted objects, in principle, is restricted to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they practically accept distribution outside the country.
To prevent the spread of viruses, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to the prefecture will be conducted until October 7, and new guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 distribution
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and now his former Japan national team, Keisuke Honda, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27 September, said, "Please give us an offer, but we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could grab in the midst of a crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshar, is forced to slip out in the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and is facing challenges in the quality of the front line.
It was Honda that the Australian media named him a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Not strictly a striker, Honda's contract as a creative side player can fill the hole in Andreas Perilla."
"The 33-year-old Honda needs to be away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team and attract full attention," he said.
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward for the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On May 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machine "PokeTalk" at its member office.
It is the first time in Japan that the translator will be deployed in a concentrated manner in the same area, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" started to show where to rent, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" can be seen on smartphones.
It is accessible from the site of Lake Hamana Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, began in April with the initiative of nine organizations in the city to receive the declaration of "the largest inbound support city in Japan Hamamatsu."
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We want foreign customers to develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
now, you don't need to tie up the first hit, right?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not always tiring.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique when you want to make a distance by hitting the ball on the ground when you want to make a second hit of par 5.
The recent 1W involves the risk of ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year of professional life, he is 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
While he excelled in long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W), so I thought I would try Naodora."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball over the grass in the Ti Area, and you can easily swing 1W.
In the case where Big Carey is required, it is often used to tie up, but both sides are used to make effective use of direct drag in narrow halls.
"It can be used in holes where the eye line is pushed down."
In the ballistic instrument, carry recorded between 270 and 280 yd.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I'm also happy to hear a sense of admiration from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club horizontally."
"Even with a down blow, you can't fly straight even if you hit the upper.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a straight drag to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of ticking).
The ball does not catch and is associated with the risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that you can't think of.

His manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa was published for the first time.
A manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, first published in the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall.
The author Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) published his essay "Shoku Bunshimura Memorial Hall in Kita-ku, Tokyo" on his last years of fighting literature with Junichiro Tanizaki.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.
Although it was known that his essay was included in the whole collection, it was the first time that his manuscript was published publicly.
It is thought that he wrote it a few months before Akutagawa committed suicide, and the museum researcher, Takeshi Tanei, said, "I can see that Akutagawa, who was debilitating both mentally and physically, faced serious literary challenges with a tragic determination."
A total of 12 essays were published in the April 27 issue of Bungei Shunju.

While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet] Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Political commentators stated on American television that Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing," and the television station that used him apologized.
In Japan, there are many messages on the Internet that comment on Greta's comments, such as "I feel sorry for being used" "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with lies and conspiracy theories as far as i can think.
As you realize, those who hate me are still active; they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different; they come up with a possible lie and conspiracy theory."
They pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seem to be distracting from the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, climate change strikes were held in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta called on him to do it on Friday 27th.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not well and could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning it, the chip in Eagle came in No. 6.
It was a chance for Bardy to be caught in #7, but I regret not being able to reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I was able to keep up even in a narrow course.
It was a course where roughs and reverses were separated and the distance changed, so I didn't have much experience so I studied quite well.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (smartphone, etc.).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for galleries.
There were not many other changes, but since there were only few Japanese players in co-hosting the tournament, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for the prize king, so I want to win another.
What is the method to prevent dementia from becoming a "remember"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I talked to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation for a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the death of infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and the death of cancer has decreased due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
We need to create an environment in which we can live with peace of mind in the community as a whole.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting.
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and carbohydrates.
Eventually, poverty becomes obese, and what we do is we can barely see TV, and the body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books everyday and think about things.
