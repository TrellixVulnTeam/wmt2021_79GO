Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo!
Violations against Road Traffic Law
The number of reports on accidents caused by mishandling such as pedal treading is increasing, but it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 people aged 24 or younger were killed, surpassing 1032 people aged 75 or older.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
will you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to take steps due to accidental mistakes due to other things such as music and conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulles.
Some people say it is troublesome to change clothes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
The first is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations are operated. Article 70 of the Act stipulates that "the operation should not be operated to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committees, for example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, for example, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations, such as slippers, suspensions, high heels, etc."
It is similar to the intention of each prefecture to consider the operation as a violation of " footwear that can prevent operation" even if it is not specified as high heels.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first place the feet to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the feet to the right as the starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that it does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the kato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area where the kato is grounded on the pedal is always blur, and because the height of the heel is angled throughout the foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller, and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch a high heel, and sometimes when it comes to sudden braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be stepped, or the high heel is removed from the time signature when the heel is pulled, and it can not be stepped inside the pedal.
In addition, there is a case where the heel pulls to the back side of the pedal when stepping back from the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics, manufactured by Awaji Kawara, filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to the frequent earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code: 530173983, capital of 99.9 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), Daichi Yoshida Law Office, and telephone number 06-665-6038.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a Ibushi tile maker in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (now Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., but at the same time, the head office was relocated to its present location after the change to the current business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc. to become the current system, and Juzen mainly used Ibushi tiles, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at a rate of 70 percent and 30% of Japanese-style tiles such as Ibushi tiles.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand for tiled roofs has been sluggish, and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to approximately 1345 million yen.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank tried to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, but there was no sign of a recovery in business conditions, and gradually the financial position was imminent.
He was unable to support the project and gave up his business continuity.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

Dalbish summed up this season, "You can make a difference in your life" (East SpoWeb) - Yahoo!
[From St. Louis 27 (Japan time) ]
The possibility of playing in the playoffs disappeared, and Darbish pitcher (33) of Cubs, who finished the pitch this season, told the interview, "I haven't done anything for two days, but it's hard to see baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
This season, he started 31 games, 6 wins, 8 losses, 3 and 98 losses, but he threw 2/3 of 178 times and took 229.
Especially in the second half of the game, the throwing form stabilized and continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball force.
"I was 33 years old and I didn't think it would be such a feeling.In spring I thought, "I'm going to end this way too," but when I came back from there, I felt that I could not believe myself that I could go to a better place."
From around early June, I gradually got a response.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased, and the number of things we can do every day has increased."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that he had set himself up one after another, his condition improved dramatically, and his grades improved accordingly.
It also led to confidence that "it was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year."
Dalbish, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it now, I'll talk to my agents and my family."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

Nishida plays the head of the group that is strong but somehow unfavorable, and Nijima plays Himura, who is the No. 2 of the Tokimoto group that has always been choreographed by his parents.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I've been nervous all the time."
"Not only during the filming period, but also after the filming ended, the members gathered all the time and were a very united team as much as they were talking about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was just a drinking party that didn't reflect on at all," "It was a positive thing for the site that I could make such a time.I got better teamwork and got more motivation.I continued regularly after the end, and there are lots of good memories."
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Saijima confesses, "When I have a reflection meeting with this member, I drink too much, often I do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he is getting hurt," and "It looks like a silaf, but I was drunk?It's a really good hangover."
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to "make a series if reputation is good, I would like to do my best to make a series with your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to do our best to make a series."Nakao also regretted that Nishida was singing because he watched the movie.

is beauty and ugliness a piece of paper?
The image of "snake" overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!
What are the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadows in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I look at it with my hands, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of the work without Baizu again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of the women who are in the opposite direction."However, because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of the grudge that dwells in the grudge ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people say they like reptiles in the world, and others say they don't like it.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be the "snake" of the living creatures in the front and back.
Also, this creature has been worshipped as a spiritually powerful creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama is Kowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ...I feel that it is in common with the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which has been serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work, but it reminds me of snakes somewhere, such as deep sleep every 100 years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

Even though it is in Kyoto, " values change by interacting with many people" "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It is like the light of hope in a closed society.

The real culprit who attacked Saudi oil facilities by drone "- Yahoo!
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Ababir" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of U.S. forces that have crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
In order to fly low, it is also a strength that it is difficult to catch radar."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Housi, announced a statement of the crime.
"It is undoubtedly Iran, led by President Rouhani, that is behind the Fusi faction.Iran cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make crude oil in a situation where its own country cannot export crude oil, and if it continues to embargo crude oil against Iran, it is aimed at informing the international community of the pain associated with it."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over, and Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever, and there is enough possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "substantial war" is in imminent danger.
The reason why YouTuber became a full-time employee.
Listen to the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their own products, some companies have started a unique system called YouTuber adoption, which they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Inc. (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary that was actually adopted by YouTuber, talked about it.
i want to support young people who do their best with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (Kobayashi): Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "Youtuber adoption" to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
There is an image that YouTuber is something that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber is not able to make the profit as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we employ.
We will support our activities by supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber, which at first becomes unstable.

"Korea wishes to return to GSIMIA" U.S. Undersecretary of State (Asahi Shimbun) - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary for the U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Mr. Napper, in response to an independent interview with the Nikkei Shimbun at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the United States in Tokyo, said "I hope Korea will reconsider and come back to the decision to destroy Japan and Korea's comprehensive military information protection agreement (GSOMIA) which expires on November 23."
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, Korea, the United States, and the United States, and the ROK to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to crises."
"There is time to expire," he urged the return of Korea.
The joint flight training conducted by Churo in July over the Sea of Japan was also recognized as "the first time in history."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damaged the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation of macOS.

[The first half of the bad Olympics race] world champion Kento Momota, and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland in August, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) which will open from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic Games from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the midfield race (September to December).
The Badminton Olympic Games, which began in May, have digested the top four Super 500 and above events at the end of the World Championships.
In the first half of the game, the two players were Kento Momota, who won two of the four races, and Shu Tensei (Cho Tienchen) in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championships and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been held in four categories: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/2013), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Fewer than the other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the wartime.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
Taiwan's ACE is a strong match against Taiwan.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Shutensei, who also won the top Indonesia OP and Thai OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
After the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the tournament, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, allowing him to continue his good performance.
For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantafon did not advance to the finals at the top of the competition, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the fourth place in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who can rally against the top players seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranys B. has also taken a step away in India, where she has a great selection of singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will also be catching up in the future, so the Indian forces after the midfield battle must be careful.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released due to the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it almost stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga, Chief Cabinet Secretary, said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40 percent."
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market has been postponed and the oligarchy of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on terminal charges and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half the price.
However, both companies have a SIM lock that cannot be used for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes up to one-third of the terminal fee for subscribers of its own lines.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies must respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be an explosive in the price-cutting competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Perhaps it was the sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision of the price was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's going to be good."
However, the government-made price reduction does not seem to distort the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings of users themselves.
Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they decided to reduce the maximum amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank were reduced to Kihoku Shinkin Bank from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions and police officials, etc., and those in the Shinkin Bank "want to protect customers' important deposits in the best possible way."
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Yokozuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki Retrobo).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was from the Izutsu room and was a brother and son of the late Izutsu Chikakata.
The Izutsu Chikakata died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same room in Kagamiyama, where treatment was discussed in the future.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Juryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu, at the time of autumn.
[Rugby World Cup] One Outbreak & Struggle Overseas ripples "following and vulgar play" to "face risk tackle" of US players - Yahoo! News
FL Quill in the United States is a rough play, former England representative, "Not a Tackle."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) took place on the 26th, and the United States, the last in 20 countries, lost 7-45 to England.
It began as a black star, but in the second half, a rough play played by FL John Quill called a ripple.
A single exit is made by adding shoulder tackles to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene was released by overseas media as well as video, and former English players were bitterly accused of being "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "Following and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
In a deep enemy position, the English captain Farrell was somewhat in balance when catching his ally pass.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with the shape that pierces the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
England protested against the play, apparently lacking legitimacy, as it attempted to penetrate Quill.
Both players gathered at once and became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" of New Zealand, a strong rugby player, features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving" "It was almost a struggle by both sides."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S., which had only one match, managed to escape the final defeat in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left the poor aftertaste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced on September 26, the first time that 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, including Nikka, were identified as having poor medical records.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals.
⇒ Four hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to reduce medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that nearby hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53,7%), Hokkaido (48,6%), Miyagi (47,5%), Yamaguchi (46,7%), and Okayama (43,3%) were high.
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
In the case of a hospital subject, it is considered that some of the medical departments will be abolished and transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals to 11.91,000 in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high-altitude acute" and "acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 parts of the country, with local governments and medical officials discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and debates are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive drill for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people from 20 institutions, including roads and three towns, participated.
The first event since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It was the first time in 18 years that local residents participated in extensive training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in forests and Nanae Ryocho, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
On March 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of Ton cholera, a disease that has been transmitted to livestock, in order to prevent the infection.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been identified.
Live pigs and fertilized eggs that are vaccinated are restricted to the region, but distribution outside the meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments (an open call for opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been on hold for a while.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up the "Recommended Vaccination Area" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, are recommended for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and make decisions extremely once again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excreted objects, in principle, is restricted to the region.
With regard to meat and processed products, it is not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it virtually accepts distribution outside of the country.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of the inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 distribution
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A. League, and Keisuke Honda, a former member of the Japan National Team, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, made a public approach to a club, saying, "Please give me an offer, you don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of the ongoing crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshar, is forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faces challenges in the quality of the front line.
As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a potential new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole in Andreas Perilla."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian representative."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward for the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun at es
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on February 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu.
It is the first time in Japan that the translators will be deployed in a concentrated manner in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60% of the population.
The map app "Google Map" started to show where to rent, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" can be seen on the smartphone.
It can be accessed from the site of Lake Hamana Tourism Area.
The free loan of PoketTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "the largest inbound support city in Japan Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want foreign customers to develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
right now, do you need to tie up the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shot is not always tiring.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique, which is used to hold a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second ball of par 5.
Recent 1Ws involve the risk of ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
The 24th year of the professional 7th year is 166 cm in height and is currently 7th in the driving stance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled in long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In the spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W), so I thought I would try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped to the top of the grass in the Tie area, and sometimes a 1W swing is made.
In the case where Big Carey is required, a lot of tiUP is used, but both sides are used effectively in a narrow hall.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
In the ballistic instrument, carry recorded between 270 and 280 yd.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I'm also happy to hear the grievances from the gallery I saw.
The trick is "having a club (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, you can't fly straight even if you hit the upper.If it's a cut track, I'll go right.I used to do a straight drag to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of ticking).
The ball does not catch and is associated with the risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that you can't think of.

Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Political commentators stated on American television that Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing," and the television station that used him apologized.
In Japan, there are many messages on the Internet that comment on Greta's comments, such as "I feel sorry for being used" "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
come up with all the lies and conspiracy theories you can think about.
As you realize, those who hate me are still active; they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different; they come to think of as much lies and conspiracy theories as possible."
They pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seem to be distracting from the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, climate change strikes took place in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta called on him to do it on Friday 27th.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not well and could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the boggy at #4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip in Eagle came in #6.
It was a chance for Bardy to be caught in #7, but I regret not being able to reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I was able to keep it firmly even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the roughness and the reverse direction were separated and the distance changed.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for galleries.
Other than that, there were not many things that changed, but since there were only a few Japanese players in the competition jointly, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for the winning king, so I would like to win another.
What is the method to prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I talked to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a possibility that everyone will become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the death of infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer death has decreased due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the level of forgetting.
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgotten things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can only vaguely see TV, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day and think about things.
