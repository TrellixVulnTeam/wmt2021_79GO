Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo! News
Violations against road traffic laws
The number of reports on accidents caused by malfunctions such as pedal treads has been increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 people aged 24 or younger were killed, surpassing 1032 people aged 75 or older.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
will you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to mistake inadvertently due to other things such as music and conversation, and trampling due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, and mules, and drive them as they are.
Although some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes, some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people are driving casually.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
The first is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations are operated, and Article 70 of the Act stipulates that "the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committees, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, for example, "Do not drive vehicles (excluding light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations, such as slippers, suspensions, high heels, etc."
The purpose of each prefecture is similar to that of a violation of driving in footwear that may interfere with driving operation, even if it is not specified as a high heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first place the feet to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the feet to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that it does not blur.
However, in high heels, the area where the kato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area where the kato is grounded on the floor is always blurry, and because the height of the heel is angled throughout the foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller, making it difficult to adjust finely.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch a high heel, and in times of sudden braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal is not trampled, or the heel is removed in the time signature that the heel is pulled, and the heel is stuck in the back of the pedal and cannot be stepped.
In addition, there is a case where the heel is pulled to the back side of the pedal when stepping back from the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics, manufactured by Awaji Kawara, filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to repeated earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code:53173983, capital of 9.92 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and another was Daichi Yoshida (Yoshida Law Office, telephone 06-6365-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (now Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, when Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., the head office was moved to the present location after changing the business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc. to become the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used in the past, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70% and Ibushi-gawara were manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand was sluggish due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, which caused consumers to leave their roofs.
In terms of profits, in addition to a decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit with excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of borrowings, but there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and financial conditions gradually began to tighten.
I couldn't help but gave up on business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs disappeared, and Darbisch pitcher (33) of Cubs, who finished the pitch this season, told the interview, "I have not done anything for two days, but it is hard to see baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
This season, he started 31 games, 6 wins, 8 losses, 3 98 defenses, 178 doubles and 229 strikeouts.
Especially in the second half of the game, the throwing form stabilized and continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball force.
"I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be that kind of feeling.In spring I thought, "I'm going to end this way too," but I feel that I can't believe that I came back from there and went to a better place."
From around early June, I was able to gradually respond.
"The more things we can do every day, the more we can do every day."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypothesis that he had established himself one after another, his condition improved dramatically, and his grades improved accordingly.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt out of the contract after the end of this season, says, "I'm going to have to think about it, I'm going to talk to my agents and my family."

Nishida plays the leader of the group that is strong but somehow unfavorable, and Nimura, who is the number 2 of the Akimoto group that has always been choreographed by his parents, is played by Nishijima.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I've been nervous until today."
"Not only during the shooting period, but also after the shooting, the members gathered all the time, and it was a very united team as much as we talked about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was just a drinking party that didn't reflect on at all," and said, "It was a positive thing for the site to make such a time, team work became better and motivation increased.Even after the end, it continued regularly and there are lots of good memories."
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Saijima confesses, "When I have a reflection meeting with this member, I drank too much, often I do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how you're getting hurt," and "It looks like a silaf, but you're drunk?It's a really good hangover."
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to become a series if reputation is good, "I would like to do my best to make a series by borrowing your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to become a series," and Nakao said, "I would like to sing this time after watching the movie.

beauty and ugliness?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between the mysterious beauty and the expression of the shadow?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I look at it with my hands, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of the work without Baizu again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's works
In the preface of the Beauty Girl Collection, there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of the girls who are at the opposite end," but because of the contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of the grudge that dwells in the grudge ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many of the works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "snake" creatures in the back.
Also, this creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama wawai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ...I feel that it is the commonality of beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work, but in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, and a part with mysterious power are reminiscent of a snake somewhere.

There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "We needed a place where people interact with each other.
Even though it is called "Kyoko Shokudo," it is a place for multi-generational exchanges that elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of elderly people.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is, "Don't create children from there."
There are various places to offer meals every day from January 1 to March 1.
There are a wide variety of venues, from several people to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere is getting ready for people who want to do it.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.

"Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in a closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo!News
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Ababir" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the US military that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
It is also a strength that it is difficult to catch radar because it flies in low air." (Toru Yokota, a journalist)
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization, the Housi faction, issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that it is Iran, led by President Rouhani, that Iran, under circumstances where its own country cannot export crude oil, cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make a profit from crude oil, and if it continues to embargo crude oil against Iran, it is aimed at informing the international community of the pain associated with it."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's elections, we want to avoid any military intervention, and after that, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the grounds of hiding the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever, and there is sufficient possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "Operation Wars" are facing immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber became a full-time employee.
Listen to the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now extremely popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, some companies have started a rare system called YouTuber adoption, which they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Inc. (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary that was actually adopted by YouTuber, talked about it.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuberr Adoption" aims to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
There is an image that YouTuber is something that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber is not able to make any profit as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we employ.
We will support our activities by supporting the disadvantage of the profession of YouTuber, which at first becomes unstable.

"Korea wishes to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary of State (Asatsune Shimbun) - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in response to an independent interview by the Sankei Shimbun at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the United States in Tokyo, said on November 23, "We hope that Korea will reconsider and return its decision to destroy the military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA).
It is unusual for high-ranking U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, Japan, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
"Without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
He strongly urged Korea to return to Korea, saying, "There is time until revocation."
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan was "the first time in history."
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging national interests in the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap."

20 years in 30 days from the critical accident that alarmed the safety myth of the nuclear industry.
According to the report, although the international assessment scale (INES), which shows seriousness, accounted for about 90% of the items that were not evaluated or evaluated, it is necessary to raise awareness of safety in the face of lessons learned from the accident and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 11 years.
Mitsukazu Soda, who has completed the story and original drawings of his creative picture book, has been collecting donations for publication.
Koichi Soda (64), an artist in the Echizen City Regional Development Cooperation Team in Fukui Prefecture, started crowdfunding to raise donations online to publish creative picture books inspired by the legends of the prefecture in order to promote urban development using picture books.
Mr. Soda, who was originally from Hokkaido and started his activities as a member of the cooperative group from April this year, is eager to convey the hearts of the people of Fukui based on their deep faith through picture books.
[Donation is here] To convey Fukui's heart.
While Mr. Soda is active as an artist working on contemporary art based on mathematics, he has also been active as a member of the cooperative team since the return of the calendar.
After working on the town development of Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi, he joined Echizen City in April this year.
In the same city that produced Satoko KAKO and Chihiro IWASAKI, we aim to create a town using picture books.
Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion around me for the first time."
What attracted attention was the legend of the city of Awara, 'The face of the demon of the bride'.
It is a story that a gentle married woman continues to chant Nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) to help her mother without worrying about being surprised by her face.
"I forgot my hatred and returned with kindness and kindness, and I felt the origin of the sincerity and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived, and completed the story "Meoto Oni" with a loving couple and a boy.
From June, he drew 10 scenes with warm watercolors using his main job, and the materials of picture books were scattered.
In addition, the cover of picture books is planned to be made with washi using Echizen Washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
It connects to the opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the touch of washi (Japanese paper).
The goal of the donation amount is 850,000 yen for 600 copies.
The deadline is 25 October.
"Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud throughout Japan.
I want to convey the true kindness and compassion that has been handed down to children through picture books."
It is one of the projects that Fukui Prefecture has certified 11 projects for regional revitalization, which are challenged by local cooperatives and businesses in the prefecture, and is supported by using Furusato Tax.
The Bank of Japan (Fukui Shimbun) cooperates with management support.

When Crop finally asked a more personal question, he concluded, "When I blessed the Bundesliga championship, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was, this time I didn't happen, because I'm a man suffering from the obsession of self-management, I don't like to get drunk.I remember everything.If I put everyone in front of me, I might be able to tell everyone from the bus."

The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[Look at all images] The release date of macOS Catalina may be October 4th.
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the letter "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4.
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most on macOS Catalina.
This is a feature that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be superior with more completeness (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation macOS.
Sakura Ebi in the Growth Process PT in Shizuoka City and 290 meters deep | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
Sakura Ebi, born this year, was successfully photographed in the deep sea of Suruga Bay.
The Yuhi Sakura Ebi Project, a project of the Ocean Industry Cluster Council by industry, academia, and government officials in Shizuoka City, succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp, which is thought to have been born during the spawning season this spring and summer, at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the concerned parties want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photograph was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1 to 5 km off the coast of Kamahara district, Shimizu Ward, the city.
A total of 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.
In the daytime, the traditional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea form a certain group at the bottom of the sea was re-established.
The adult body is about 40 mm long, and the individual shown is about 23 mm long.
They identified the spawning season by matching the seasonal data of freshly caught sakura shrimp.

[The first half of the bad Olympics race] world champion Kento Momoda, and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland in August, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic Games from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles in the middle of the Games (September to December).
At the end of the World Championships, the Badminton Olympic Games, which began in May, digested the top four Super 500 and above.
In the first half of the competition, the two players were Kento Momoda, who won two of the four competitions, and Shu Tensei (Cho Tien Cheng) in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championships and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
In addition, Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been held in four categories: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/2013), the Japan OP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Fewer than the other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was the only World Championships in the world, fatigue would not be greater than the wartime.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
Taiwanese aces are strong against each other.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the top Indonesia OP and Thai OP (S500), already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical personality and does not suffer from battle.
After the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to earn high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, allowing him to continue his good performance firmly.
For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphon did not advance to the finals at the top of the competition, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the fourth place in the second round of this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against the top players has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Planis B. has also taken a step forward in India, where he has a great selection of singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will also be catching up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was announced as part of the revised Telecommunications Business Act of October.
However, it almost stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga, Chief Cabinet Secretary, said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40%."
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market has been postponed, and the oligarchy of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on terminal charges and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device a maximum of half the price.
However, both companies have a SIM lock that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one-third of the terminal cost for subscribers of its own lines.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected to be an explosive for lower price competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
It may have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
The price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think the competition will start in the future, and I do not think that it will be good."
However, the government-made price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by users themselves.
Cache Card for 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they decided to reduce the maximum amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank were lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions and police officials, and ATMs are issued.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was transferred to Mutsu room including Yokozuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
Following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki inverted hoko), the Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Itsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was from the Izutsu room and was a brother and son of the late Izutsu Chikakata.
The Izutsu Chikakata died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same Kagamiyama room, and the treatment was discussed in the future.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Toryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] Outbreak & Struggle Overseas ripples "following and vulgar play" in the "face risk tackle" of US players - Yahoo! News
FL Quill in the United States is a rough play, former England representative, "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was the last tournament in 20 countries to be played in the United States.
In the latter half of the play, Lafplay, played by FL John Quill, called the ripple.
He leaves the scene with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by overseas media and video, and former English players also complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insult and a cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply entrenched in the enemy's ranks, was somewhat in balance when catching his ally pass.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body instead of the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and the head of the opponent are in contact with the shape that pierces the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against Quill in a play that was obviously lacking legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and was dropped" "It was almost a struggle by both sides."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S., which lacked a single match, managed to escape the final defeat in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Quill's play left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals in Japan and public hospitals such as Japan and the Red Cross, which determined that "the medical record is poor."
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and the four facilities of the National Hospital Organization of the City of straw, Awara Hospital, the City of Sakai Three Kingdom Hospital, the Oda Hospital in Echizen Town, and the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital in the town of Kitahama were targeted.
⇒ Four hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to reduce medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals close to them will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%) were higher.
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
For hospitals that are eligible for treatment, consider abolishing or transferring some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1,246 thousand beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high-altitude acute" and "acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for elderly people.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, municipalities and medical officials have been consulted, many local residents and chiefs have maintained their cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive drill for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road, etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people attended, including staff and residents of 20 institutions, including roads and three towns.
The first event since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It has been 18 years since the local population participated in extensive training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in forests and Nanae Ryocho, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.

About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change measures.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall across the Canby Bridge to the downtown library.

Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries - Yahoo!
On March 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of Ton cholera, a disease that has been transmitted to livestock, in order to prevent the spread of the disease.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs that are vaccinated is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (an open call for opinions), we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "prevention zone" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines have been revised, the region will review the situation and decide again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excreted objects, in principle, is restricted to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they effectively tolerate distribution outside the region.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of the inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, a public approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 distribution
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and now his former Japan national team, MF Honda Keisuke, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th September, said, "Please give us an offer, but we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of the ongoing crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshar, is forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faces challenges in the quality of the front line.
As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a potential new force for Teco.
In the article, it is analyzed that Honda's contract as a creative side player, rather than a striker, can fill the hole in Andreas Perilla.
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," but it is also pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward because of the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is the first time in Japan that the translators will be deployed intensively in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" has also started to show where to rent it.
It is accessible from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Poketók, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city in response to the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu."
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want foreign customers to develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
now, ikemura kanyo, who is a famous person of Naodora, does not need to tie up the first shot?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not necessarily tying up.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique, which is used to hold a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of the par 5.
The recent 1W involves the risk of ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, he is 166 cm in height and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In the spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't want to shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I would try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tirea, and sometimes a 1W swing is made.
In the case where Big Carey is required, it uses a lot of tie-ups, but both sides use Naodra effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded between 270 and 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17° UT.
I'm also happy to hear the exclamation from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I was originally doing a straight drag to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of ticking).
The ball does not catch and is associated with the risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that you can't think of.

The only way to move is skateboarding!
I have been hooked since my friend invited me to slide.
I'm still a beginner, but it feels good to run through the asphalt with push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because it can be sold free with smartphones, wallets and luggage.
You can feel the wind directly and feel good with the shorts.
Of course, it is light with Converse skateboard shoes.
Fashion and culture around skateboarding are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram carefully!

Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech has attracted attention, it has been reported to insult Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Political commentators stated on American television that Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing," and the television station that used him apologized.
In Japan, there are many messages on the Internet that comment on Greta's comments, such as "I feel sorry for being used" "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with lies and conspiracy theories as far as i can think.
As you realize, those who hate me are as active as ever: they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different, and they come to think of as much lies and conspiracy theories as possible."
He pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but seem to be distracting from the issue of the story.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, climate change strikes took place in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta also called on Friday, 27th.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable that the seater was not able to stretch well.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
After hitting Boggy on #4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning it, the chip-in-eagle came on #6.
The 7th was also a chance for Bardy, but it was regrettable that he couldn't reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Since I haven't been in good condition recently, I was glad that I was able to keep it firmly even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance changed.
what is it?
It was possible to shoot a camera (smartphone, etc.).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for galleries.
There were not many other things that changed, but there were only a few Japanese players in the competition jointly, so I went to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for the winning king, so I would like to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia from becoming "forgetting something"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with their research and development challenges.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I talked to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepegil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation for a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and the number of cancer deaths has decreased due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgetting things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can only vaguely see TV, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day and think about things.
