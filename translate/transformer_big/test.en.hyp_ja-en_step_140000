Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo!
Violations against road traffic laws
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading is increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, there were more than 1080 cases aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases aged 75 or older.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to be due to a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to mistake inadvertently due to other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on their day's clothing, such as high heels, pamps, sandals and mules, and they drive as they are.
Some people say it is troublesome to change clothes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic law.
The first is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations are operated. Article 70 of the Act stipulates that "the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.For example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, there is a statement that drivers must not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations.
In each prefecture, even if it is not specified as a high heel, it is the same purpose to consider driving as a violation of " footwear that may interfere with driving operation."
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first put the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that it does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs out, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal becomes smaller and it is difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be firmly trampled.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch a high heel, and sometimes when the heel is pulled and the pedal is not trampled, or when the heel is pulled, the high heel is removed and stuck inside the pedal.
In addition, there is a case where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping back from the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., which manufactures "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to the frequent earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code:53173983, capital of 9.92 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishi-Tenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and another was Daichi Yoshida.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., but at the same time, the head office was moved to its present location after changing its present name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and Ibushi tiles were mainly used in the past, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70% and Ibushi tiles were manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand continued to grow due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
In terms of profits, in addition to a decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit with excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of borrowings, but there was no sign of a recovery in business conditions, and financial conditions gradually began to tighten.
I couldn't help but abandoned the business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

This season, he started 31 games, 6 wins, 8 losses, 3 98 defenses, 178 doubles and 229 strikeouts.
Especially in the latter half of the game, the throwing form stabilized and continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball force.

I was able to gradually respond from around early June.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased, and the number of things we can do every day has increased."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that he had set himself up one after another, his condition improved significantly, and his grades improved accordingly.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year.

beauty and ugliness?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmix) - Yahoo!
Is the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadow in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I look at it in my hand, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of the work without painting again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
5 beautiful girls of the work without Baizu
In the preface of the "Bijo Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of these women who are at the opposite end."However, because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of resentment that dwells in grudge ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "snakes" of the living things in the front and back.
This creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama wawai!."
The market is for beautiful women with shadows.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ...I feel that it is the commonality of beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu works, but in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, and a part with mysterious power are reminiscent of "snake."

Eight new models of "Air Force 1" including NBA collaboration and models equipped with "Goretex" (WWD JAPAN.com)
Nike will release eight new models of Air Force 1 (AIR FORCE 1) that have been popular as sneakers representing the brand since its launch in October 1982.
Three of the eight models are for women, and as Nike Women's Footwear Senior Creative Director Georgena James says, "Women are diverse and seek unique things that are different from others," an update is added based on her experience in the collection "The One Reimagined" (released in 2018) that redesigns sneakers from a female perspective.
[Image] Eight new models of "Air Force 1" including NBA collaboration and models equipped with "Goretex" appeared at once
The Air Force 1 NBA Pack, which collaborated with the NBA, appeared in two types: low-cut and high-cut.
The low-cut is based on NBA red, yellow, black, and navy, and the high-cut is available in three teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers.
The NBA logo is attached to the heel and shoetan, and satin fabric is used behind the upper, making the swish the first by-color design.
The price was 12,200 yen including tax, and it was released on October 1.
The "Air Force 1 Swish Pack" is designed everywhere with the letters and logos of Swish as it is.
The shoe tongue part, which is supposed to have a brand logo originally, is also changed to the character of the special "SWOOSH."
The "Air Force 1 Shadow" is characterized by the double shadow of each detail, including the side wash, inspired by shadows.

a drone attack on a Saudi oil facility.
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Ababir" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the US military that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
In order to fly low, it is also a strength that it is difficult to get caught by radar."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" announced a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Houthi faction, under President Rouhani's leadership.Iran cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under circumstances where its own country cannot export crude oil, and if it continues to embargo crude oil against Iran, it is aimed at informing the international community that pain will accompany it."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock comes again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of US troops from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's elections, we want to avoid any military intervention, and as we know it, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the United States will not be able to endure it forever, and there is sufficient possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "Operational War" is in imminent danger.
The reason YouTuber became a full-time employee.
Listen to the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their own products, some companies have started a rare system called "YouTuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Inc. (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary that was actually adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who do their best with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): YouTuber is now a longing for many young people.
It is also ranked in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to get in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuberr Adoption" is to adopt and support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
YouTuber has an image that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber is not able to make a profit as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for creating salary and content for creators who have adopted it.
We will support our activities by supporting the disadvantage of the profession of YouTuber, which at first becomes unstable.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA." - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for the United States, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Korea and Japan, responded to a single interview by the Sankei Shimbun at the official residence of the U.S. Ambassador in Tokyo on November 27.
It is unusual for a high-ranking U.S. official to refer to a reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, Korea, the United States, and the United States, and the Republic of Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
"Without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
"There is time to expire," he strongly urged the return of Korea.
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted in July over the Sea of Japan was the first time in history.
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damaged the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap."

This is a function that treats iPad as a subdisplay of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be superior with more perfection (or response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation macOS.

[The first half of the bad Olympic race] world champion Kento Momoda and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the Badminton Big Event in August and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic Games from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the mid-game (September to December).
The Badminton Olympic Games, which began in May, digested four of the top athletes (super500 or more) at the end of the World Championships.
Two of them, Kento Momoda, who won two of the four races, and Shu Tensei (Cho Tienchen) in Taiwan, were successful in the first half.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May / China), Indonesia OP (July / results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July), and World Championships (August).
Fewer than the other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than during wartime.
There is a need for good results in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical personality and does not suffer from battle.
After the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, allowing him to continue his good performance.
For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thai young Ace Cantafon and Indian Cy Planis B.
Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone as a European.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the final at the top level, he has the power to advance to the top level, such as entering the fourth place in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th) who was able to rally against the top players has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Planis B. has also taken a step forward in India, where he has a great selection of singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will be driving up in the future, so the Indian forces after the midfield battle need to be careful.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as a result of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it almost stopped.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40%," and although expectations for price reduction were high, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry was postponed, and the oligarchy of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The revised Act prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device a maximum of half the price.
However, both companies have a SIM lock that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one-third of the terminal cost for subscribers of its own lines.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
The company needs to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be a detonator of price reduction competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
It may have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
The price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I do not think that it will be okay."
However, the government-made price reduction does not seem to distort the market and promote sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by themselves.
Cache Card for 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they decided to reduce their withdrawal limit by cash card to prevent damage from special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank were lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions, police officials, etc. and sent out at ATMs.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Yokozuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki inverted hoko).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was from the Izutsu room and was a brother and son of the late Izutsu Chikakata.
The Izutsu Chikakata died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the Kagamiyama room of the same gate, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One Outbreak & Struggle Overseas ripples on the "face-dangerous tackle" of U.S. players "a insult and cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
FL Quill in the United States is a rough play, former England representative, "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was held on the 26th, and the United States, the last to appear in 20 countries, lost 7-45 to England.
It was originally a black star, but later a rough play performed by FL John Quill called a ripple.
He leaves with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players also complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insult and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply entrenched in the enemy's field, was somewhat in balance when catching his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he caused the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head of the opponent is in contact with the head and the shape that pierces the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against Quill in a play that was obviously lacking legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once and became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and dropped out."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, a coward, not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S., which had only one match, managed to escape the final loss in the 81st minute.
However, Kyle's play left a bad aftertaste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced on September 26, 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Japan Red Cross for the first time that they judged that their medical records were poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare examined the treatment achievements of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of straw City, and Awara Hospital, and the Oda Hospital in Echizen Town, respectively.
⇒ Four hospitals to be reorganized "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals nearby will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital will be considered to be abolished and some departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1,246 thousand beds (18 years).
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are incurred, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for elderly people.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
General training for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road etc. Wide area with participation of residents, 18 years in the first time (video): Hokkaido Shimbun
A comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held on September 27 in the forest, Nanae and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people attended, including staff and residents of 20 institutions including roads and three towns.
It has been held for the first time since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.

100,000 students appeal to Vancouver's climate demonstration against school holidays and global warming - Yahoo!
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall to the Canby Bridge and downtown library.
The number of people with placards began to gather in front of the city hall of the meeting place a few hours before the start, and at 13 o'clock at the start time was enough to fill the road of the city hall front block.
More than 100,000 people attended the event.
On the road along the way, the police also cooperated with the road regulations and watched over all people for hours until they finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York City, Vancouver has held many events to think about global warming since the last weekend.
On the last day, the school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school on this day complained to the adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I rest the important thing of the school," and many adults who took part in the work off responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously thinking about learning."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
On March 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of the "Ton cholera" disease, which is not currently recognized.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been identified.
Live pigs and fertilized eggs vaccinated are restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (the public offering of opinions), we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been temporarily suspended.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "prevention area" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, how to proceed, etc.
Seven other prefectures that are recommended for vaccination are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the guidelines have been revised, the region will review the situation and make a decisive decision.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excreted objects is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they practically accept distribution outside the country.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, we will conduct opinion inquiries and public comments to prefectures until October 7 and implement new quarantine guidelines.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and now his unaffiliated former Japan national team, MF Honda Keisuke, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, said, "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of the ongoing crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faces challenges in the quality of the front line.
As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a potential new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole in Andreas Pereira."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," but it is also pointed out that " 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward for the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on February 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu.
It is the first time in Japan that the translators are deployed in a concentrated manner in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" also started to show where to rent it, so that you can see the location of "stores for foreign languages" on your smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Pokettalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu."
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I would like you to develop new foreign customers while the business environment is severe."
right now, you don't need to tie up your first hit.
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shot is not always tiring.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique, which is used to hit a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second ball of par 5.
The recent 1W involves the risk of ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kansei is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in the professional seventh year, he is 166 cm in height and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W), so I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tiere, and sometimes a 1W is shaken.
In the case where big carry is required, a lot of tiUP is used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degrees UT.
The tactics that surprise the tour companions are also pleasant to hear the exclamation from the gallery they saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I was originally doing a straight drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
The ball does not catch and is associated with the risk of slice, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that you can't think of.

I have been hooked since my friend invited me to slide.
I'm still a beginner, but it feels good to run through the asphalt with push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because it can be hands-free with smartphones, wallets and luggage.
You can feel the wind directly and feel good with the shorts.
Of course, it is light with Consverse skateboard shoes.
Fashion and culture around skateboards are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram carefully!

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the seater was not good enough to stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip in eagle came at #6.
But I was disappointed that I couldn't reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I could keep it firmly even in a narrow course.
It was a course where roughs and backs were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference?
(Smartphones, etc.) It was possible to shoot a camera.
I didn't care at all, but the gallery people were filming videos.
There were not many other things that changed, but there were only a few Japanese players in the competition jointly, so I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you shouldn't aim for the winning king, so I would like to win another.
How do you prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be kept to the extent of extreme mildness and forgetting.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I talked to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepegil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation for a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and cancer deaths are decreasing due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to become dementia.
Dementia is perceived as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, poverty becomes obese, and what we do is only vaguely see TV, and the physical disability becomes.
A similar situation can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books from day to day.
