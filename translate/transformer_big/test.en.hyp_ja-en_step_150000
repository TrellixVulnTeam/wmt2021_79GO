Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo! News
Violations against road traffic laws
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading is increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, the number of accidents involving pedal treading errors by age is 1080, more often than 24 years old.
There are never many mistakes made by the elderly, and it is important for young people to call attention the same way.
do you want to take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to mistake inadvertently due to other things such as music and conversation, and trampling due to clothes etc.
In particular, some women choose different shoes depending on their day's clothing, such as high heels, pumps, sandals and mules, and drive them as they are.
Some people say it is troublesome to change clothes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Law.
The first is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations. Article 70 of the Act stipulates that "the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committees, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations, such as "slippers, hanging, high heels."
Even if it is not specified as a high heel, the purpose of each prefecture is to consider driving as a violation of " footwear that may hinder operation."
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first put the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal and tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that it does not blur.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs out, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is smaller and it is difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be firmly trampled.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get a high heel shape, and sometimes when it comes to sudden braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be stepped, or the heel is removed in the time signature that the heel is pulled, and it can not be stepped by pinching the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is stopped.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics, manufactured by Awaji Kawara, filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to the frequent disaster.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code: 530173983, capital of 91.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, 6-665-6038 by telephone).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.
At first, in the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd., he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (now Minamiawaji City).
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., but at the same time, the head office was moved to the present location after changing the business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc. to become the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70% and Ibushi-gawara was manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand continued to grow due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
On the profit side, in addition to a decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit with excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to carry out severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of borrowings, but there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and the funding situation gradually became tight.
I couldn't help but abandoned the business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

This film is a painful story in which Yakuza and the head of the Tokimoto Group, who are not interested in contributing to society, undertake the reconstruction of high school on the verge of bankruptcy, and solve various difficulties with Giri's feelings.
Nishida plays the head of the group, who is strong but does not hate somewhere, and Nimura, who is the number 2 of the main group of AKI, who has always been choreographed by his parents, is played by Nishijima.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I've been nervous for a long time."
"Not only during the shooting period, but also after the shooting, the members gathered all the time, and it was a very united team that talked about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was just a drinking party called a review meeting that didn't reflect on at all" , "It was a plus for the scene that I could make such a time, teamwork got better, motivation got better, it continued regularly after the end, there are lots of good memories."
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Saijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drink too much, often I do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he is being beaten," and "It looks like a silaf, but I was drunk?It's a really good hangover," and attracted the laughter of the venue.
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to "make a series if reputation is good, I would like to do my best to make a series with your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to make a series," Nakao said, "I'm sorry that Nishida was singing when I watched the movie.

The Association Presidents' Association also approved the formal addition of the fish species to the target fish species for test operations in the areas of Casago, Sakura Mas and Murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture where shipping restrictions were lifted.

beauty and ugliness?
The image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadow in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I look at it with my hands, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Baizu's work again.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of the Beauty Girl Collection, there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of the girls who are at the opposite end," but because of the contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of resentment that dwells in vengeance ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "snakes" of living things in the back.
Also, this creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga kowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu works, but in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, and the part with mysterious power somehow reminds me of "the snake."

There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "There was a need for an exchange base in the area where people interact.
Even if it is called "Kyodo Shokudo," it is a "place for multi-generational exchange" where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that you don't have to have children from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day from January 1.

It is like the light of hope in a closed society.

"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Ababir" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the US military that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to catch radar because it flies low." (Toru Yokota, a news photographer)
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization, the Housi faction, issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran, under President Rouhani's leadership, is behind the Houthi faction, and it is unacceptable that Saudi Arabia, which is hostile to Iran, is making crude oil in a situation where its own country is unable to export crude oil, is aiming to inform the international community if oil embargo measures continue to take place against Iran, accompanied by pain."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's elections, we want to avoid any military intervention, knowing that Iran will continue to bomb drones in hiding, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever, and there is sufficient possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "Operational War" is in imminent danger.
The reason why YouTuber, a super personality, became a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri.) 8:47 distribution
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, some companies have started a unique system called YouTuber adoption, which they employ as regular employees.
This is the direct marketing mix (DmMiX) of DmMiX, Inc., which is the main business of corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary of YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter, Kobayashi): Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people have longed for.
It is also ranked in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to get in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuberr adoption" aims to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
There is an image that YouTuber is something that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber can't get the revenue that they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for creating salary and content for the creators we hired.
At first, we will support the demerits of the profession called YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"We hope South Korea will return to GSOMIA." - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Korea and Japan, in response to an independent interview by the Sankei Shimbun at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the United States in Tokyo, said on November 27 that the Japan-Korea Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA) that expires on November 23, "I hope Korea will reconsider its decision to destroy it and return."
It is unusual for high-ranking U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
"There is time until revocation," he strongly urged the return of Korea.
As for the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan, it was the first time in history to recognize the threat.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging national interests in the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap."

i want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th.
[Look at all images] The release date of macOS Catalina may be October 4th.
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the character "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4th.
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better with more perfection (or response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation of macOS.

The adult body is about 40 mm long, and the individual shown is about 23 mm long.
The spawning period was identified by matching the seasonal data of freshly caught sakura shrimp.
Detailed analysis is requested by Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Technical College, which comprise the team.
Keisuke Mizuno, Project Leader, said, "I want to capture the living figure of individuals in the growth process, including fry."

(Yasutoshi NAKAMURA)
[The first half of the bad Olympic race] world champion Kento Momota and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the Badminton Big Event in August and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic Games from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympic Games, we will look forward to the men's singles for the midfield Games (September to December).
The Badminton Olympic Games, which began in May, digested four of the top athletes (super500 or higher) at the end of the World Championships.
In the first half of the competition, the two players were Kento Momota, who won two of the four competitions, and Shu Tensei (Cho Tien Cheng) in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been contested by four groups: the Sudirman Cup (May / China), the Indonesia OP (July / results are 16 strong), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Fewer than the other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than during wartime.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
Taiwan's aces are strong against each other.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the top Indonesia OP and Thai OP (S500), already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a very strong player and does not suffer from a series of battles.
After the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to earn high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but by the beginning of this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and it was able to maintain good results.
For Momota, who is the number one in the world ranking, it seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphon did not advance to the finals at the top of the competition, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the fourth place in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th) who is now able to rally against the top players has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Planis B. has also taken a step forward in India, where singles have good players.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who are late due to injury, will be catching up in the future, so the Indian forces after the midfield battle need to be careful.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as a result of the revised Telecommunications Business Act of October.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40%," and although expectations for price reduction were high, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market has been postponed and the oligarchy of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts for terminal and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device a maximum of half the price.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will use up to one third of the terminal cost for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten was due to the fact that the development of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
It was expected to be an explosive for lower price competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
It may have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision of the fee triggered the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, and I do not think that it will be good."
However, the government-made price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by themselves.
Cash Card for 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, the Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on March 26 that they decided to reduce their withdrawal limit using cash cards to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank were lowered, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank was lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which financial institutions, police officials, etc. fake cash cards and PINs, and are issued at ATMs.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki Retrobo).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was from the Izutsu room and was a brother and son of the late Izutsu Chikakata.
On the 16th, Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same kagamiyama room, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One Outbreak & Fighting Overseas ripples in "face-dangerous tackle" of U.S. players "a insult and cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
The American FL Quill was a rough play, and the former England national "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was held on the 26th, and the United States, the last in 20 countries, lost 7-45 to England.
It began as a black star, but Lafplay, played by FL John Quill in the latter half, called the ripple.
He leaves the scene with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was also released by overseas media with video, and former English players were bitterly accused of being "an insult and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insult and a cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply entrenched in the enemy's field, was somewhat out of balance when catching his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent come into contact, and it is shaped like a head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once and became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving" "It was almost a struggle by both sides."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Monha.
"It's an insult, a coward, not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked a single player in the game, managed to escape the final defeat in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals in Japan and public hospitals such as Japan Red Cross, which judged that "the medical record is poor."
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and the four facilities were covered by the National Hospital Organization of the city, Awara Hospital, Game Sakai City Three Kingdoms Hospital, GameEchizen-cho Oda Hospital, GameKohama-cho.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote restructuring and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals nearby will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%) were higher.
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
The team analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital should be considered to be abolished and some departments should be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1,246 thousand beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds for "high-acute" and "acute" periods in which nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are taken, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for elderly people.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, municipalities and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain a cautious attitude, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive disaster prevention training such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road etc. Wide area with participation of residents, for the first time in 18 years (video): Hokkaido Shimbun
A comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held on September 27 in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people attended the event, including 20 officials and residents of the roads and three towns.

At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in forests and Nanae-cho, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.
100,000 students protest against school holidays and global warming in Vancouver - Yahoo!
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall to the Canby Bridge and downtown library.
A few hours before the start of the meeting, people with placards began to gather in front of the city hall, and at 13 o'clock at the start time, the number of people who fill the city hall front block road was enough.
The number of participants continued to increase and eventually over 100,000 people participated.
On the road along the way, the police also cooperated with the road regulations and watched for hours until all people finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York, Vancouver has held a number of events to consider global warming since the last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school on this day complained to the adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I take a break from the school," and many adults who took part in the work off responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously considering learning."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
On March 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of the "Tonk cholera" disease, which is not currently recognized, from vaccination against domestic pigs.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
Live pigs and fertilized eggs vaccinated are restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (the public offering of opinions), we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the revised draft, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "prevention zone" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, how to proceed, etc., and will be confirmed by the ministry and allow the use by the governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga are recommended for vaccination.
When the guidelines have been revised, the region will review the situation and make decisions extremely once again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, excreted objects, etc. is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they effectively tolerate distribution outside the region.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 distribution
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and Keisuke Honda, a former member of the Japan National Team, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, made a public approach to a club: "Please give me an offer, I don't need money, but I need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of the ongoing crisis of injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip hard, challenging the quality of the front line.
As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a potential new force candidate for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole Andreas Pereira fills."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward for the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines, "PokeTalk," at its member offices for free.
It is the first time in Japan that the translators will be deployed in a concentrated manner in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60% of the population.
The map app "Google Map" started to show where to rent it, so that you can see the location of "stores for foreign languages" on your smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Pokettalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu" by 9 organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representative of the Chamber said, "I would like to help foreign customers develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
right now, you don't need to tie up the first hit, right?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not necessarily a tie-up.
There is also the so-called "naodora" technique when you want to make a distance by hitting a ball on the ground when you want to make a second hit of par 5 etc.
In recent years, 1W has a high head volume, which entails the risk of scattering balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, he is 166 cm in height and is currently ranked seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't want to shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I would try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped to the top of the grass in the Tie area, and sometimes a 1W swing is made.
In cases where big carry is required, a lot of tiUP is used, but both sides make effective use of Naodora in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
In the ballistic instruments, Carrie recorded between 270 and 280 yd.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17° UT.
The tactics that can be surprised by the tour companions are also pleasant to hear the exclamation from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club horizontally."
"Even with a down blow, I can't fly straight even if I hit the upper.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a straight drum to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
The ball is not caught and is associated with risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off (not bent to the left) ."
It is a professional skill that you can not help but say to Kantan.

GQ Men's 10 Day 9 Skateboarding with Friends - Yahoo!
The only way to move is skateboarding!
I've been hooked since my friend invited me to slide.
I'm still a beginner, but it feels good to run through the asphalt with push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because it can be hands-free with smartphones, wallets and luggage.
It feels good to feel the wind directly with the shorts.
Of course, it's light with Converse skateboard shoes.
Fashion and culture around skateboards are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram carefully!
Haircuts also went to a salon run by a hairdresser in Yutenji.
I was inspired by the tricks that I couldn't do at all and the information about skateboard park.
After school, our daily routine is to walk around the city with friends and skateboards.

[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Political commentators stated on American television that Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing," and apologized to the television station.
In Japan, there are many reports online that comment on Greta's comments, such as "I feel sorry for being used" "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
come up with all the lies and conspiracy theories you can think of.
Greta began writing, "You see, it started again, and as you realize, those who hate me are as active as ever, chasing around my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come up with the possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seem to be distracting from the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, climate change strikes took place in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta also called for a Friday of 27th.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not able to stretch well.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip in eagle came at #6.
I was able to catch the 7th and get a chance, but I regret not being able to stretch in the second half.
what did you get here?
I haven't been in good condition recently, so I was glad that I could keep it firmly even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance changed.
What is the difference from a regular tournament?
(Smartphones, etc.) It seems that camera shooting was possible.
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
There were not many other things that changed, but since there were few Japanese players in co-hosting the tournament, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you shouldn't aim for the prize king, so I would like to win another.
What is the method to prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be kept to the extent that it is extremely mild and forgetful.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I talked to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have decreased due to drastic advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay "forget things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can only vaguely see TV, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books daily and think about things that are not metabolized.
