Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo! News
Violations against Road Traffic Law
The number of reports on accidents caused by errors such as pedal treading is increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 people aged 24 or younger were killed, surpassing 1032 people aged 75 or older.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to come from the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to mistake inadvertently due to other things such as music and conversation, and trampling due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pumps, sandals, mules, and others drive as they are.
Although some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes, some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Law.
The first is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations are operated. Article 70 of the Act stipulates that the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people.
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.For example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, there is a sentence that "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations."
Even if it is not specified as a high heel, the purpose of each prefecture is similar to that of being considered as a violation of driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation."
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first put the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that it does not blur.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and it always blurs out as a gravure, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is smaller and it is difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be firmly trampled.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull high heels, and when it comes to sudden braking, the heels are pulled and the pedals are not trampled, or the high heels are removed in the time signature that the heels are pulled, and the pedals are stuck in the back of the pedals.
In addition, there is a case where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., which manufactures "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the frequent earthquake and tsunami that led to the rise in consumer tile roofs.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code:53173983, capital of 91.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, and Daichi Yoshida Law Office, telephone 06-6365-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., but at the same time, the head office was moved to its present location after changing its current business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70% and Ibushi-gawara was manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand continued to grow due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
On the profit side, in addition to a decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit with excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make severe financial arrangements.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of borrowings, but there were no signs of a recovery in business conditions, and the financial position gradually became tight.
I couldn't help but gave up on business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

This film is a painful story in which Yakuza and the head of the Tokimoto group, who are not interested in contributing to society, undertake the reconstruction of high school on the verge of bankruptcy, and resolve various difficult issues with Giri's feelings.
Nishida plays the head of the group that is strong but somehow unfavorable, and Nishijima plays Himura, the No. 2 of the Akimoto group that has always been choreographed to his parents.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I've been nervous until today."

The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Saijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drink too much, often I do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he is getting hurt," and "It looks like a silaf, but I was drunk?It's a really good hangover," and attracted laughter at the venue.
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida showed his willingness to "make a series if reputation is good, I would like to work hard to make a series with your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to make a series," Nakao said, "I am sorry because Nishida was singing when I watched the movie.

is beauty and ugliness a piece of paper?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadow in common?
A number of works have been sent out to the world since the 1950s, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019 focusing on beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Baizu, who is known as the leading figure of "The Fear Manga."
When I look at it with my hands, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of the work without Baizu again.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
5 beautiful girls of the work without Baizu
In the preface of "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when they have the beauty of the opposite," but because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of the grudge that dwells in the grudge ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "snakes" of the living things in the front and back.
This creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga Kowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is in common with the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu works, but in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, and the part with strange power somehow reminiscent of "snake."

"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Ababir" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the US military that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to catch radar because it flies low." (Toru Yokota, a news photographer)
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran, under the leadership of President Rouhani, is behind the Fusi faction, and it is unacceptable that Saudi Arabia, which is hostile to Iran, is making crude oil in a situation where its own country is not able to export crude oil, and it aims to inform the international community if oil embargo measures continue to be taken against Iran, accompanied by corresponding pain."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's elections, we want to avoid any military intervention, and Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever, and there is sufficient possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" is in imminent danger.
The reason why YouTuber, a super personality, became a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it to advertise their products, some companies have started a unique system called "YouTuber Adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX) is a major business of corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary that actually adopted YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with youtuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter, Kobayashi): Now, YouTuber is a profession that many young people have longed for.
It is also ranked in the career rankings that elementary school students want to get in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "YouTuberr Adoption" to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
There is an image that YouTuber is something that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber can't get the revenue that they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we hired.
At first, we will support the demerits of the profession called YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary of State (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 27 that he hoped that Korea would reconsider and return the decision to destroy Japan and Korea's military information comprehensive protection agreement, which would expire on November 23.
It is unusual for high-ranking U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, Japan, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argues that without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis.
"There is time until the revocation," he strongly urged the return of Korea.
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan was "for the first time in history."
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

After working on the town development of Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi, he joined Echizen City in April this year.
In the same city that produced Satoko KAKO and Chihiro IWASAKI, he aims to create a town using picture books.
Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion around me for the first time."
What attracted attention was the legend of the city of Awara, "The face of the demon of the bride and daughter."
It is a story that a gentle married woman continues to chant Nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) to help her mother without worrying about being surprised by her face.
"I forgot my hatred and returned with kindness and kindness, and I felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Mr. Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived, and he completed the story "Meoto Oni" where a husband and wife of a gentle demon and a boy appeared.
From June, he took advantage of his job to draw 10 scenes with warm watercolors, and the materials of picture books were scattered.
In addition, the cover of picture books will be made of Japanese paper using Echizen Washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
This leads to an opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the touch of Japanese paper through reading and listening.
The goal of the donation amount is 850,000 yen for 600 copies.
The deadline is 25 October.
Mr. Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud throughout Japan.
I want to convey the true kindness and compassion that has been handed down to children through picture books."

i want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4.

The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the letter "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4.
The accuracy of the information is also high on the official website.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a subdisplay of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better with more perfection (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation of macOS.

The photo was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1 to 5 km off the coast of Kamahara district, Shimizu Ward, the city.
A total of 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.
During the day, the traditional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea form a certain group at the bottom of the sea was refuted.
The adult body is about 40 mm long, and the individual reflected is about 23 mm long.
The spawning season was identified by matching data from season to season of freshly caught sakura shrimp.
Detailed analysis is requested by Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Technical College, which make up the team.
Keisuke Mizuno, Project Leader, said, "I want to capture the living figure of individuals in the growth process, including fry."

[The first half of the bad Olympics race] world champion Kento Momoda and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the Badminton Big Event in August and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, finished the training camp in early September and participated in the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic Games from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the midfield race (September to December).
The Badminton Olympics, which began in May, digested four of the top athletes (Super 500 or higher) at the end of the World Championship.
The two most successful players in the first half were Kento Momota, who won 2 of the 4 races, and Shu Tensei (Cho Tienchen) in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been held in four groups: the Sudirman Cup (May / China), the Indonesia OP (July / results are 16 strong), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of top players is small, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the part.
In August, only one World Championship race was held, so fatigue would not be greater than during wartime.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
He was a strong Taiwanese ace in the series.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to earn high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and it was able to continue its good performance firmly.
For Momota, who is the number one in the world ranking, it seems to be a more difficult opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantafon does not advance to the final in the top tournament, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the top 4 in the second tournament this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th) who is able to rally against the top players has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Planis B. has also taken a step away in India, where he has a great selection of singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who are late due to injury, will also be catching up in the future, so the Indian forces after the midfield battle must be careful.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in response to the revision of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40 percent," and although expectations for price reduction were increasing, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry was postponed and the oligopoly state of the three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device a maximum of half the price.
However, both companies can't use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will use up to one-third of the terminal fee for subscribers of its own lines.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has issued a policy requiring immediate cancellation.
The company needs to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be an explosive for lower price competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
This revision of the fee triggered the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I do not think that it will be good."
However, the government-made price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by users themselves.
Cache card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
The three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, the Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they decided to reduce the maximum amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank lowered the Kihoku Shinkin Bank from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions and police officials, etc., and those in the Shinkin Bank say, "I want to protect customers' important deposits in the best possible way."
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNA | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.

The Izutsu Chikakata died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same Kagamiyama room, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & brawl Foreign ripple "Following and vulgar play" in "face risk tackle" of US players - Yahoo! News
FL Quill in the United States is a rough play, former England national "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was held on the 26th, with the United States losing 7-45 to England.
It began as a black star, but Lafplay, played by FL John Quill in the latter half, called the ripple.
He leaves the scene with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by foreign media with video, and former English players also complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insulting and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply entrenched in the enemy's field, was somewhat out of balance when catching his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent come into contact, and it is shaped like a head piercing.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against the play, apparently lacking legitimacy, trying to fly Quill.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play to boo.
The local media "staff" of New Zealand, a strong rugby player, features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving" "It was almost a struggle by both sides."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a pitiful play."
The United States, which lacked a single player in the game, managed to escape the final defeat in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced for the first time on September 26, 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, including Japan and the Red Cross, which judged that their medical records were poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of straw City, Game Sakai City Three Kingdom Hospital, Game Oda Hospital in Echizen Town, Game Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to an aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals nearby will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, as well as whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital will be considered to be abolished and some departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1,246 thousand beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are well placed and medical expenses are taken, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
The entire country is divided into 339 areas, with local governments and medical officials discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.

Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced on July 27 an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of Ton cholera, a domestic infectious disease.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been confirmed to be infected.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but distribution outside the meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (an open call for opinions), we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been temporarily on hold.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "recommended area for vaccination" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, how to proceed, etc., and will be confirmed by the province and allowed to use it at the governor's discretion.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines have been revised, the region will look at the situation and decide extremely once again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excreted objects is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it practically accepts distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, we will conduct opinion inquiries and public comments to prefectures until October 7 and implement new quarantine guidelines.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
He left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League last season, and Keisuke Honda, a former member of the Australian national team, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could grab in the midst of a crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up for the current win.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United is in a state of emergency, with injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshar, is forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and is challenged by the quality of the front line.
Honda was named by the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for the Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill a hole in Andreas Pereira."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that " 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward for the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and shops | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on February 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu.
It is the first time in Japan that the translators will be deployed intensively in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" started to show where to rent, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" was shown on the smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Poketok, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu."
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representative of the Chamber said, "I would like to help foreign customers develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
right now, you don't need to tie up the first hit, right?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not necessarily tiring.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique, which is to hit a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of the par 5.
Recent 1Ws involve the risk of scattering balls due to the large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, he is 166 cm in height and is currently ranked seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W), so I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tirea, and sometimes a 1W is shaken.
In the case where big carry is required, a lot of tiUP is used, but both sides are used effectively in a narrow hall.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded between 270 and 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I am also happy to hear the exclamation from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I was originally doing a straight drum to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
The ball is not caught, and it is associated with the risk of slice, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It is a professional skill that you can not help but say to Kantan.

The only way to move is by skateboarding!
I have been hooked since my friend invited me to slide.
I am still a beginner, but it feels good if I run through the asphalt with push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because it can be hands-free with smartphones, wallets and luggage.
With the shorts, you can feel the wind directly and feel good.
Of course, it is light with Converse skateboard shoes.
Fashion and culture around skateboarding are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram carefully!
I also went to a salon run by a hairdresser in Yutenji.
I was inspired by the tricks I couldn't do at all, the information about skateboard park, and so on.

The adults pointed out that they did not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seemed to be distracting from the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!

[Video] Come to Japan!
Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to expand to the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not good enough and I could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip in eagle came at #6.
I was able to get a chance with Bardi on #7, but I regret not being able to reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I could keep it firmly even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance was changed.
what's the difference?
(Smartphones, etc.) It seems that camera shooting was possible.
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for galleries.
There were not many other things that changed, but since there were only few Japanese players in co-hosts, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the race will continue from now on, but if you do not win more than one, you should not aim for the prize king, so I want to win another one, and there is also a ZOZO championship near, so I will try hard to get the qualification to the top in that tournament.
How do you prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting"?
Interview: Yo WATANABE
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I spoke to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepegil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are decreasing due to drastic advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can only vaguely see TV, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books daily and think about things that are not metabolized.
