Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo! News
Violations against Road Traffic Law
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading is increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, the number of accidents involving pedal treading by age is 1080 more than 24 years old, exceeding 1032 more than 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
will you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to come from the decline of the body such as driving skills and reflexes, it is possible for young people to inadvertently miss music, conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on their day's clothing, such as high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules, and some people drive as they are.
Although some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes, some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.
The first is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations are operated. Article 70 of the Act stipulates that "the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the respective prefectural public safety committees, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operation, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operation, such as slippers, hanging, high heels, etc."
Even if it is not specified as a high heel, the purpose of each prefecture is to consider driving as a violation of " footwear that may interfere with driving operation."
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the foot's heel on the floor, place the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that it does not blur.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs out, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot where the pedal is grounded is also smaller, making it difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be firmly trampled.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get a high heel shape, and sometimes when it comes to sudden braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be stepped on, or the high heel is removed in the time signature that the heel is pulled, and it can not be stepped inside the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., which manufactures "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to repeated earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code:53173983, capital of 9.92 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, and Daichi Yoshida Law Office, telephone number 06-6365-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (now Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., but at the same time, the head office was moved to its present location after changing its present trade name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70% and Ibushi-gawara was manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand continued to grow due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
In terms of profits, in addition to a decline in profitability due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to carry out severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of borrowings, but there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and the funding situation gradually became tight.
I couldn't help but gave up on business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs disappeared, and the Cubs' Darbish pitcher (33) who finished the pitch this season told the interview that "I have not done anything for two days, but it is hard to see baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses and a defensive margin of 3 and 98.
Especially in the second half of the game, the throwing form stabilized and continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball power.
"I was 33 years old, and I didn't think I would feel that way.In spring I thought, "I wonder if I'm going to end this way too," but when I came back from there, I felt that I could not believe that I could go to a better place."
I was able to respond gradually from early June.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased, and the number of things we can do every day has increased."
There was trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that he had established one after another, his condition improved dramatically and his grades improved accordingly.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt-out after the end of this season to cancel the contract, says, "I have to think about it now, I'm going to talk to agents and families," but "Basically, there is no dissatisfaction or fun about this team."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling seems to be firm.

According to the Water and Sewerage Department of the City Bureau of Enterprises, seven condominiums in one year after the earthquake installed "watering plugs" that could produce water even if the power outage occurred.

This film is a painful story in which Yakuza and the head of the Tokimoto group, who are not interested in contributing to society, undertake the reconstruction of high school on the verge of bankruptcy, and resolve many difficult issues with Giri Ninjo.
Nishida plays the leader of the group who is strong but doesn't hate somewhere, and Nishijima plays Himura, who is the No. 2 of the Akimoto group that has always been choreographed by his parents.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I have been nervous until today."
"Not only during the shooting period, but also after the shooting, the members gathered all the time and were a team that was so united that they talked about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was just a drinking party called a review meeting that didn't reflect on at all," and "It was a positive thing for the site to make such a time, team work became better and motivation increased.Even after the end, it continued regularly, and there are lots of good memories."
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Nishijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drink too much, often I do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he is getting hurt," and "It looks like a silaf, but I was drunk?It's a really good hangover," and attracted the laughter of the venue.
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to "make a series if reputation is good, I would like to do my best to make a series with your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to make a series," Nakao said, "I would like to sing this time after watching the movie.

With the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident at TEPCO, discussions on the test operation that continues with fisheries off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture toward full-scale operation in each district and other areas became concrete.
Mr. Tetsu Nozaki said, "As a prefectural fishing association, we need a flow toward full-scale operation, and we want to gather representatives and start discussions."
The Union Presidents' Association also approved the formal addition of the fish species to the target species for test operations in the areas of Casago, Sakura Mas and Murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, where shipping restrictions were lifted.
The remaining undisclosed seafood became two fish species: the benothgai and the common cusp.
At the end of the meeting, President Nozaki told reporters that the start of full-scale operations was not fixed.
In response to the treatment water after purifying contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, Mr. Yoshiaki Harada, Minister for the Environment, and Mayor Ichiro Matsui, Mayor of Osaka City, said, "The debate with a sense of resilience is a problem, and the position against the release of the ocean remains unchanged."
In discussing the full-scale operation, Akira Egawa, head of Iwaki City Fisheries Cooperative, pointed out that "it is necessary to suck up opinions from below," and said that the members respect their intentions.
A board meeting is held where the affiliated branch offices gather to resolve each problem and make a conclusion as a city fishing cooperative.

beauty and ugliness?
The image of "snake" overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!
Is the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadow in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I take it and look at it, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of the work without Baizu again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's works
In the preface of the Beauty Girl Collection, there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when they have the beauty of the opposite," but because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face changes to the expression of distortion and resentment ... ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "snakes" of creatures in the front and back.
This creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga Kowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say that it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu works, but in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, and the part with mysterious power somehow reminiscent of "snake."

[Yokoyama Wakamizu] There is a circle of children's cafeterias that offer free or inexpensive meals for children nationwide.

It has increased by one to six times compared to 2018, and there are 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by nine compared to last year.
why is it now?
Makoto Yuasa, chairman of the Kyoto NPO and social activist, spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "We needed a place where people could interact with each other.
It is a place of multi-generational exchange where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
what's important is not to create children from there
There are various places to offer meals every day from January 1st.
There are a wide variety of venues, from several to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
There is an atmosphere that people who want to do can do.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes we hear issues like a secure management system
Even though it is said that " values change by engaging with many people" "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," Yuasa said.
It seems like the light of hope in closed society.

"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Ababir" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of U.S. forces that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to catch radar because it flies low." (Toru Yokota, a news photographer)
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Houthis faction, under President Rouhani's leadership, that under circumstances where the country is unable to export crude oil, the hostile Saudi Arabia will not be able to make a profit from crude oil; if Iran continues to embargo crude oil, it will be aimed at informing the international community of the pain associated with it."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's elections, we want to avoid any military intervention, and after that, Iran will continue to bomb the Hoosiers with drones, but the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever.
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" is in imminent danger.
The reason YouTuber became a full-time employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it to advertise their products, some companies have started a unique system called "YouTuber Adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary of YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people have longed for.
It is also ranked in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber Adoption" is to adopt and support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber can't get the revenue they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation for creators hired.
At first, we will support the demerits of the profession called YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.
Environmental Girl: Fight for a Safe Future Protests worldwide for two consecutive weeks | Shizuoka Shimbun
On the 27th, Greta Tunberg (center) and others (Router-Joint) participated in a protest in Montreal, eastern Canada.
[New York Joint] Swedish girl Greta Thunberg (16) took part in a protest in Montreal, eastern Canada on the 27th and stressed that she "continues to fight for a safe future."

"South Korea wants to return to GSOMIA." - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the official residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the United States in Tokyo, said on November 27 that he hoped that Korea would reconsider and return the decision to destroy Japan and Korea's military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse in Japan and Korea.
Napper argues that without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to crises.
He strongly urged the return of Korea, saying, "There is time until the revocation."
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan was "for the first time in history."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damaged the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

i want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new OS macOS Catalina will be released in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[View All Images] The release date of macOS Catalina may be October 4th.
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the letter "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4.
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better with more perfection (or response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation of macOS.
Sakura shrimp in the growth process PT in Shizuoka City, etc., taken at 290 meters deep | Shizuoka Shimbun
Sakura Ebi, born this year, has been successfully photographed in the deep sea of Suruga Bay.
The Yuhi Sakura Ebi Project, a project of the Ocean Industry Cluster Council led by industry, academia, and government in Shizuoka City, has succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp, which is thought to have been born during the spawning season this spring and summer, at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the concerned parties want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photograph was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1 to 5 km off the coast of the Kamahara district of Shimizu Ward, the city.
A total of 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.
In the daytime, the traditional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea form a certain group at the bottom of the sea was re-established.
The adult body is about 40 mm long, and the individual reflected is about 23 mm long.

[The first half of the bad Olympics race] world champion Kento Momoda and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the Badminton Big Event in August and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic Games from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the middle race (September to December).
The Badminton Olympics, which began in May, digested four of the top athletes (Super500 and above) at the end of the World Championships.
The two most successful players in the first half were Kento Momota, who won 2 of the 4 races, and Tensei (Cho Tien Cheng) of Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been held in four categories: the Sudirman Cup (May in China), the Indonesia OP (July in Indonesia), the Japan OP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was only one of the World Championships, fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
A strong Taiwanese ace against consecutive battles.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), already made seven appearances.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
As the tournament continues, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to score high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, allowing him to continue his good performance.
For Momota, who is the number one in the world ranking, it seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the final in the top tournament, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the top 4 in the second tournament this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th) who is able to rally against the top players has a great potential to leap forward in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranice B. has also taken a step forward in India, where singles have good players.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who are late due to injury, are also catching up in the future, so the Indian forces after the midfield battle need to be careful.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released due to the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it almost stopped.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40 percent," and although expectations for price reduction were rising, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market has been postponed and the oligopolistic status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to increase the number of devices to half.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will charge up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has issued a policy requiring immediate cancellation.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten was due to the fact that the maintenance of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
It was expected to be an explosive for lower price competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
This revision of the fee triggered the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I do not think that it will be okay."
However, the government-made price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
Each company's fee system is very complex and difficult to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings of users themselves.

The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one sumo wrestler from Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI (former Sekiwaki fukubo).

On the 16th, Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same Kagamiyama room, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One Outbreak & Struggle Overseas ripples in "face-dangerous tackle" of U.S. players " insulting and cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
F.C. Quill, a former England national, played rough.
The Rugby World Cup Japan was held on the 26th, with the United States losing 7-45 to England.
It started out as a black star, but Lafplay, played by FL John Quill in the latter half of the year, called the crest.
He leaves the scene with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players also complained that "an insulting and cowardly play" "is not a tackle."
[Video] "An insulting and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
As the English captain Farrell caught the pass of his ally, he was somewhat out of balance.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head of the opponent is in contact with the head, and the shape that pierces the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against the play, apparently lacking legitimacy, trying to penetrate Quill.
Both players gathered at once and became an instant air of touch.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some people asked for a fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving" "It was almost a struggle by both sides."
The article introduces the comments of former England international player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, a coward, not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked a single player in the game, managed to escape the final defeat in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced for the first time on September 26, 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, including Japan and the Red Cross, which judged that their medical record was poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare verified the treatment record of 14 public and public hospitals.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to reduce medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals nearby will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals covered was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 public and public hospitals that can respond to "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital should consider abolishing and transferring some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1,246 thousand beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high-acute" and "acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 districts, with municipalities and medical officials discussing the issue, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and debates are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive drill for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road etc. Wide area with participation of residents, for the first time in 18 years (video): Hokkaido Shimbun

Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall across the Canby Bridge to the downtown library.
A few hours before the start of the meeting, people with placards began to gather in front of the city hall, and at 13 o'clock at the start time, the number of people who fill the road in front of the city hall block was enough.
The number of participants continued to increase and eventually over 100,000 people participated.

The students who took part in the school on this day complained to adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I take a break from the school," and many adults who took part in the work off responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced on September 27 an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of Ton cholera, a disease of livestock transmission, from vaccination against domestic pigs that are not currently recognized.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been confirmed to be infected.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but distribution outside the meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (an open call for opinions), we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "prevention zone" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed, and is approved by the Ministry and allowed to use it at the governor's discretion.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines have been revised, the region will look at the situation and decide extremely once again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excreted objects, in principle, is restricted to the region.
As for meat and processed products, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it virtually accepts distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and Keisuke Honda, the former Japan national team who is currently independent, took an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, made a public approach to a club: "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of the ongoing crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshar, is forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses.
As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a potential new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole Andreas Pereira fills."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward for the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce, stores, etc. | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines, "PokeTalk," at its member offices for free.
It is the first time in Japan that the translators are deployed intensively in the same region, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" also started to show the location of "stores for foreign languages" on smartphones.
It is accessible from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Pokettalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representative of the Chamber said, "I would like to help foreign customers develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
right now, you don't need to tie up the first hit, right?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not necessarily tying up.
There is also the so-called "naodora" technique to hit a ball on the ground when you want to make a distance by hitting the second hit of the par 5.
Recently, 1W has the risk of scattering balls due to its large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kansei is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, 24 years old is 166 cm tall and small, but he is currently seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "Because the shot of the spoon (3W) was not good, I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tirea, and sometimes one W is shaken.
In the case where big carry is required, the tip is often used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
The ballistic instruments recorded 270 to 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W, so Cardy can feel more secure than 3W..."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I am also happy to hear the exclamation from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club horizontally."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, you go to the right.I used to do a straight drum to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
The ball does not catch and is associated with the risk of slice, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It is a professional skill that you can not help but say to Kantan.

On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
come up with all the lies and conspiracy theories you can think of.
Greta began writing, "You see, it started again, and as you realize, those who hate me are as active as ever, chasing around my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come up with the possible lies and conspiracy theories."
The adults pointed out that they did not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seemed to be distracting from the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with the momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not well and could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there were still par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of retaking it, the chip in eagle came at #6.
It was a chance for Bardi to be caught in #7, but I regret not being able to reach in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I could keep it firmly even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the roughness and the reverse direction were separated and the distance changed.
What is the difference from a regular tournament?
(Smartphone, etc.) It seems that camera shooting was possible.
I didn't care at all, but the gallery people were filming videos.
There were not many other changes, but since there were only few Japanese players in co-hosting the tournament, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for the winning king, so I want to win another one.
How do I prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with their research and development challenges.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I spoke to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepegil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are decreasing due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things about forgetting
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people with metabolic syndrome tend to become dementia.
Dementia is perceived as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are stored frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
Eventually, poverty becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can only vaguely see TV, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books everyday, not metabolizing.
