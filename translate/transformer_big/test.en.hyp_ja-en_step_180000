Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo! News
Violations against Road Traffic Law
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading is increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, there are more than 1080 cases in the age of 24 years old and 1032 cases over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to mistake inadvertently due to other things such as music and conversation, and mistakes due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pumps, sandals, mules, and others drive as they are.
Some people say it is troublesome to change clothes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all and drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Law.
The first is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes and other operations are operated. Article 70 of the Act stipulates that the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people.
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the respective prefectural public safety committees, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, for example, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations, such as slippers, hanging, high heels, etc."
Even if it is not specified as a high heel, the purpose of each prefecture is the same as to consider driving as a violation of " footwear that may hinder operation."
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first put the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that it does not blur.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs out, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller, making it difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be firmly trampled.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch a high heel or heel, and when it comes to sudden braking, the pedal cannot be stepped on, or the high heel can be removed from the time signature that the heel is pulled, and it can not be stepped by pinching the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of Awaji tiles, filed for quasi-self-insolvency Liabilities of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to the frequent disaster.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code:53173983, capital of 9.92 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, and Daichi Yoshida Law Office, telephone number 06-6365-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (now Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd., succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., and at the same time, the head office was moved to the present location after changing the business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat-paned tiles were manufactured at 70%, and Ibushi-gawara was manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand continued to grow due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent disaster such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
In terms of profits, in addition to a decline in profitability due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make a severe financial position.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, but there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and the funding situation gradually became tight.
He was unable to support the project and gave up on continuing the business.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs disappeared, and the Cubs' Darbish pitcher (33) who finished the pitch this season responded to the interview, saying "I haven't done anything for two days, but it's hard to see baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses, 3 and 98 defenses, but lost 229 by throwing 2/3 of 178 times.
Especially in the second half of the game, the throwing form was stable and he continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball power.
"I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be that kind of feeling.In spring I thought, "I wonder if I'm going to end this way too," but I feel that I can't believe that I came back from there and went to a better place."
From around the beginning of June, I gradually got a response.
"The more things we can do every day, the more we can do every day."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that he had established one after another, his condition improved dramatically and his grades improved accordingly.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without being listed as injured throughout the year.
Dalvish, who has the right to opt out of the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it now, I'm going to talk to my agents and my family."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling seems to be firm.

Even if the water pipe is not damaged, electric pumps that pump water from the water tank into each door will not be able to run due to power failure, and each door will be cut off.

Nishida plays the leader of the group that is strong but doesn't hate somewhere, and Nishijima plays Himura, who is the number 2 of the Akimoto group that has always been choreographed by his parents.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I've been nervous until today."
"Not only during the shooting period, but also after the filming ended, the members gathered all the time and were so united that they were talking about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was just a drinking party called a review meeting that did not reflect on at all" "It was a positive thing for the site to make such a time, team work became better and motivation increased.Even after the end, it continued regularly and there are lots of good memories," he said.
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Nishijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drink too much, often I do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he's getting hurt," and "It looks like a silaf, but I was drunk?It's a really good hangover."
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to "make it a series if reputation is good."I would like to work hard to make it a series with your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to make it a series," Nakao said, "We were disappointed because Nishida was singing when we watched the movie.

beauty and ugliness?
The image of "snake" overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is the mysterious beauty and the expression of the shadow in common?
"Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I look at it in my hand, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Baizu Kazuo's work again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's works
In the preface of "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of the girls who are at the opposite end."
There is a keyword "snake" in many of the works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly" may be "snakes" of the living things in the front and back.
Also, this creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga Kowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which has been serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu works, but in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, and the part with mysterious power somehow evokes "snake."

Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely, and shopping streets declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "We needed a place where people could interact with each other.
Even though it is called the Kyoto Children's Cafeteria, it is a place of multi-generational exchange where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
what's important is not to create children from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day from January 1 to May 1.
There are a wide variety of venues, from several to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
It is becoming an atmosphere that people who want to do can do.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.

"Connecting with society will become a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in closed society.

"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Ababir" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the US forces that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
In order to fly low, it is also a strength that it is difficult to get caught by radar."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Houthi faction, led by President Rouhani, that under circumstances where the country cannot export crude oil, it cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make a profit from crude oil; if Iran continues to embargo crude oil against Iran, it aims to inform the international community that the pain associated with it will be accompanied."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's elections, we want to avoid any military intervention, and after that, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Houthis faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever, and there is enough possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" is in imminent danger.
This is why YouTuber has become a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it to advertise their products, some companies have started an unusual system called YouTuber adoption, which they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Subsidiary and Staff First, which is actually YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter "Kobayashi"): Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people admire.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber adoption" aims to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers don't get what they think.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation for creators hired.
At first, we will support activities by supporting the disadvantage of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary of State (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 27 that "Korea hopes to reconsider and return the decision to destroy the military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23."
It is unusual for high-ranking U.S. officials to mention reconsidering the destruction of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
He strongly urged Korea to return to Korea, saying, "There is time until revocation."
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan was "for the first time in history."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damaged the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap."

According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th.
[View All Images] The release date of macOS Catalina may be October 4th.
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the character "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4.
The accuracy of the information is also high on the official website.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a subdisplay of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better with more perfection (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation macOS.
Sakura shrimp during the growth process PT such as Shizuoka City, depth 290 meters taken | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
Sakura Ebi, born this year, has been successfully photographed in the deep sea of Suruga Bay.
The Yuhi Sakura Ebi Project, a project of the Ocean Industry Cluster Council led by industry, academia, and government officials in Shizuoka City, succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp, which is thought to have been born during the spawning season this spring and summer, at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the concerned parties want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photo was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1 to 5 km off the coast of Kamahara district, Shimizu Ward, the city.
A total of 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.
During the day, the traditional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea form a certain group at the bottom of the sea was reaffirmed.
The adult body is about 40 mm long, and the individual reflected is about 23 mm long.
The spawning period was identified by matching the seasonal data of the freshly caught sakura shrimp.

[The first half of the bad Olympics race] World champion Kento Momota and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the Badminton Big Event in August and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic Games from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the midfield Games (September to December).
The Badminton Olympic Games, which began in May, digested four of the top athletes (Super500 and above) at the end of the World Championships.
Two key players in the first half were Kento Momota, who won two of the four races, and Tensei (Cho Tienchen) in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championships and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been held in four groups: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/results are 16 strong), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the wartime.
A good result is required in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
Taiwan's strong ace against consecutive battles.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), already participated in seven tournaments.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
As a result, the player has a strong physical strength and does not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the tournament continues, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to earn high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and it became possible to continue the good performance firmly.
For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the final at the top level, he has the power to advance to the top level, such as entering the top 4 in the second round this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is able to rally against the top players has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Planis B. has also taken a step forward in India, where he has a great selection of singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who are late for injury, are also catching up in the future, so the Indian forces after the midfield battle need to be careful.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as a result of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40 percent," and although expectations for price reduction were rising, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been postponed and the oligopolistic status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device a maximum of half the price.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will charge up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies must respond promptly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be an explosive in price-cutting competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
This revision of the price triggered the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition is going to start in the future, and I do not think that it will be good."
However, the government-made price reduction does not seem to distort the market and promote sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
Each company's fee system is very complex and difficult to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount of advertising such as "maximum half price."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by themselves.
Cash Cards for 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun

The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI (former Sekiwaki Retrohoko).

There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & brawl Overseas ripples in "face risk tackle" of U.S. players " insult and cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
U.S. F. Quill played rough and was a former England national "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was held on the 26th, with the United States losing 7-45 to England.
It began as a black star, but Lafplay, played by FL John Quill in the latter half, called the ripple.
One shot leaves in the form of adding shoulder tackle to the opponent's face.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insult and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply entrenched in the enemy's field, was somewhat out of balance when catching his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the opponent's head and head are in contact with the shape that pierces the head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
English players protested against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once and became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
Bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, which left him."
The article introduces the comments of former England international player and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked a single player in the game, managed to escape the loss in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced for the first time on September 26, 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, including Japan and the Red Cross, which judged that their medical record was poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of Awa City, and Awara Hospital, and Awara Hospital, respectively.
⇒ Four hospitals subject to reorganization: Criteria Funny
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals nearby will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
The team analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital should be considered to be abolished and to transfer some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1,246 thousand beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high-acute" and "acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing the issue.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) released on July 27 a proposal to revise the quarantine guidelines to prevent the spread of pork cholera, an infectious disease of livestock.
The prefecture plans to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been identified.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (an open call for opinions), we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "prevention area" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, how to proceed, etc.
Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga are the seven other prefectures that have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will look at the situation and decide extremely once again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excretions are limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they effectively tolerate distribution outside the region.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
Last season, he left the Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and Keisuke Honda, an unaffiliated former Japan national team, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, made a public approach to a club: "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, released on October 24.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of the ongoing crisis of injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United is in a state of emergency, with injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshar, is forced to slip hard in the league with 22 wins and 22 losses.
As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a potential new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill a hole in Andreas Pereira."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward for the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be their target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun at es
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that is freely loaned to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator intensively in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60% of the population.
The map app "Google Map" was also started to show the location of "stores for foreign languages" on smartphones.
It is accessible from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Poketok, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.

right now, you don't need to tie up the first hit.
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not necessarily tying up.
There is also the so-called "naodora" technique, which is to hit a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of par 5.
Recent 1Ws have the risk of scattering balls due to their large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kansei is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, 24 years old is 166 cm tall and small, but he is currently seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I should try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tirea, and sometimes a 1W is shaken.
In the case where big carry is required, the tip is often used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
The ballistic instruments recorded 270 to 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
The tactics that surprise the tour companions are also pleasant to hear from the gallery they saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, you can't fly straight even if you hit it with the upper.If it is a cut track, I go to the right.I was originally doing a straight drum to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
The ball does not catch and is associated with risk of slice, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It is a professional technique that you can not help but say to Kantan.

The means of transportation is exclusively skateboarding!
I have been hooked since my friend invited me to slide.
I am still a beginner, but it feels good to run through the asphalt with push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because it can be hands-free with smartphones, wallets and luggage.
With shorts, you can feel the wind directly and feel good.
Of course, it is light with Converse skateboard shoes.
Fashion and culture around skateboarding are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram carefully!
I also went to a salon run by a hairdresser of skaters in Yutenji.
I was inspired by the tricks I still can't do at all and the information about skateboard park.
After school, our daily routine is to walk around the city with friends and skateboards.

[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Political commentators stated on American television that Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing," and apologized for the role.
In Japan, there are many online reports that comment on the part that is not the content of Greta's remarks, such as "I feel sorry for being used" "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
come up with all the lies and conspiracy theories you can think of.
Greta began writing, "See, it started again, and as you realize, those who hate me are as active as ever, chasing around my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come up with as much lies and conspiracy theories as possible."
They pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seem to be questioning the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't spend your time paying more attention to them.
The world is starting to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, climate change strikes took place in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta also called for a Friday of the 27th.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with the momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the seater was not good enough to stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there were still par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of retaking it, the chip in eagle came at #6.
It was a chance for Bardi to be caught in #7, but I regret not being able to reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I could keep it firmly even on a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference?
It was possible to take a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for galleries.
There were not many other changes, but there were only a few Japanese players in the competition together, so I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for the winning king, so I want to win another.
How do you prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting things"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I spoke to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are decreasing due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the level of forgetting
― Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay "forgetting things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
Eventually, poverty becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can only vaguely watch TV, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books every day and think about things that are not metabolized.
