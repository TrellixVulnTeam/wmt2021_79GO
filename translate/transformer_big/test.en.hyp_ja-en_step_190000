Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo! News
Violations against Road Traffic Law
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading is increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 pedal misstep accidents occurred at the age of 24 and over 1032.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of gender ratio or cause in this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, it is possible for young people to take care of other things such as music and conversation and trampling errors due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day and drive as they are.
Some people say it is troublesome to change clothes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Law.
The first is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations are operated. Article 70 of the Act stipulates that "the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the respective prefectural public safety committees, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations, such as slippers, hanging, high heels, etc."
The purpose of each prefecture is similar to that of a violation of driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if it is not specified as high heels.
Why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and tilt the foot to the right as a starting point when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the heel does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs out, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal becomes smaller and it is difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be firmly trampled.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch a high heel or heel, in case of sudden braking, the heel is caught and the pedal cannot be stepped, or the high heel is removed in the time signature that the heel is caught, and it can not be stepped by pinching the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., which manufactures "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to repeated earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code: 530173983; capital of 9.92 million yen; 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture; representative Yukizo Fukuhara; 44 employees) filed for quasi-self bankruptcy at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, and Daichi Yoshida Law Office, telephone 06-6365-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70% and Ibushi-gawara was manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, consumer demand was sluggish, and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to approximately 1.345 million yen.
In terms of profits, in addition to a decline in profitability due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make a severe financial position.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of borrowings, but there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and funding gradually became tight.
I couldn't help but give up on business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs disappeared, and the Cubs' Darbish pitcher (33) who finished the pitch this season told the interview, "I have not done anything for two days, but it is hard to see baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses and a defensive margin of 3 and 98.
Especially in the latter half of the game, the throwing form stabilized and continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball power.
"I was 33 years old and I didn't think it would be that kind of feeling.In spring I thought, "I wonder if I'm going to end this way too," but I feel that I can't believe that I came back from there and went to a better place."
From around early June, I gradually got a response.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased, and the number of things we can do every day has increased."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that he had established himself one after another, his condition improved dramatically and his grades improved accordingly.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt out of the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it now, I'm going to talk to agents and families," but "Basically, there's nothing to complain about this team and it's fun."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling seems to be firm.

This work is a painful story in which Yakuza and the head of the Tokimoto group, who are not interested in contributing to society, undertake the reconstruction of high school on the verge of bankruptcy, and solve many difficult problems with Giri Ninjo.
Nishida plays the head of the group that is strong but somehow unfavorable, and Nishijima plays Himura, who is the number 2 of the Tokimoto group that has always been choreographed by his parents.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I've been nervous until today."
"Not only during the filming period, but also after the filming ended, the members gathered all the time and were a very united team that talked about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was just a drinking party called a review meeting that didn't reflect on at all," "It was a positive thing for the site to make such a time, team work became better, motivation increased, it continued regularly after the end, there are lots of good memories," he said.
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Nishijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drink too much, often I do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he is getting hurt," and "It looks like a silaf, but I was drunk?It's a really good hangover," and attracted laughter at the venue.
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to "make it a series if reputation is good, I would like to work hard to make it a series with your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to make it a series," Nakao said, "We were disappointed because Nishida was singing when we watched the movie.

beauty and ugliness?
The image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is there anything in common between mysterious beauty and the expression of shadow?
In August 2019, "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released.
When I look at it in my hand, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Baizu's work again.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's works
In the preface of the "Bijo Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when they have the beauty of the opposite," but because of the contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of the grudge that dwells in the grudge ... ...
There is a keyword "snake" in the many works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "snakes" of the living things in the front and back.
This creature has been worshipped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga Kowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu works, but deep sleep every 100 years to keep eternal life and eternal youth, and the part with mysterious power somehow reminiscent of "snake."

There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "We needed a place where people could interact with each other.
It is a place of multi-generational exchange, where elderly people also participate, even though it is called the Kyoto Children's cafeteria.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
what's important is not to create children from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day from January 1 to March 1.
There are a wide variety of venues ranging from private homes to temples.
It is becoming an atmosphere that people who want to do can do.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.

"Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It is like the light of hope in closed society.

"The Truth" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Ababir" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to catch radar because it flies in low air." (Toru Yokota, a news photographer)
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran, under President Rouhani's leadership, is behind the Houthi faction, and Iran cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil in a situation where its own country cannot export crude oil, with the aim of informing the international community that if Iran continues to embargo crude oil, it will suffer accordingly."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid military intervention at least until the end of next year's election, and Iran will continue to bomb the Hoosiers with drones, knowing that the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever, and there is enough possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's " proxy war" is in imminent danger.
The reason YouTuber became a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, some companies have started a unique system called "YouTuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (Customer Relationship Management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX, who is also a representative of the subsidiary and staff first who actually adopted YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
It is also ranked in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber adoption" is to adopt and support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers don't get the revenue they think.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation for the creators we hired.
At first, we will support activities by supporting the disadvantage of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA." - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 27 that he hoped that Korea would reconsider and return the decision to destroy Japan and Korea's comprehensive military information protection agreement, which expires on November 23.
It is unusual for a senior U.S. official to refer to a reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
South Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan in August, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse in Japan and South Korea.
Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
He strongly urged the return of Korea, saying, "There is time until the revocation."
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July was "the first time in history."He said, "It is essential that the United States, Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, collaborate in alliance relations."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damaged the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

It has been 30 days and 20 years since the critical accident that alarmed the safety myth of the nuclear industry.
According to the report, although the International Assessment Scale (INES), which shows seriousness, accounted for about 90% of the items that were not evaluated and not considered safe, it is necessary to raise safety awareness on the basis of lessons learned from the accident and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant of TEPCO in 11 years.
Mitsukazu Soda, who has completed the story and original drawings of creative picture books, is seeking donations for publication.
Koichi Soda (64), an artist from Echizen City Community Development Cooperation Corps in Fukui Prefecture, started a crowdfunding campaign aimed at publishing creative picture books inspired by legends in Fukui Prefecture in order to promote town development using picture books.

After working on the town development of Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi, he joined Echizen City in April this year.
The city, which produced Riko Kako and Chihiro IWASAKI, aims to create a town using picture books.
Mr. Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion surrounding me for the first time."
What attracted attention was the legend of the city of Awara, 'The face of the demon of the bride'.
It is a story that a gentle married woman continues to chant Nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) to help her mother without worrying about the fact that she was surprised by her face.
"I forgot my hatred, returned with kindness and kindness, and felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived, and made the story "Meoto Oni" that a loving couple and a boy appear.
From June, he drew 10 scenes with warm watercolors, taking advantage of his job, and the materials of picture books were scattered.
In addition, the cover of picture books will be made with washi using Echizen Washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
This leads to an opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the touch of Japanese paper by reading and listening.
In order to publish 600 copies, the goal of the donation amount is 850,000 yen.
The deadline is 25 October.
Mr. Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud throughout Japan.
I want to convey the true kindness and compassion that have been handed down to children through picture books."

i want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[Look at all images] Is the release date of macOS Catalina October 4?
The image above has been posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the character "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4.
On the official website, the accuracy of the information seems to be high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected that it is better with more perfection (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation of macOS.
Sakura shrimp in the growth process PT such as Shizuoka City, taken 290 meters deep | Shizuoka Shimbun at es
Sakura Ebi, born this year, has been successfully photographed in the deep sea of Suruga Bay.
The Yui Sakura Ebi Project, a project of the Ocean Industry Cluster Council led by industry, academia, and government officials in Shizuoka City, succeeded in photographing Sakura Ebi, which is believed to have been born during the spawning season this spring and summer, at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the concerned parties want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photograph was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1 to 5 km off the coast of Kamahara district, Shimizu Ward, the city.

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] World champion Kento Momoda and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, at the big event in badminton in August, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17th.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic Games from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the mid-game race (September to December).
The Badminton Olympics, which began in May, digested four of the top athletes (Super500 and above) at the end of the World Championships.
Two key players in the first half were Kento Momota, who won two of the four races, and Tensei (Cho Tien Cheng) of Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been contested by four groups: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/the result is 16 strong), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of top players is small, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championships were held, so fatigue would not be greater than during wartime.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
A strong Taiwanese ace.
Featured young Thai people!
Zhou Tiancheng, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
As a result, the player has a strong physical strength and does not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to earn high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and it became possible to maintain good results.
For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the finals at the top level, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the top 4 in the second round of this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who has become able to rally equal to the top player seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Planis B. has also taken a step forward in India, where he has a great selection of singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late for injury, will also be catching up in the future, so the Indian army after the midfield battle needs attention.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in response to the revision of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40 percent," and although expectations for price reduction increased, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry was postponed and the oligopoly status of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for their efforts.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts for terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half the price.
However, for 100 days, both companies have a SIM lock that can't be used by other companies.
NTT DOCOMO will use up to one third of the terminal cost for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies must respond promptly.
The postponement of Rakuten was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be an explosive in the price-cutting competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale service have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
This revision of the price triggered the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, and I do not think that it will be good."
However, the government-made price reduction does not seem to distort the market and promote sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and difficult to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount of advertising such as "maximum half price."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings.

The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from Izutsu-shitsu such as Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to Mutsu-shitsu following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI (former Sekiwaki-waki reboko).

There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & brawl Overseas ripples in "face-dangerous tackle" of U.S. players " insulting and cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
The FL Quill of the United States is a rough play, a former England national "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was the 26th edition of the tournament, with the United States losing 7-45 to England.
It began as a black star, but in the latter half of the year, Loughplay played by FL John Quill called for a ripple.
He leaves the scene with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insult and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of the face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the latter half of 29 minutes.
The English captain Farrell, deeply entrenched in the enemy's ranks, was somewhat in balance when he caught his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent come into contact, and it is shaped like a head thrust.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once and became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and left the field."
The article introduces the comments of former England international player and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked a single player in the game, managed to escape the loss in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced for the first time the names of 424 public hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, including Japan and the Red Cross, which judged that their medical records were poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare verified the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awa Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of Awa City, and Awa Hospital, and Awa Hospital, respectively.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, local chiefs and residents are expected to rebel against the fear that nearby hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 public and public hospitals that can respond to "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
The team analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
In the case of a hospital, it is necessary to consider abolishing or transferring some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare aims to reduce the number of beds in hospitals with 12.46 thousand beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds for "high-acute" and "acute" periods in which nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require high needs for elderly people.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical plan" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
The state is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing the issue, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) released on March 27 a proposal to revise the quarantine guidelines to prevent the spread of pork cholera, an infectious disease of domestic animals.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but distribution outside the meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (an open call for opinions), we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan's status as a clean country has been temporarily suspended.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "prevention zone" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed, and is confirmed by the ministry and allowed to use it at the governor's discretion.
Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga are the seven other prefectures that have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines have been revised, the region will look at the situation and decide extremely once again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excretions is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they practically accept distribution outside the region.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
He left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League last season, and Keisuke Honda, a former member of the Japan national team, has taken an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, said, "I don't need any money, but I need to play with a great team or a great teammate."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of the ongoing crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
Today, United is in a state of emergency, with injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip hard, challenging the quality of the front line.
Honda was named by the Australian media as a potential new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole Andreas Pereira fills."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward because of the veterans who have announced their goals for the Tokyo Olympics next year.

PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is the first time in Japan that the translators are deployed intensively in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60%.

now, don't you need to tie up the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shot is not necessarily tying up.
There is also the so-called "naodora" technique, where you want to hit a ball on the ground when you want to make a distance with a second hit of par 5 etc.
Recently, 1W has a high head volume, which poses a risk of scattering balls, but there are also players who practice this frequently on the ground.
It is Kansei Ikemura who is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, 24 years old is 166 cm in height, while he is currently 7th in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tiere, and sometimes a 1W is shaken.
In the case where big carry is required, the tip is often used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
He recorded between 270 and 280 yd with Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I am also happy to hear the exclamation from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a straight drag to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
The ball is not caught, and is at risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off (not bent to the left).
It is a professional technique that you can not help but say to Kantan.

A manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, first published in the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall
The author Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) obtained the manuscript of his essay "Shoku Bungei, Too Bungei," which he published in his last years, fighting literary theory with Junichiro TANIZAKI, by 27th at the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall in Kita Ward, Tokyo.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.

Twelve essays containing 200 characters were published in the April 27 issue of Bungei Shunju.
Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Swedish environmental activist Greta Toonberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September.
While the speech has attracted attention, there has been a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Political commentators on American television said Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing," and the television station that he used apologized.
In Japan, there are many online reports that comment on Greta's comments, such as "I feel sorry for being used" and "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
come up with all the lies and conspiracy theories you can think of.
Greta began writing, "You see, it started again, and as you realize, those who hate me are as active as ever, chasing around my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come up with far-reaching lies and conspiracy theories."
They pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but seem to be distracting from the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time would be able to do another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, a global climate change strike took place in New York and elsewhere.
Greta called on him to do it on Friday 27th.

[Video] Come to Japan!
Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with the momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter did not work well and could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there were still par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip in eagle came at #6.
It was a chance for Bardi to be caught in #7, but I regret that I couldn't reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so it was good that I could keep it firmly even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance was changed, so I did not have much (experienced) so I studied quite well.
what's the difference?
It seems that it was possible to take a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but quite a few people in the gallery were filming videos.
There were not many other changes, but since there were only a few Japanese players in co-hosting the tournament, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The latter half of the game will continue, but if you do not win more than one, you should not aim for the prize king, so I would like to win another one, and there is a ZOZO championship nearby, so I will try hard to get the qualification to enter the top in that tournament.
How do I prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting things"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with their research and development challenges.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be kept to the extent that it is extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I spoke to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepegil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have decreased due to drastic advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting
― Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is perceived as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, poverty becomes obese, and what you do is you have to look at TV vaguely, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation could be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books everyday, not metabolizing.
