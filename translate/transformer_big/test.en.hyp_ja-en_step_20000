It is dangerous to drive in Hyheel!
News of Yahoo!
violations of road traffic law
I think it's a big mistake, but it's a big mistake.

It is important to call attention as well as the young age layer.
do you take your feet?
do you take safety?
This data does not include gender ratios and causes, but the difference between the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflection nerves, may be a mistake due to other things such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as Heathle, panps, sandals, mulls and mulls.
Some people know that they are not suitable for driving, but they don't think about the possibility that they can lead to danger.
However, driving on high-heel and sandals is a mortgage on road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the handle, brake and other operations, "If you don't want to drive the accident to harm people," Article 70 of the "safe driving duty violation."
Another thing is that the driver must comply with the rules set forth by the Ministry of Public Safety and Regulations, for example, in Article 12 of the Department of Road Traffic Act of Miyazaki Prefecture, it is said that the driver must comply with the provisions specified by the Ministry of Land, Transport, etc.
In each prefecture, it is similar to the idea that it is a violation of the driving in the "wear that can prevent driving operations."
Why is driving in Heathle dangerous?
It is obvious that it is based on the basics of driving pedals safely.
For safe pedal operation, the first leg is fixed to the floor, and the feet are vertical to the brake pedal, and when you step on the accelerator pedal, you can tilt the leg to the right.
At this time, it is important to keep the vehicle's behavior firmly fixed, regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, it is difficult to adjust the fine adjustment, however, because the size of the ground is small and the size of the ground on the floor is always mixed with Gragra, and to have the angle of the entire leg at the height of Heel.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most of the cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull, and when it comes to a fast brake, there is no pedal that pulls the heel and the heel is pulled away, it can be removed from the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is a case where the heel pulls behind the pedal and the accelerator pedal is not returned.

Men's singles!
In August, he won six medals at the Badminton Big Events and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, and participated in the ChinaOP, which opened from 17th to early September.
Here, we are looking forward to seeing men's singles for the first half of the Olympic Games in Tokyo from May to August, while looking back to the first half of the tournament in Tokyo.
At the end of May, Badminton's Olympic Games took place at the top of the World Championship (Super 500).
In the first half of the tournament, he won the 4th tournament, and two of the Taiwan Tenshu (King and Tienchen).
Tanta won the World Championships, and Tensei won a high-point competition in Indonesia's OOP (S1000), which directly connects to the Olympic Games.
There are also other Japanese OOP (S750).
The tournament was held from May to May (May/China) by Indonesia OOP (July 16 strong) and JapanOP (7 July) in the World Championship (August).
There are little numbers compared to other top players, but it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, it was only the first World Championships in the World Championship, but it would not be much fatigue than the war.
In the middle of September, the high-level tournament is expected to be held in a row.
It has a strong victory in Taiwan.
Young people in Thailand!
In addition, he won the top prize in Indonesia's OOP and ThailandOP (S500).
He joined the local TaipeiOP (S300) in September and won the championship.
It was originally a heavyweight player who did not struggle.
There is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it is easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament to participate in the next year.
Until last year, Tensei had an impression that there was a lack of explosive power, but in this year it was able to continue his positive performance.
For the top ranking of the world rankings, it seems to be a big opponent than ever.
In addition to this two players, he left the results in the first half of the match, but in Thailand he was a young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cyclone B.
He is the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who is struggling as a European force.
Cantaphon is not able to enter the finals at the top of the tournament, but in the second season, he won the top prize.
There is still a rough side, but it is said that 20 years old (21 years old) could be rallying with top players and other players (21 years old) would have a great chance to leap in the Olympic Games.
In addition, Cy Praneys B.B. took a step in India with a single player.
It is necessary to pay attention to the Indian forces after the middle of the middle of the war, as well as the Surikans Ki Dambi, who has been delayed by injury.
The new cost of mobile phones: Hokkaido Newspapers How about the new electronic version
In October, the new charge plan of the mobile phone company led to the implementation of the revised telecommunications business law.
However, it was very high.
However, the price competition did not occur despite the expectations for the reduction of the value in the last summer.
It is a big factor that the full entry of Rakuten has become the destination, and the presence of three major companies continues.
For consumers, it is desirable that the price system is easy to use by fair competition.
We wanted to make efforts by mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount of terminal and communication fees.
Instead of selling the terminal, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to maximize the terminal.
However, for 100 days, the two companies are using SIM locks that are not used by other companies.
NTT Dokomo is a maximum of three-thirds of the terminal for only the company's contract.
The three companies also show that they continue to "outside" to prevent transfer from other companies.
For SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy that would require immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay of Rakuten was not due to the development of telecommunications networks such as the base station.
It was only expected to be an explosive agent in the competition.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
It is not clear when it comes to full-fledged service.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
The price was revised by the Minister of the Interior.
Mr. Suga said, "I think we're going to start competition in the future."
However, I don't think that the government's price reduction will help market and sound competition.
The company should continue to compete in the customer's ranking before the government exits.
The rate system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The consumer agency calls attention to the fact that the device has advertising such as "the maximum amount of up to half."
We need to make sure that companies are easy to understand and easy to understand, as they don't make mistakes.

Other 7 prefectures of Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga are held as recommendations for vaccination.
When the guidelines were revised, the situation is extremely determined.
In principle, migrations such as vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, bodies, and exhaustion are limited to the region.
For meat and processing products, they are not subject to the effects of the cost of distribution and the impact of farmers, and they are allowed to distribute them outside the area.

How to prevent dementia?
I'm going to talk and talk about it.
The major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenge the development and development of dementia.
However, it is understood that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated and there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital I heard about Professor Masasuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
There is a difference between the severity of Otsuki and the severity of the disease.
However, it is still thought that new dementia drugs are developed for more than 20 years.
The drug used in Japan has already been outside insurance adaptations in some countries overseas, and it is not possible to expect significant completion effects.
On the other hand, the deaths of infectious diseases and accidents decreased, and cancer deaths have been declining due to severe advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, patients with dementia are increasing.
It is not possible to solve your own or family, but it is necessary to create an environment that can live safely in the whole society.
how to keep it up
What are people who are prone to dementia?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to reduce the symptoms as much as possible as possible.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be easy to become.
First, metabols are likely to become dementia.
dementia is one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It affects whether or not economic power.
For example, in the U.S., there is a region that distributes food tickets to the poor, but food can be saved by food tickets is hamburg, pizza and chicken.
People who are living in a environment where they cannot use gas or electricity.
When it comes to a small diet of vegetables and protein, it becomes a living in lipids and sugar.
When it comes to poverty, it can only be seen on TV, but the body is disabled.
The similar situation can be Japan.
Other than that, people who don't think about things and do not work are prone to dementia.
In other words, it is necessary to consider things that are not metabolized by dementia.
