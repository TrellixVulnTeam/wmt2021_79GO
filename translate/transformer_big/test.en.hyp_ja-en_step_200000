Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo! News
Violations against road traffic laws
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading is increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, the number of accidents involving pedal treading errors by age (more than 1080 cases under 24 years old) exceeded 1032 cases over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
you want to take your feet off?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, young people may be inadvertently misled by other things such as music and conversation, or trampled errors due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pumps, sandals and mules, and some people drive as they are.
Although some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes, some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Law.
The first is "Consistent operation of steering wheel, brakes and other operations" Article 70 "Consistent violation of safety driving obligation" which stipulates that "Do not drive to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by each prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations, such as slippers, hanging, high heels."
Even if it is not specified as a high heel, the purpose of each prefecture is the same as to consider driving as a violation of " footwear that may interfere with driving operation."
Why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the heel does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs out, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal becomes smaller and it is difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be firmly trampled.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material can easily catch a high-heeled heel, and pedals cannot be stepped on when suddenly braking, or high-heel can be removed from the time signature when the heel is pulled, and it can be stuck in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., which manufactures "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the frequent damage caused by the earthquake that "consumer tile roofs were removed."
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code: 530173983; capital of 9.92 million yen; 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture; representative Yukizo Fukuhara; 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and one other attorney.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged with Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. to succeed the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., and at the same time, the head office was relocated to its present location after changing its present business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70%, and Ibushi-gawara was manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand for tiled roofs has been sluggish, and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to approximately 1.345 million yen.
In terms of profits, in addition to a decline in profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to carry out severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank tried to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, but there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and financial conditions were gradually tight.
He was unable to support the project and gave up on continuing the business.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs disappeared, and the Cubs' Darbish pitcher (33) who finished the pitch this season responded to the interview, saying "I have not done anything for two days, but it is hard to watch baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses and a defensive margin of 3 and 98.
Especially in the latter half of the war, the throwing form was stable and he continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball power.
"I was 33 years old and I didn't think it would be like that.In spring I thought, "I wonder if I'm going to end this way too," but I feel that I can't believe that I came back from there and went to a better place."
From around the beginning of June, I gradually got a response.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased, and the number of things we can do every day has increased."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that he had established one after another, his condition improved dramatically and his grades improved accordingly.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year.
Dalvish, who has the right to opt out of the contract after the end of this season, says, "I'm going to have to think about it, I'm going to talk to my agents and family."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling seems to be firm.

Nishida plays the head of the group that is strong but doesn't hate somewhere, and Nishijima plays Himura, who is the number 2 of the main group of Oki, who has always been choreographed by his parents.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I have been nervous until today."
"Not only during the shooting period, but also after the shooting, the members gathered frequently and were a very united team that talked about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was just a drinking party called a review meeting that didn't reflect on at all," "It was a positive thing for the site to make such a time, teamwork improved, motivation increased, it continued regularly after the end, there are lots of good memories," he said.
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Nishijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drink too much, I often do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he looks like a bereaved person," and "It looks like a silaf, but was drunk?It's really a good hangover"I was impressed and invited the laughter of the venue.
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, Nishida showed his willingness to "make a series if reputation is good, I would like to do my best to make a series with your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to make a series," Nakao said, "I was disappointed because Nishida was singing when I watched the movie.

With the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident at TEPCO, discussions on test operations that continue with fisheries off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture toward full-scale operations in each district and other areas became concrete.
Mr. Tetsu Nozaki, President of the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives, said, "As the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives in the prefecture, we need a flow toward full-scale operation, and we want the representatives to gather and start discussions."
The Union Presidents' Association also approved the formal addition of the fish species to the target species for test operations in the areas of Casago, Sakura Mas and Murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture where the restrictions on shipment were lifted.
The remaining undisclosed marine products were two fish species, Vinosgai and Common Cusbe.
At the end of the meeting, President Nozaki told reporters that the start of full-scale operations has not been decided.
In response to the water treatment after purifying contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, Mr. Yoshiaki Harada, former Minister of the Environment and Ichiro Matsui, Mayor of Osaka City, said, "The debate with a sense of kellenity is a problem, and the position against ocean emission remains unchanged."

beauty and ugliness?
The image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is the mysterious beauty and the expression of the shadow in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019, which focuses on beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Baizu, who is known as the leading figure of "The Fear Manga."
When I look at it with my hands, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Baizu's work again.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's works
In the preface of the Beauty Girl Collection, there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when they have the beauty of the opposite," but because of the contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of the grudge that dwells in the grudge ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many of the works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but snakes are perceived as " creepy creatures" by the viewer, and there are people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly" may be "snakes" of the living things in the front and back.
Also, this creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are plum paintings with the theme of "Snake" such as "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga Kowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
In an imaginative way, can I say that it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu works, but deep sleep every 100 years to keep eternal life and eternal youth, and the part with strange power is reminiscent of "snake."

There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "We needed a place where people could interact with each other.
It is a place of multi-generational exchange where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.

There are various places to offer meals every day from the 1st of May.
There are a wide variety of venues ranging from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere is getting ready for people who want to do it.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.

Even though it is kyoto, " values change by engaging with many people" "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It is like the light of hope in closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Ababir, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the crashed US military.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a cruising range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to catch radar because it flies low in the air." (Toru Yokota, a news photographer)
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran, under President Rouhani's leadership, is behind the Houthis faction, and Iran cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under circumstances where its own country cannot export crude oil; it aims to inform the international community if oil embargo continues to take place against Iran, accompanied by pains."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid military intervention at least until the end of next year's election, and Iran will continue to bomb the Hoosiers in hiding, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever, and there is enough chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's " proxy war" is in imminent danger.
That's why YouTuber became a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, some companies have started an unusual system called YouTuber adoption, which they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (Customer Relationship Management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary that actually adopted YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with youtuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter, Kobayashi): Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people admire.
It is also ranked in the career rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber adoption" aims to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers don't get the revenue they want.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation for the creators we hired.
At first, we will support the demerit of the profession called YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.
Environmental Girl: Fight for a Safe Future Protests around the world for two consecutive weeks | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA." - Yahoo!
U.S. Under-Secretary of the U.S. Under-Secretary of the U.S. Under-Secretary for South Korea and Japan, Mr. Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the United States in Tokyo, said on November 27 that he hoped that Korea would reconsider and return the decision to destroy Japan and Korea's comprehensive military information protection agreement
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to crises."
He strongly urged the return of Korea, saying, "There is time until revocation."
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July was the first time in history. He said, "It is essential that the United States, Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, collaborate in alliance relations."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damaged the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

Koichi Soda, who has completed the story and original drawings of the original picture book, is seeking donations for publication.
Koichi Soda (64), an artist in the Echizen City Regional Revitalization Cooperation Team in Fukui Prefecture, started a crowdfunding campaign aimed at publishing creative picture books inspired by legends in Fukui Prefecture in order to promote town development using picture books.
Mr. Soda, who was originally from Hokkaido and started his activities as a member of the cooperative group in April this year, says, "I want to convey the hearts of the people of Fukui based on deep faith through picture books."
[Donation is here] To convey the heart of Fukui.
While Mr. Soda is active as an artist working on contemporary art based on mathematics, he has also been active as a member of the cooperative team since the end of the calendar.
After working on the town development of Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi, he moved to Echizen City in April this year.
The city, which produced Riko Kako and Chihiro IWASAKI, aims to create a town using picture books.
Mr. Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion around me for the first time."
I focused on the legend of the city of Awara, 'The face of the demon of the bride'.
It is a story that a gentle married woman continues to chant Nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) to help her mother without worrying about the fact that she was surprised by her face.
"I forgot my hatred, returned with kindness and kindness, and felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived, and completed the story "Meoto Oni" where a loving couple and a boy appear.
From June, he drew 10 scenes with warm watercolors, taking advantage of his job, and the materials of picture books were scattered.
In addition, the cover of picture books will be made with washi using Echizen Washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
This leads to an opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the touch of Japanese paper by reading and listening.
The goal of the donation amount is 850,000 yen for 600 copies.
The deadline is 25 October.
Mr. Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud throughout Japan.
I want to tell children what true kindness and compassion are handed down through picture books."
Fukui Prefecture is one of the projects in which Fukui Prefecture certifies 11 projects for regional revitalization that are challenged by local cooperatives and businesses in the prefecture, and supports them by utilizing hometown tax.

When Crop finally asked a more personal question, he concluded, "When I blessed the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was, this time I didn't wake up, I didn't like to get drunk because I was suffering from the obsession of self-management.I remember everything, if I lined up everyone in front of me, I might be able to tell everyone from the bus."

i want to use Sidecar
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[Look at all images] Is the release date of macOS Catalina October 4th?
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the character "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4th.
The accuracy of the information is also high on the official website.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a subdisplay of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better with more completeness (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation of macOS.

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] world champion Kento Momoda and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, at the big event in badminton in August, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) which will open from the 17th.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic Games from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the middle race (September to December).
The Badminton Olympics, which began in May, digested four of the top athletes (Super500 and above) at the end of the World Championships.
Two key players in the first half of the competition were Kento Momoda, who won two of the four competitions, and Tensei (Cho Tien Cheng) of Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
The four competitions that have been held since May include the Sudirman Cup (May / China), the Indonesia OP (July / results are over 16), the Japan OP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Fewer than the other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was only one World Championship race, fatigue would not be greater than a series of wars.
A good result is required in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
A strong Taiwanese ace.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a very strong player and does not suffer from a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to earn high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and it became possible to continue the good performance firmly.
For Momota, who is the number one in the world ranking, it will be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the final in the top tournament, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the best 4 in the second tournament this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is able to rally against the top players has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Planis B. has also taken a step forward in India, where he has a great selection of singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who is late for injury, will also be catching up in the future, so the Indian forces after the midfield battle need attention.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in response to the revision of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40%," and although expectations for price reduction were rising, price competition did not occur.
Rakuten's full-scale entry was postponed, and the oligopoly state of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended law prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device a maximum of half the price.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" system that can not be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will charge up to one third of the terminal fee only for subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be an explosive in the price-cutting competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale service have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
The price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges for the three companies, saying, "I think the competition will start from now on, and I do not think that it will be fine."
However, the government-made price reduction does not distort the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
Each company's pricing system is very complex and difficult to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there were cases where the consumer's burden exceeded half the cost of advertising such as "maximum half price."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by themselves.
Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
The three shinkin banks in Mie Prefecture (the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, the Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they had decided to reduce their withdrawal limit by using cash cards to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank were lowered to Kihoku Shinkin Bank from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions, police officials, etc. and sent out at ATMs.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsurutatsu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI (former Sekiwaki Retroboko).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was born in Izutsu-shitsu and was a brother and son of Chikakata ITSUTSU.
On the 16th, Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the Kagamiyama room of the same family, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & brawl Overseas ripples in "face risk tackle" of U.S. players " insulting and cowardly play"- Yahoo!News
The FL Quill of the United States is a rough play, and the former England national team is "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was the last tournament in 20 countries to be played in the United States.
It began as a black star, but in the latter half of the year, Lafpley played by FL John Quill called for a ripple.
One shot leaves in the form of adding shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insult and a cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The real moment of the face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
At the height of the enemy's strength, the English captain Farrell was somewhat out of balance when catching his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent come into contact, and the shape is like pushing the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features headlines as "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, which left him."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked a single player in the game, managed to escape the loss in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced for the first time the names of 424 public hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, including Japan and the Red Cross, which were judged to have poor clinical experience.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awa Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of straw City, and Awa Hospital, and Awa Hospital, respectively.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety about the disappearance of familiar hospitals.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals covered was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "high acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
The team analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital should be considered to be closed or to transfer some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1,246 thousand beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds for "high-acute" and "acute" periods in which nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require high needs for elderly people.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and debates are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive drill for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road etc. Wide area with participation of residents, for the first time in 18 years (video): Hokkaido Shimbun

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) released on July 27 a proposal to revise the quarantine guidelines to prevent the spread of Ton cholera, an infectious disease in livestock, which is not currently recognized.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been confirmed to be infected.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but distribution outside the meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments (an open call for opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution of meat, etc., it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "prevention zone" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, how to proceed, etc., and will be confirmed by the ministry and approved by the governor.
Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga are the seven other prefectures that are recommended for vaccination.
When the guidelines have been revised, the region will look at the situation and decide extremely once again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excretions is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they effectively tolerate distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
A public approach to independent Keisuke Honda and Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
He left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League last season, and Keisuke Honda, a former member of the Japan National Team, has taken an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, made a public approach to a club: "Please give me an offer, I don't need money, but I need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of a crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
Today, United is in a state of emergency, with many injured, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses.
Honda was named by the Australian media as a candidate for a new force to enter the Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole Andreas Pereira fills."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward for the veterans who have announced their goals for the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce, shops, etc. | Shizuoka Shimbun at es
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCC) announced on February 26 that it has completed the installation of a total of 500 portable translation machine "PokeTalk" at its member offices for free.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator intensively in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60% of the population.
The map app "Google Map" also started to show where to rent it, so that you can see the location of "stores that are compatible with foreign languages" on your smartphone.
It can be accessed from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Poketok, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I would like you to develop new foreign customers in a difficult business environment."
right now, you don't need to tie up the first hit, right?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shots are not necessarily tying up.
There is also the so-called "naodora" technique of tapping a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of the par 5 etc.
Recently, 1W has a high head volume, which poses a risk of scattering the ball, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, 24 years old is 166 cm tall, but he is currently seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't want to shoot a spoon (3W) so I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tiere, and sometimes a 1W is shaken.
In the case where a big carry is required, a lot of tie-ups are used, but both sides are used effectively in a narrow hall.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
The ballistic instruments recorded 270 to 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
Surprised by our tour companions, we are also happy to hear the exclamation from the gallery we saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, you can't fly straight even if you hit the upper.If it's a cut track, you go to the right.I used to do a straight drag to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
The ball is not caught and is at risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off."
It's a professional skill that you can't think of.

GQ Men's 10 Day 9 Skateboarding with Friends - Yahoo!
The only way to move is by skateboarding!
I have been hooked since my friend invited me to slide.
I'm still a beginner, but it feels good to run through the asphalt with push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because it can be hands-free with smartphones, wallets and luggage.
With shorts, you can feel the wind directly and feel good.
Of course, it is light with Converse skateboard shoes.
Fashion and culture around skateboarding are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram carefully!
I also went to a salon run by a hairdresser of skaters in Yutenji.
I was inspired by the tricks I still can't do at all, the information about skateboard park and so on.
After school, our daily routine is to walk around the city with friends and skateboards.

[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Political commentators said on American television that Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing," and the television station that he used apologized.
In Japan, there are many online reports that comment on Greta's comments, such as "I feel sorry for being used" "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
come up with all the lies and conspiracy theories you can think of.
Greta began writing, "See, it started again, and as you realize, those who hate me are as active as ever, chasing around my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come up with far-reaching lies and conspiracy theories."
The adults pointed out that they did not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seemed to be questioning the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't spend your time paying more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
Whether adults like that change or not.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, there were strikes on climate change in New York and other parts of the world.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with the momentum in the second half, but I was disappointed because the seater was not good enough and I could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there were still par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip in eagle came at #6.
It was a chance for Bardi to be caught in #7, but I regret not being able to reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I could keep it firmly even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance changed, so I did not have much (experienced) so I studied quite well.
What is the difference?
It was possible to take a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
There were not many other things that changed, but there were only a few Japanese players in the competition jointly, so I went to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
The second half of the race will continue from now on, but if you do not win more than one, you should not aim for the prize king, so I want to win another one, and there is a ZOZO championship nearby, so I will try hard to get the qualification to enter the top in that tournament.
How do I prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I spoke to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have decreased due to drastic advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
how to keep it to the level of forgetting
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be stored.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
Eventually, poverty becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can only vaguely watch TV, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation could be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books from day to day.
