Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving incorrect pedals by young people - Yahoo!
Violations in violation of the Road Traffic Act
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading has been increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 pedal misstep accidents occurred at the age of 24 and over 1032.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet off?
is it safe?
There is no description of gender ratio or cause in this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is also a possibility that young people are inadvertently misled by other things such as music and conversation, and tram mistakes due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pumps, sandals and mules, and some people drive as they are.
Some people say that it is troublesome to change shoes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.
The first is "Reliable operation of steering wheel, brake and other operations" Article 70 "Contrary to safety driving obligations" which stipulates that "Do not drive in such a way as to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the respective prefectural public safety committees, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, for example, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations, such as shoes, slippers, hanging, high heels, etc."
Even if it is not specified as a high heel, the purpose of each prefecture is the same as to regard driving as a violation of " footwear that may interfere with driving operation."
Why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the heel does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs and blurs, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot where the pedal is ground is also smaller, and it is difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be stepped firmly.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch a high heel or heel, and in case of sudden braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be stepped, or the high heel is removed in the time signature that the heel is pulled, and it can not be stepped by pinching the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

The previous Obama administration set the maximum limit for fiscal 2017 to 110,000, but the Trump administration, which was inaugurated in January 1717, reversed this and reduced it to 50,000.
The number continued to decrease year by year to 45,000 in FY18 and 30,000 in FY19.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer tile roofing away" due to repeated damage from the earthquake.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code:53173983; capital of 9.92 million yen; 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture; representative Yukizo Fukuhara; 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and one other person.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tile, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (now Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd., succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., and at the same time, the head office was relocated to its present location after changing its present trade name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70%, and Ibushi-gawara was manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, the demand for tiled roofs has been sluggish, and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to approximately 1.345 million yen.
In terms of profits, in addition to a decline in profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to carry out severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank tried to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, but there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and funding gradually became tight.
I couldn't help but gave up on business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

The city also plans to build a parking lot.
Some members called for speed-up when the maintenance schedule was slow, and others said that there was no place to sleep.

The first day of the performance of "Ninkyo Gakuen"
This work is a painful story in which Yakuza and the head of the Tokimoto group, who are not interested in contributing to society, undertake the reconstruction of high school on the verge of bankruptcy, and solve many difficult problems with Giri Ninjo.
Nishida plays the head of the group that is strong but doesn't hate somewhere, and Nishijima plays Himura, who is the number 2 of the Tokimoto group that has always been choreographed by his parents.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I have been nervous until today."
"Not only during the shooting period, but also after the shooting, the members gathered all the time and were so united that they talked about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was a review meeting, just a drinking party that didn't reflect on at all," "It was a positive thing for the site to make such a time, team work became better and motivation increased.Even after the end, it continued regularly and there are lots of good memories," he said.
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Nishijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drank too much, often I do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he is indecent," and "It looks like a silaf, but I was drunk?It's really a good hangover."
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to "make it a series if reputation is good."I would like to work hard for the series by borrowing your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to make it a series," Nakao said, "I would like to sing this time after watching the movie."

With the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident at TEPCO, discussions for full-scale operation of test operations off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture were made in each district.
Mr. Tetsu Nozaki, President of the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives of the prefecture, said, "As the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives of the prefecture, we believe that the flow toward full-scale operation is necessary, and we hope that the representatives will gather and start discussions."
The Union Presidents' Association also approved the official addition of casago, sakura trout, and murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture to the target species for test operations.
The remaining undisclosed marine products were two fish species, Vinosgai and Common Cusbe.
At the end of the meeting, President Nozaki told reporters that the start of full-scale operations has not yet been decided.

beauty and ugliness?
"Snake" image overlaps with beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is the mysterious beauty and the expression of the shadow in common?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent out to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I look at it with my hands, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Baizu's work again.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Kazuo Bai painting
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of these women who are at the opposite end."
There is a keyword "snake" in what appears many in Baizu Kazuo's work, but snakes are perceived as "spicy creatures" by the viewer, and there are people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensibilities of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "snakes" of the living things in the front and back.
Also, this creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga Kowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the common point of beauty girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu works, but in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, and the part with strange power somehow reminiscent of "snake."

The number increased by one to six times compared to 2018, and there were 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by nine compared to last year.
why is it now?
Makoto Yuasa, chairman of the Kyoto NPO and social activist, spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely, and shopping streets declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So, he said, "We needed a place where people could interact with each other.
It is a place of multi-generational exchange where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
what's important is not to create children from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day from January 1 to March 1.
There are a wide variety of venues ranging from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere is getting ready for people who want to do it.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes we hear about issues like a secure management system
"Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo!News
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Ababir" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the US military that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a cruising range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to get caught by radar because it flies low." (Toru Yokota, a news photographer)
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran, led by President Rouhani, is behind the Houthis faction, and it cannot be tolerated that Saudi Arabia, which is hostile to Iran, is making crude oil in a situation where its own country is unable to export crude oil, aims to inform the international community that if the embargo of crude oil continues to take place against Iran, it will suffer accordingly."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's election, I would like to avoid military intervention, knowing that Iran will continue to bomb the Hoosiers with drones, but the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever, and there is sufficient possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's " proxy war" is in imminent danger.
The reason YouTuber became a full-time employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, some companies have started a unique system called "YouTuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (Customer Relationship Management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary of YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with youtuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people admire.
It is also ranked in the career rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber adoption" aims to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers can't afford the revenue they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation for creators hired.
At first, we will support activities by supporting the disadvantage of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.
Environmental Girl "Challenge a Safe Future" Protests worldwide for two consecutive weeks | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
On the 27th, Greta Thunberg (center) and others (Router-Joint) participated in a protest in Montreal, eastern Canada.
New York co-host Greta Thunberg (16), a Swedish girl who advocates measures against global warming, participated in a protest in Montreal, eastern Canada on the 27th and emphasized that she will continue to fight for a safe future.
Young people protested on this day, following Asian countries, in Europe and the United States.
The large-scale protest in response to Greta's call lasted two weeks, following 20 days.

"I hope South Korea will return to GSOMIA." - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 27 that he hoped that Korea would reconsider and return to its decision to destroy Japan and Korea's comprehensive military information protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23.
It is unusual for a senior U.S. official to mention a reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
South Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan in August, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse in Japan and South Korea.
Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to crises."
He strongly urged the return of Korea, saying, "There is time until revocation."
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan was "the first time in history" and said, "It is essential that the United States, Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, collaborate in alliance relations."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damaged the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

When Crop finally asked a more personal question, "When I congratulated the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and I didn't even know where I was, this time I didn't wake up, I don't like to get drunk because I'm a man suffering from the obsession of self-management.I remember everything.If I put everyone in front of me, I might be able to tell everyone from the bus."

i want to use Sidecar
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[View all images] Is the release date of macOS Catalina October 4?
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has a letter "from October 4th (fra den 4. oktober) ."
The accuracy of the information is also high on the official website.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a subdisplay of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better with more perfection (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation macOS.

The video of the growth process is valuable, and the concerned parties want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photograph was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1 to 5 km off the coast of the Kamahara district, Shimizu Ward, the city.
A total of 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.
In the daytime, the conventional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea form a certain group at the bottom of the sea was reaffirmed.
The adult body is about 40 mm long and the individual reflected is about 23 mm long.
The spawning period was determined by matching the seasonal data of the caught shrimp.
Detailed analysis is requested by Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Technical College, which make up the team.
Keisuke Mizuno, Project Leader, said, "I want to capture the living figure of individuals in the growth process, including fry."

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] World champion Kento Momoda, and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, at the big event in badminton in August, finished the training camp in early September and participated in the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17th.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic race from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the middle race (September to December).
The Badminton Olympics, which began in May, digested the top four events (Super 500 and above) that were played by top athletes at the end of the World Championship.
Two key players in the first half were Kento Momoda, who won 2 of the 4 races, and Tensei (Cho Tien Cheng) in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also won the Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been held in four groups: the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/Result of 16), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of top players is small, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championships were held, so fatigue would not be greater than during the war.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
A strong Taiwanese ace.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
As a result, the player has a strong physical strength and does not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to earn high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and it became possible to continue the good performance firmly.
For Momota, who is the number one in the world ranking, it will be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the final at the top level, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the best 4 at the second round of this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is now able to rally against the top players can be said to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Planis B. has also taken a step forward in India, where he has a great selection of singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who are late for injury, are also catching up in the future, so the Indian forces after the midfield battle need to be careful.
New charges for mobile phones Reduce prices with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in response to the revision of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40%," and although expectations for price reduction were increasing, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market has been postponed and the oligopoly status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, it was set to be expensive.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half the price.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will charge up to one third of the terminal fee only for subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy requiring immediate termination.
Companies must respond promptly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be an explosive in the price reduction competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale service have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
The price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees for the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's going to be good."
However, it is unlikely that the government-made price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complicated and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there were cases where the consumer's burden exceeded half the cost of advertising such as "maximum half price."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by users themselves.
Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they have decided to reduce their withdrawal limit using cash cards to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
The Sanju Shinkin Bank of Kuwana and the Ueno Shinkin Bank of Kita-Ise will be lowered from October 1 and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions, police officials, etc. and sent out at ATMs.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from Izutsu-shitsu, including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI, and one sumo wrestler from Tokoyama, to Mutsu-shitsu, following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki Reverse Hoko).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was from the Izutsu room and was a brother and son of the late Izutsu Chikakata.
On the 16th, Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the Kagamiyama room of the same family, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & brawl Overseas ripples in "face risk tackle" of U.S. players " insulting and cowardly play"- Yahoo!News
The U.S. FL Quill played rough, and the former England national team "It's not called tackle."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was the 26th edition of the tournament, and the United States, the last to appear in 20 countries, lost 7-45 to England.
It began as a black star, but Lafplay, played by FL John Quill in the latter half, called the ripple.
One shot leaves in the form of adding shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players complained that it was "an insulting and vulgar play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insulting and vulgar play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of "face danger tackle" played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the latter half of 29 minutes.
At the height of the enemy's strength, the English captain Farrell was somewhat out of balance when catching his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent come into contact, and it is shaped like a head thrust.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against the play, apparently lacking legitimacy, to fly Quill.
Both players gathered at once and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some fans asked for a fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, which left him."
The article introduces the comments of former England international player and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked a single player in the game, managed to escape the loss in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 public hospitals in 1455 public hospitals nationwide and public hospitals such as Japan Red Cross, which determined that "the medical record is poor."
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awa Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of the city, and Awa Hospital, and Awa Hospital, respectively.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals close to them will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
We analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the necessity of publicizing the hospital name.
The hospital should be considered to be abolished and some departments transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1,246 thousand beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high-acute" and "acute" periods in which nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are taken, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly necessary for the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive drill for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road etc. Wide area with participation of residents, for the first time in 18 years (video): Hokkaido Shimbun
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people attended the event, including officials and residents of 20 institutions, including roads and three towns.
This was the first time since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It has been 18 years since the local residents participated in extensive training.
It is assumed that Mt.Komagatake erupted at 8:45 a.m. and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in both Mori and Nanae towns, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.
100,000 students protest against school holidays against global warming - Yahoo!News
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall across the Canby Bridge to the downtown library.
A few hours before the start of the meeting, people with placards began to gather in front of the city hall.
The number of participants continued to increase and eventually over 100,000 people participated.
On the road along the way, the police also cooperated with the road regulation and watched for hours until all people finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York, the city of Vancouver has held many events to think about global warming since last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school on this day complained to adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I take a break from the school," and many adults who took part in the work off responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) released on March 27 a proposal to revise the quarantine guidelines that enable preventive vaccination against domestic pigs, which are not currently recognized, in order to prevent the spread of pork cholera.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but distribution outside the meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments (an open call for opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "vaccination recommended area" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, how to proceed, etc.
Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga are the seven other prefectures that have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and make decisions extremely once again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excretions is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they effectively tolerate distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs, and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The draft amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, a public approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and Keisuke Honda, a former member of the Japan National Team, has taken an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, said, "Please give me an offer, I don't need money, but I need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of the ongoing crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
Today, United is in a state of emergency, with many injured, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip hard, challenging the quality of the front line.
As a result, the Australian media named Honda as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole Andreas Pereira fills."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get a full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward for veterans who are openly saying that they will be participating in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Complete installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and other stores | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that is freely loaned to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCC) announced on June 26 that it has completed the installation of 500 portable translation machine "PokeTalk" at its member offices for free.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator intensively in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60% of the population.
The map app "Google Map" also started to show the location of "stores that are compatible with foreign languages" on smartphones.
It is accessible from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Poketalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I would like to develop new foreign customers in a difficult business environment."
right now, ikemura hiroyo, a master of jidora, doesn't need tiUP for the first shot?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shots are not necessarily tying up.
There is also the so-called "naodora" technique, where you can hit a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of par 5.
In recent years, 1W has a high head volume and there is a risk that the ball will scatter, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
It is Kansei Ikemura who is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, he is 166 cm tall and small, but currently ranks seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tiere, and occasionally a 1W is shaken.
In the case where a big carry is required, the tip is often used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
The ballistic instruments recorded 270 to 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I am also happy to hear the exclamation from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit it on the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, you go to the right.I was originally doing a straight drum to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
The ball is not caught, and the risk of slice is associated with "so the left side can be turned off (not bent to the left) ."
It is a professional technique that makes you feel involuntary.

I'm still a beginner, but it feels good to run through the asphalt with push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because it can be hands-free with smartphones, wallets and luggage.
With shorts, you can feel the wind directly and feel good.
Of course, it is light with Converse skateboard shoes.
Fashion and culture around skateboarding are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram carefully!

come up with all the lies and conspiracy theories you can think of.
Greta started writing, "You see, it started again, and as you realize, those who hate me are still active, chasing around my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come up with all the possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but seem to be distracting from the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I wonder if they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I was disappointed because the seater was not good enough and I could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there were still par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip in eagle came at #6.
I was able to get a chance at the 7th, but I was disappointed that I couldn't reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I could keep it firmly even on a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance between the punches changed, so I did not have much (experienced) so I learned quite a lot.
What is the difference?
It was possible to take a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but quite a few people in the gallery were filming videos.
There were not many other things that changed, but there were only a few Japanese players in the competition jointly, so I went to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the game will continue from now on, but if you do not win more than one, you should not aim for the prize king, so I want to win another one, and there is a ZOZO championship nearby, so I will try hard to get the qualification to enter the top in that tournament.
How do I prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting things"?
Interview: Yo WATANABE
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I spoke to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have decreased due to drastic advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting
― Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people with metabolic syndrome tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
The presence or absence of economic power is also affected.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, it is poverty but becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can only vaguely see TV, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation could be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books everyday, not metabolizing.
