Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving incorrect pedaling of young people - Yahoo!
Violations in violation of the Road Traffic Act
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading has been increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 pedal misstep accidents occurred at the age of 24 and over 1032.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to mistake inadvertently due to other things such as music and conversation, and trampling due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on their day's clothing, such as high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules, and some drive as they are.
Although some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change shoes, some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.
The first is "Reliable operation of steering wheel, brake and other operations" Article 70 "Contrary to safety driving obligations" which stipulates that "Do not drive in such a way that causes accidents and harms people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by each prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, for example, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations."
Even if it is not specified as a high heel, the purpose of each prefecture is similar to that of regard as a violation of driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation."
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the heel does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the heels are grounded on the floor is small, and the heels always blur and blur.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch a high heel or heel, and sometimes when the heel is caught and the pedal cannot be stepped in, or when the heel is pulled, the high heel can be removed and stuck in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is a case where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer tile roofing away" due to repeated damage from the earthquake.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code: 530173983, capitalized 9.92 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-bankruptcy at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and one other attorney.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (now Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd., succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., and at the same time, the head office was moved to its present location after changing its present trade name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70% and Ibushi-gawara was manufactured at 30%.
The company has built a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand was sluggish due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, which caused consumers to leave their roofs.
On the profit side, in addition to a decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to carry out severe financing.
For this reason, although the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and funding gradually became tight.
I couldn't help but give up on business continuity and this is the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs disappeared, and Darvish pitcher (33) of the Cubs, who finished the pitch this season, told the interview, "I have not done anything for two days, but it is difficult to watch baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses and a defensive margin of 3 and 98.
Especially in the second half of the game, the pitch form stabilized and continued to play with the opponent with outstanding braking force and overwhelming ball power.
"I was 33 years old and I didn't think it would be like that.In spring I thought, "I wonder if I'm going to end this way too," but when I came back from there, I felt like I could not believe that I was able to go to a better place."
From around early June, I was able to respond gradually.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased, and the number of things we can do every day has increased."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that he had established one after another, his condition was greatly improved and his grades improved accordingly.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without being listed as injured throughout the year.
Dalvish, who has the right to opt out of the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it now, I'm going to talk to my agents and my family."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling seems to be firm.

On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I have been nervous until today."
"Not only during the shooting period, but also after the filming ended, the members gathered all the time and were so united that they talked about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was a review meeting, just a drinking party that didn't reflect on at all," and "It was a plus for the site to make such a time.The teamwork got better and motivation increased.Even after the end, it continued regularly, and there are lots of good memories."
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Nishijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drink too much, often I do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he's behaving, but I don't know who he is."I was impressed that he looked like a slav, but was drunk?
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to "make it a series if reputation is good, I would like to do my best to make it a series with your power," Ito said, "We also want to do our best to make it a series," Nakao said, "We were disappointed because Nishida sang when we watched the movie.
Prefectural Fishery Federation "Start discussion toward full-scale operation" Chairman Nozaki "Iwaki Minpo Official Website"
Following the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, discussions aimed at full-scale operation of test operations in each district and other areas regarding the continued operation of fisheries off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture became concrete.
Mr. Tetsu Nozaki, President of the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives of the prefecture, said, "As the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives of the prefecture, we need a flow toward full-scale operation, and we want the representatives to gather and start discussions."
The Union Presidents' Association also approved the formal addition of the fish species to the target species for test operations in the areas of Casago, Sakura Mas and Murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, where shipping restrictions were lifted.
The remaining undisclosed marine products were the two species of binosgai and common caste.
At the end of the meeting, President Nozaki told reporters that the start of full-scale operations has not yet been decided.
In response to the water treatment after purifying contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, he said, "The debate with a sense of kellenity is a problem, and the position against the release of the ocean remains unchanged."
In discussing the full-scale operation, Akira EGAWA, head of Iwaki City Fisheries Cooperative, pointed out that "it is necessary to suck up opinions from the bottom," and said that it respects the intentions of members.

beauty and ugliness?
The image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is the mysterious beauty and the expression of the shadow in common?
A number of works have been released since the 1950s, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) which focuses on beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Baizu, who is known as the leading figure of "The Fear Manga," was released in August 2019.
When I look at it with my hands, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Baizu's work again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's works
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when they have the beauty of the opposite," but because of the contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of resentment that dwells in vengeance ...
There is a keyword "snake" in the works that appear many in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensibilities of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be "snakes" of creatures that are united in the front and back.
In addition, this creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga Kowai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu works, but in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, and the part with strange power somehow reminiscent of "snake."

According to research conducted by NPOs and other organizations, there are approximately 3,700 locations nationwide this year.
The number increased by one to six times compared to 2018, and there were 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by nine compared to last year.
why is it now?
Makoto Yuasa, chairman of the Kyoto NPO and social activist, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "We needed a place where people could interact with each other.
Even though it is called "Kyoko-shokudo," it is a place for multi-generational exchanges that elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
what's important is not to create children from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day from January 1 to March 1.
There are a wide variety of venues ranging from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere is getting ready for people who want to do it.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes we hear about issues like a secure management system
"Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It is like the light of hope in closed society.

[Image] New 8 models of "Air Force 1" including NBA collaboration and models equipped with "Goretex" appeared at once
The Air Force 1 NBA Pack, in collaboration with the NBA, appeared in two types: low-cut and high-cut.
The low-cut is based on the NBA's red, yellow, black, and navy colors, while the high-cut is based on three teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers.
In addition to the NBA logo on heels and shoetans, satin fabric is used in the back of the upper, and the wash is the first bi-color design.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Ababir, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from the crashed US military.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to get caught by radar because it flies low in the air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Shortly after, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Houthis faction, under President Rouhani's leadership, that the hostile Saudis are making crude oil in a situation where they cannot export crude oil, and that if they continue to embargo crude oil against Iran, they will be informed by the international community that the pain in response will be accompanied."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some people say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's election, I would like to avoid any military intervention, knowing that Iran will continue to bomb the Hoosiers with drones, but the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever, and there is enough chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" is in imminent danger.
This is why YouTuber has become a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
Friday, September 27, 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, some companies have started an unusual system called "YouTuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (Customer Relationship Management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Dr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary of YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with youtuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people admire.
It is also ranked in the top job rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber adoption" aims to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
― There is an image that YouTuber is something that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to adopt it?
Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber can't earn as much as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we hired.
At first, we will support activities by supporting the demerit of the profession called YouTuber which inevitably becomes unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 27 that "Korea hopes to reconsider and come back to the decision to destroy Japan and Korea's comprehensive military information protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23."
It is unusual for a high-ranking U.S. official to mention a reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
"There is time until the revocation," he strongly urged the return of Korea.
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan was "the first time in history" and stressed that "it is essential that the United States, Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, collaborate in alliance relations."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damaged the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

Tokaimura Critical Accident, 20 years in 30 days, 300 nuclear facility troubles: Hokkaido Shimbun
According to an interview with the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), 336 cases of accidents and failures at nuclear facilities across Japan were reported from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2006 following the critical accident in Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture, the first in Japan's history of nuclear power.
It has been 30 days and 20 years since the critical accident that alarmed the safety myth of the nuclear industry.
According to the report, although the level 0 (non-safety critical) and non-assessment issues accounted for about 90% of the respondents who reported seriousness, it is necessary to continuously raise safety awareness based on lessons learned from the accident and the accident at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011.
Koichi Soda, who has completed the story and original drawings of creative picture books, is seeking donations for publication.
Koichi Soda (64), an artist from the Echizen City Regional Development Cooperation Volunteer in Fukui Prefecture, started a crowdfunding campaign aimed at publishing creative picture books inspired by legends in Fukui Prefecture in order to promote town development using picture books.
Mr. Soda, who was originally from Hokkaido and started his activities as a member of the cooperative group in April this year, says, "I want to convey the hearts of the people of Fukui based on deep faith through picture books."
[Donation is here] To convey the heart of Fukui.
While Mr. Soda is active as an artist working on contemporary art based on mathematics, he has also been active as a member of the cooperative team since the end of the calendar.
After working on the town development of Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi, he joined Echizen City in April this year.
In the same city that produced Riko Kako and Chihiro Iwasaki, he aims to create a town that makes use of picture books.
Mr. Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion I could understand for the first time."
What attracted attention was the legend of Awara City, "The face of the demon of the bride Odoshi."
It is a story that a gentle-hearted bride continues to chant Nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) to help her mother without worrying about the fact that she was surprised by the face of an ogre.
"I forgot my hatred and returned with kindness and kindness, and I felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived to complete the story "Meoto Oni" where a loving couple of demons and a boy appear.
From June, he drew 10 scenes with warm watercolors, taking advantage of his job, and the materials of picture books were scattered.
In addition, the cover of the picture book will be made with washi using Echizen washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
This leads to an opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the touch of washi through reading and listening.
The goal of the donation is 850,000 yen for 600 copies.
The deadline is 25 October.
Mr. Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud throughout Japan.
I want to tell children what true kindness and compassion have been handed down through picture books."
It is one of the projects that Fukui Prefecture certifies 11 projects for regional revitalization that are challenged by local cooperatives and businesses in the prefecture, and supports using hometown tax.
The Bank of Japan (Fukui Shimbun) provides information, and the Bank of Fukui cooperates with management support.
Donations can be made from the crowdfunding website Lady For.

Coats have been sold since early September, a month earlier than usual, and sales this month are said to have increased by 10% compared to the previous year.
A company employee (19) who visited Kurashiki store (Shiraraku-cho, Kurashiki City) to buy a suit for an adult ceremony said, "The ceremony is still ahead, but I want to buy it before tax increases."
In this tax increase, the tax rate for food and drink is set under the reduced tax rate system, so at home centers and supermarkets, we will focus on daily necessities and sake.

Finally received a more personal question, Crop concludes, "When I congratulated the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was, this time it didn't happen, I don't like to get drunk because I'm a man suffering from the obsession of self-management.I remember everything, if I put everyone in front of me, I might be able to tell everyone from the bus."

i want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[Look at all images] Is the release date of macOS Catalina October 4?
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has the character "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4th.
On the official website, the accuracy of the information seems to be high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a subdisplay of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better with more perfection (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next generation macOS fully.

In the daytime, the conventional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea form a certain group at the bottom of the sea was reestablished.
The adult body is about 40 mm long and the individual reflected is about 23 mm long.
The spawning period was identified by collating with seasonal data of freshly caught sakura shrimp.
Detailed analysis is requested by Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Technical College, which comprise the team.
Keisuke Mizuno, Project Leader, said, "I want to capture the living figure of individuals in the growth process, including fry."

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] World champion Kento Momoda and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, at the big event in badminton in August, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17th.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic race between May and August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the middle race (September to December).
The Badminton Olympic Games, which began in May, culminated in four of the world's top athletes competing in the Super 500 and above.
In the first half of the competition, the two players were Kento Momota, who won 2 of the 4 races, and Tensei (Cho Tien Cheng) of Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
The tournament has been held since May, including the Sudirman Cup (May in China), the Indonesia OP (July in Indonesia), the Japan OP (July in Japan), and the World Championships (August in Japan).
Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championships were held, so fatigue would not be greater than during the war.
It is expected that the best results will be obtained in the mid-term battle in which the top tournaments since September will continue.
A strong Taiwanese ace.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
As a result, the player has a strong physical strength and does not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to score high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and it became possible to continue the good performance firmly.
For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world ranking, it seems to be a more troublesome opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone as a European, is the three players.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the final at the top level, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the best 4 at the second round of this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who has become able to rally on equal terms with top players has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranice B. has also taken a step out of India, where singles have good players.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who are late due to injury, will be catching up in the future, so the Indian army after the midfield battle needs attention.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in response to the revision of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40 percent," and despite high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market was postponed, and the oligopoly state of the three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of cheaply selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to increase the number of devices to half.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will charge up to one third of the terminal fee only for subscribers of its own line.
It seems that the three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies must respond promptly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be an explosive in the price reduction competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
The price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I do not think that it will be fine."
However, the government-made price reduction does not seem to distort the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they are told by the government.
Each company's fee system is very complex and difficult to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called for attention as there were cases where the consumer's burden exceeded the half price even though the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price."
Companies should make careful and easy-to-understand explanations so as not to mislead users themselves.
Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they have decided to reduce their withdrawal limit by using cash cards to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank were lowered, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank was lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which financial institutions, police officials, etc. fake cash cards and PIN numbers and are sent out at ATMs.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNA | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was born in Izutsu's room and was a brother and son of Chikakata IZUTSU.
On the 16th, Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the Kagamiyama room of the same family, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & brawl "Face Danger Tuckle" of American players overseas ripple "Following and vulgar play"- Yahoo!News
U.S. F. Quill played rough, and he was a former England national "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was held on the 26th, with the United States losing 7-45 to England.
It began as a black star, but in the latter half of the film, Lafplay, played by FL John Quill, called for a ripple.
One shot leaves in the form of adding shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene was also released by overseas media with video, and former English players complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insulting and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of "face danger tackle" played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply entrenched in the enemy's field, was somewhat in balance when he caught his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent come into contact, and it is shaped like a head thrust.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against the play, apparently lacking legitimacy, to push Quill.
Both players gathered at once and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some fans asked for a fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, which left him."
The article introduces the comments of former England international and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's an insult, it's a coward, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked a single player in the game, managed to escape the loss in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced for the first time the names of 424 public hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, including Japan and the Red Cross, which judged that their medical records were poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awa Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of Awa City, and Awa Hospital, respectively.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization: standards are wrong
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that nearby hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was higher in Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
We analyzed nine medical records such as cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the necessity of publicizing the hospital name.
The hospital should be considered to be abolished and some departments should be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare aims to reduce the number of beds in hospitals with 1,246,000 beds (18 years) to 119,11,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high-acute" and "acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require high needs for elderly people.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, municipalities and medical officials are discussing it, many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive drill for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road, wide area with participation of residents for the first time in 18 years (video): Hokkaido Shimbun
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people attended the event, including officials and residents of 20 institutions including roads and three towns.
It was held for the first time since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It has been 18 years since the local residents participated in extensive training.
It is assumed that Mt. Komagatake erupted at 8:45 a.m. and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the level of volcanic alert was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in Mori and Nanae towns, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.
100,000 students protest against school holidays against global warming - Yahoo!
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall across Canby Bridge to the downtown library.
A few hours before the start of the meeting, people with placards began to gather in front of the city hall.
More than 100,000 people attended the event.
The police also cooperated with the police on the road along the way, keeping watch over all the people for hours.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York, the city of Vancouver has held many events to consider global warming since last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school on this day complained to adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I take a break from the school," and many adults who took part in the work off responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously studying."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) released on July 27 a proposal to revise the quarantine guidelines to prevent the spread of the infection of Ton cholera, an infectious disease of livestock.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but distribution outside the meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (an open call for opinions), we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has temporarily suspended its status as a pure country.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "Vaccination Recommended Area" based on experts' opinions regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The prefecture in question creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, how to proceed, etc.
Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga are the seven other prefectures that are recommended for vaccination.
When the guidelines have been revised, the region will review the situation and make decisions extremely once again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, excretions, etc. is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they effectively tolerate distribution outside the region.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The draft amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, we will conduct opinion inquiries and public comments to prefectures until October 7 and implement new quarantine guidelines.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, a public approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat.) 2:57
Last season, he left the Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and Keisuke Honda, an unaffiliated former Japan national team, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, approached a club with a public approach: "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could grab in the midst of a crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up to win the game.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
Today, United is in a state of emergency, with many injured, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to make a tough run in the league with 22 wins and 22 losses.
As a result, the Australian media named Honda as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole Andreas Pereira fills."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward for the veterans who announce their goals for the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce, shops, etc. | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that is freely loaned to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCC) announced on June 26 that it has completed the installation of 500 portable translation machine "PokeTalk" at its member offices for free.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator intensively in the same region, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" also started to show the location of "stores for foreign languages" on smartphones.
It can be accessed from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Poketok, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
A representative from the Chamber of Commerce said, "I would like you to develop new foreign customers in a difficult business environment."
right now, ikemura hiroyo, a famous nadora, doesn't need a tipup for the first shot?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shot is not necessarily a tie-up.
There is also the so-called "naodora" technique where you hit a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of par 5 etc.
In recent years, 1W has the risk of scattering balls due to its large head volume, but some players practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, he is 166 cm tall and small, but currently ranks seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tiere, and sometimes a 1W is shaken.
In the case where big carry is required, the tip is often used, but both sides make effective use of Naodora in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
The ballistic instruments recorded between 270 and 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I am also happy to hear the exclamation from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, you can't fly straight even if you hit it on the upper.If it's a cut track, you go to the right.I was originally doing a straight drag to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
If the ball is not caught, it is at risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off" .
It is a professional technique that you can not think of.

I have been hooked since my friend invited me to slide.
I am still a beginner, but it feels good if I run through the asphalt with push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because it can be hands-free with smartphones, wallets and luggage.
With shorts, you can feel the wind directly and feel good.
Of course, it is light with Converse skateboard shoes.
Fashion and culture around skateboarding are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram carefully!
I also went to a salon run by a hairdresser of skaters in Yutenji.

At that time could be another good.
I wonder if they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I was disappointed because the patter was not good enough and I could not stretch it.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip in eagle came at #6.
I was able to get a chance at No. 7, but I was disappointed that I couldn't reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so it was good that I could keep it firmly even on a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference?
It was possible to take a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but the gallery was taking videos.
There were not many other things that changed, but there were only a few Japanese players in the competition jointly, so I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
The second half of the game will continue from now on, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for the winning king, so I want to win another one, and there is a ZOZO championship nearby, so I will do my best so that I can get the qualification to enter the top in that tournament.
How do I prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting things"?
Interviews and writings: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital I talked to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of the Stroke Center.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have decreased due to remarkable advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to the level of forgetting
― Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with fewer vegetables and proteins, and it becomes a life that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
Eventually, poverty becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you only have to look at TV vaguely, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation could be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books everyday and think about things that are not metabolized.
