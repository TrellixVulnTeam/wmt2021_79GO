Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents and incidents involving young people stepping on pedals - Yahoo!
Violations in violation of the Road Traffic Act
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading has been increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 pedal misstep accidents occurred at the age of 24 and over 1032.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet off?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to mistake inadvertently due to other things such as music and conversation, and trampling due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day and drive as they are.
Some people say that it is troublesome to change shoes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.
The first is "Reliable operation of steering wheel, brakes and other operations" and Article 70 "Disclosure of safety driving obligations" which stipulates "Do not drive to cause an accident and cause harm to a person."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committees, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Do not drive a vehicle (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operation or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operation, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operation."
The purpose of each prefecture is similar to that of considering driving as a violation of " footwear that may interfere with operation" even if it is not specified as a high heel.
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the heel does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs out.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch a high heel or heel, and sometimes the heel is caught and the pedal cannot be stepped on when suddenly braking, or the high heel is removed in the time signature when the heel is pulled, and it can not be stepped by pinching the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The two leaders appreciated the continued increase in trade and investment between the two countries amid the expansion of protectionism worldwide, and agreed to work together to expand economic cooperation in the future.
President Moon welcomed Bulgaria's policy of granting Korean companies the status of "strategic investors" and said he hoped that this would facilitate Korean companies' investment in Bulgaria.
In addition, he emphasized that Korea can be the best partner for Bulgaria as Bulgaria promotes the introduction of nuclear power plants and the modernization of defense, and called for attention and cooperation so that Korean companies can participate in the order of the Bulgarian government's nuclear power plant and the promotion of the defense industry.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of Awaji tile, filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer tile roofing away" due to the frequent earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code:53173983; capital of 9.92 million yen; 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture; representative Yukizo Fukuhara; 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and one other attorney.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tile, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. was merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd., and the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd. was succeeded, and at the same time, the head office was relocated to its present location after changing its present name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current structure was based on Ibushi-gawara, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat-paned tiles were manufactured at 70% and Japanese-style tiles such as Ibushi-gawara were manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker in Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, consumer demand was sluggish and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to approximately 1.345 million yen.
On the profit side, in addition to a decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company faced a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to carry out severe financing.
For this reason, although the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and funding conditions were gradually tight.
I couldn't help but give up on business continuity and this is the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

The city also plans to build a parking lot.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs disappeared, and Darvish pitcher (33) of the Cubs, who finished the pitch this season, told the interview, "I have not done anything for two days, but it is hard to watch baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses and a defensive margin of 3 and 98.
Especially in the second half of the game, the throwing form was stable and the opponent continued to play with the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball power.
"I was 33 years old and I didn't think it would be like that.In spring I thought, "I wonder if I'm going to end this way too," but I feel that I can't believe that I came back from there and went to a better place."
I was able to respond gradually from early June.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased, and the number of things we can do every day has increased."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that he had established himself one after another, his condition was greatly improved and his grades were improved accordingly.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year.
Dalvish, who has the right to opt out of the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it now, I'm going to talk to my agents and family," but "Basically, there's no dissatisfaction or fun about this team."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling seems to be firm.

The first day of the performance greeting of "Ninkyo Gakuen"
This is a painful story in which Yakuza and the head of the Tokimoto group, who are not interested in contributing to society, undertake the reconstruction of high school on the verge of bankruptcy, and solve many difficult problems with Giri Ninjo.
Nishida plays the leader of the group who is strong but doesn't hate somewhere, and Nishijima plays Himura, the No. 2 of the Tokimoto group that has always been choreographed by his parents.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I have been nervous until today."
"Not only during the shooting period, but also after the shooting, the members gathered frequently and talked about various things, so it was a very united team," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was a review meeting, which was just a drinking party that didn't reflect on at all," "It was a positive thing for the site to make such a time, team work became better, motivation increased, it continued regularly after the end, there are lots of good memories," he said.
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Nishijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drank too much, I often do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he is indebted to the other party," "It looks like a silaf, but was drunk?It's really a good drunk," and attracted laughter at the venue.
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to "make it a series if it is good reputation, it may be a series if it is good."I want to borrow your power and work hard to make it a series," Ito said, "We are too excited to make it a series," Nakao said, "I was disappointed because Nishida was singing when we watched the movie.
Prefectural Fishery Federation "Start discussion toward full-scale operation" Chairman Nozaki "Iwaki Minpo Official Website"
With the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident at TEPCO, discussions aimed at full-scale operation in each district and other areas regarding the test operation that continues in fisheries off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture became concrete.
Mr. Tetsu Nozaki, President of the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives of the prefecture, said, "As the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives of the prefecture, the flow toward full-scale operation is necessary, and I would like to gather representatives and start discussions."
The Union Presidents' Association also approved the formal addition of the species to the target fish species for test operations in the areas of Casago, Sakura Mas and Murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, where the restrictions on shipment were lifted.
The remaining undisclosed seafood became two fish species: the binosgai and the common cusp.
After the completion of the operation, President Nozaki responded to the press coverage and emphasized that the start of full-scale operation was not decided.
In response to the water treatment after purifying contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, Mr. Yoshiaki Harada, former Minister of the Environment and Ichiro Matsui, Mayor of Osaka City, said, "There is a question of Keren-like argument, and the position against ocean release remains unchanged."
In the discussion of full-scale operation, Akira Egawa, head of Iwaki City Fisheries Cooperative, pointed out that "it is necessary to suck up opinions from below," and said to respect the intentions of the members.
The Board of Directors is formed by a group of sub-branches to resolve the problems they face one by one, and to conclude the agreement as a city fishing cooperative.
Kanji Tachiya, head of the Soma Futaba Fishery Cooperative, said, "In addition to the fishermen, it is necessary to discuss with the buyers."
The Soma Futaba Fisheries Cooperative is supported by the government and seven new ships will enter next year.

beauty and ugliness?
The image of "snake" overlaps with the beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is the mysterious beauty and the expression of the shadow in common?
A number of works have been released since the 1950s, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I looked at it with my hands, I realized the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Baizu's work again.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when they have the beauty of the opposite," but because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of resentment that dwells in resentment ...
There is a keyword "snake" in what appears many in Baizu Kazuo's work, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly" may be "snakes" of creatures that unite the front and back.
This creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga Kowai!."
In general, it is a beautiful woman with a shadow that becomes a "hebijo."
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say that it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu work, but it reminds me of "snake" somewhere, such as falling asleep deep every 100 years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

[Yokoyama Wakamizu] A circle of children's cafeterias that offer free or inexpensive meals for children is spreading throughout the country.
According to research conducted by NPOs and other organizations, there are approximately 3,700 locations nationwide this year.
The number of locations in Fukui Prefecture increased by nine from last year to 24.
why is it now?
Makoto Yuasa, the chairman and social activist of the Kyoto NPO corporation, spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "We needed a place where people could interact with each other.
It is a "place of multi-generational exchange" where elderly people also participate, even if it is called the Kyoto Children's cafeteria.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
what's important is not to create children
There are various places to offer meals every day from January 1 to March 1.
There are a wide variety of venues ranging from private homes to temples.
There is an atmosphere that people who want to do can do.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes we hear about issues like a secure management system
"Connecting with society will become a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It is like the light of hope in closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo!News
"In recent years, Ababir, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the crashed US military.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
It is also a strength that it is difficult to get caught by radar because it flies in low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Shortly after, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Houthis faction, led by President Rouhani, and Iran cannot allow its hostile Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under circumstances where its own country cannot export crude oil, with the aim of informing the international community that if it continues to embargo crude oil against Iran, there will be pain in response."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid military intervention at least until the end of next year's election, and Iran will continue to bomb the Hoosiers with drones, knowing that the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever, and there is sufficient possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's " proxy war" is in imminent danger.
This is why YouTuber has become a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now extremely popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, some companies have started a unique system called "YouTuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Dr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary that actually adopted YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with youtuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter, Kobayashi): Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people admire.
It is also ranked in the career rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber adoption" is to adopt and support young people chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers don't get what they think.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation for creators hired.
At first, we will support activities by supporting the demerit of the profession called YouTuber, which inevitably becomes unstable.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA" Assistant Secretary of State for the United States (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 27 that "Korea hopes to reconsider and come back to the decision to destroy Japan and Korea's comprehensive military information protection agreement (GSOMIA) which expires on November 23."
It is unusual for a high-ranking U.S. official to mention a reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
South Korea announced in August that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and South Korea will collapse.
"Without GSOMIA, we can't effectively respond to the crisis."
He strongly urged the return of Korea, saying, "There is time until revocation."
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan was "the first in history" and stressed that "it is essential that the United States, Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, collaborate in alliance relations."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damaged the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of mediation," he said, "to play a positive role so that Japan and Korea can fill the gap."

The city, which produced Riko Kako and Chihiro Iwasaki, aims to create a town using picture books.
Mr. Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion I could understand for the first time."
I focused on the legend of the city of Awara, 'The face of the demon of the bride'.

"I forgot my hatred and returned with kindness and kindness, and I felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived, and completed the story "Meoto Oni" where a couple of heart-friendly demons and a boy appear.
From June, he drew 10 scenes with warm watercolors, taking advantage of his job, and the materials of picture books were scattered.
In addition, the cover of the picture book will be made with washi using Echizen Washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
This leads to an opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the touch of washi through reading and listening.
The goal of the donation is 850,000 yen for 600 copies.
The deadline is 25 October.
Mr. Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud throughout Japan.
I want to tell children what true kindness and compassion are handed down through picture books."
It is one of the projects that Fukui Prefecture certifies 11 projects for regional revitalization that are challenged by local cooperatives and businesses in the prefecture, and supports using hometown tax.
The Bank of Japan is cooperating with the Fukui Shimbun in its management support.

i want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[Look at all images] Is the release date of macOS Catalina October 4?
The above image was posted on Apple's website in Denmark (currently fixed).
The image certainly has the character "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4th.
On the official website, the accuracy of the information seems to be high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a subdisplay of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better with more perfection (or response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next generation macOS fully.

The video of the growth process is valuable, and the concerned parties want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photograph was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1 to 5 km off the coast of the Kamahara district, Shimizu Ward, the city.
A total of 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.
In the daytime, the conventional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea form a certain group at the bottom of the sea was reaffirmed.
The adult body is about 40 mm long and the individual reflected is about 23 mm long.
The spawning period was determined by matching the seasonal data of freshly caught sakura shrimp.
Detailed analysis is requested by Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Technical College, which form the team.
Keisuke Mizuno, Project Leader, said, "I want to capture the living figure of individuals in the growth process, including fry."

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] World champion Kento Momota and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the Badminton Big Event in August and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) which will open from the 17th.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic race from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the middle race (September to December).
The Badminton Olympic Games began in May, and at the end of the World Championships, the top athletes competed in four Super 500 and above.
Two key players in the first half were Kento Momota, who won 2 of the 4 races, and Tensei Zhou (Cho Tien Cheng) in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
The tournament that will be held in May is the Sudirman Cup (May / China), Indonesia OP (July / results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July) and World Championships (August).
Although the number of top players is small, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship race was held, so fatigue would not be greater than a series of wars.
It is expected that the best results will be obtained in the middle game, which will be held consecutively from September onwards.
A strong Taiwanese ace.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Zhou Tiancheng, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a strong player and does not suffer from a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to earn high points in the first half of the tournament will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that he lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and it became possible to continue the good performance firmly.
For Momota, the number one player in the world ranking, it seems to be a more troublesome opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Pranys B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the final in the top tournament, he has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the fourth in the second tournament this season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is able to rally on equal terms with the top players has a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranice B. went one step further in India, where he had a great selection of singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who are late for injury, are also catching up in the future, so the Indian forces after the midfield battle need to be careful.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released due to the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40%," and although expectations for price reduction were increasing, price competition did not occur.
Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market was postponed, and the oligopoly status of the three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to increase the number of devices to half.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will charge up to one third of the terminal fee only for subscribers of its own line.
The three companies seem to continue "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies must respond promptly.
The postponement of Rakuten was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be an explosive in the price reduction competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale service have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
The price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees for the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, and I do not think that it will be fine."
However, the government-made price reduction would distort the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost structure of each company is very complex and difficult to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there were cases where the consumer's burden exceeded half the cost of advertising such as "maximum half price."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by users themselves.
Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they have decided to reduce the maximum amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent the damage of special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank were lowered, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank was lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions, police officials, etc. and sent out at ATMs.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNA | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was born in Izutsu-shitsu and was a brother and son of Chikakata IZUTSU.
He died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the Kagamiyama room of the same family, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & brawl Overseas ripples in "face risk tackle" of U.S. players "Affront and vulgar play"- Yahoo!News
U.S. F. Quill played rough, and he was a former England national "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup Japan took place on the 26th, and the United States, the last to appear in 20 countries, lost 7-45 to England.
It began as a black star, but in the latter half of the film, Lafplay, played by FL John Quill, drew a ripple.
He leaves the scene with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insulting and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
In the midst of the enemy's depth, the English captain Farrell was somewhat out of balance when catching his ally's path.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and hit the upper body violently.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent come into contact, and it is shaped like a head thrust.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air of touch.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some people asked for a fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving" "It was almost a struggle by both sides."
The article introduces comments from former England international and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked a single player in the game, managed to escape the loss in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 public hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Japan Red Cross, which were judged to be "poor in clinical practice."
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awa Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of the city, and Awa Hospital, and Awa Hospital, respectively.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, local chiefs and residents are expected to rebel against the fear that nearby hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare surveyed 1455 public and public hospitals that can respond to "advanced acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
In the case of a hospital, it is necessary to consider abolishing or transferring some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 1246,000 beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high-acute" and "acute" periods, where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require high needs for elderly people.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, municipalities and medical officials are discussing it, many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive drill for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road, wide area by residents participation, for the first time in 18 years (video): Hokkaido Shimbun
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people attended, including officials and residents of 20 institutions, including roads and three towns.
It was held for the first time since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It has been 18 years since local residents participated in extensive training.
It is assumed that Mt.Komagatake erupted at 8:45 a.m. and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the level of volcanic alert was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in Mori and Nanae towns, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.
100,000 students appeal to Vancouver's climate demonstration against school holidays (Everyone's Economic Newspaper Network) - Yahoo!
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall across Canby Bridge to the downtown library.
A few hours before the start of the meeting, people with placards began to gather in front of the city hall.
The number of participants continued to increase and eventually over 100,000 people participated.
On the road along the way, the police also cooperated with the road regulation and watched for hours until all people finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, Vancouver has held a number of events to consider global warming since last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school on this day complained to adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I take a break from the school," and many adults who took part in the work off responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced on March 27 that it would revise the quarantine guidelines to prevent the spread of pork cholera, an infectious disease in livestock.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been confirmed to be infected.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but distribution outside the meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (an open call for opinions), we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of last September, Japan's status as a pure country has been temporarily suspended.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "Vaccination Recommended Area" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, how to proceed, etc., and will be confirmed by the ministry and approved by the governor's decision.
Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga are the seven other prefectures that have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and decide again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excretions is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they effectively tolerate distribution outside the region.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly dispose of food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Empire Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, we will conduct opinion inquiries and public comments to prefectures until October 7 and implement new quarantine guidelines.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, open approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and former MF Keisuke Honda, who is currently unaffiliated, took an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, approached a club with a public approach: "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the midst of a crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up to win the game.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
Today, United is in a state of emergency, with many injured, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marshal, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip hard, challenging the quality of the front line.
Honda was named by the Australian media as a candidate for a new force to enter the Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole Andreas Pereira fills."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to get away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team and get full attention."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward for veterans who have declared their goal for the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce, shops, etc. | Shizuoka Shimbun at es
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that is freely loaned to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCC) announced on June 26 that it has completed the installation of a total of 500 portable translation machine "PokeTalk" at its member offices for free.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator intensively in the same region, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" also started to show the locations of "stores in foreign languages" on smartphones.
It is accessible from the Lake Hamana Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Poketalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
A representative from the Chamber of Commerce said, "I would like you to develop new foreign customers in a difficult business environment."
right now, ikemura hiroyo, a naodra master, doesn't need a tipup for the first shot?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shot is not necessarily a tie-up.
There is also a technique called "naodora" to hit a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of par 5 etc.
In recent years, 1W has the risk of scattering the ball due to its large head volume, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, 24 years old is 166 cm tall and small, but he is currently seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I'd try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tielia, and sometimes a 1W is shaken.
In the case where a big carry is required, the tip is often used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
He recorded between 270 and 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W, so I don't need 3W.
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I am also happy to hear the exclamation from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, you can't fly straight even if you hit it on the upper.If it's a cut track, you go to the right.I was originally doing a straight dora to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
If the ball is not caught, it is at risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off" .
It is a professional technique that you can not think of.

GQ Men's 10 Day 9 Skateboarding with Friends - Yahoo!
The means of transportation is exclusively skateboarding!
I have been hooked since my friend invited me to slide.
I'm still a beginner, but it feels good to run through the asphalt with push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because it can be hands-free with smartphones, wallets and luggage.
With shorts, you can feel the wind directly and feel good.
Of course, it is light with Converse skateboard shoes.
Fashion and culture around skateboarding are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram carefully!
Haircuts also went to a salon run by a hairdresser at Yutenji.

Greta started writing, "You see, it started again, and as you realize, those who dislike me are still active, chasing around my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come up with the only possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They pointed out that adults seem to be distracting from the issue because they do not want to face climate and environmental crises.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I wonder if they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I was disappointed because the seater was not good enough and I could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip in eagle came at #6.
I was able to get a chance at 7th, but I regret not being able to reach it in the second half.
what did you get at this tournament?
Recently (shot) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I could keep it firmly even on a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance to hit was changed, so I did not have much (experience) so I studied quite well.
What is the difference?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but quite a few gallery people were filming videos.
There were not many other things that changed, but since there were few Japanese players in co-hosting the tournament, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the race will continue from now on, but if you do not win more than one, you should not aim for the prize king, so I want to win another one, and there is also a ZOZO championship nearby, so I will do my best so that I can get the qualification to enter the top in that tournament.
How do I prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting things"?
Interview: Yo WATANABE
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I spoke to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as death from infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer death has decreased due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region, not only by itself or family.
How to keep things to the level of forgetting
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity are not available, and people living in environments where cooking is not possible can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
Eventually, poverty becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you only have to look at TV vaguely, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can happen in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books everyday and think about things that are not metabolic.
