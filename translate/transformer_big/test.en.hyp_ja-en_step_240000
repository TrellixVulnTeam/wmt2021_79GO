Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents and incidents involving young people stepping on pedals - Yahoo!
Violations in violation of the Road Traffic Act
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading has been increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 pedal misstep accidents occurred at the age of 24 and over 1032.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet off?
is it safe?
There is no description of gender ratio or cause in this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, it is possible for young people to accidentally make mistakes due to other things such as music and conversation, and clothing.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day and drive as they are.
Although some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change shoes, some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.
The first is "Reliable operation of steering wheel, brakes and other operations" and Article 70 "Disobedience of safety driving obligation" which stipulates "Do not drive to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by the respective prefectural public safety committees, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Do not drive vehicles (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that interferes with driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations."
Even if it is not specified as a high heel, the purpose of each prefecture is similar to that of regard as a violation of driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation."
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a starting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to secure firmly so that the heel does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs out, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot destination that is grounded on the pedal is smaller and it is difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be firmly stepped.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material tends to catch the heel heel heel heel heel, pedal can not be stepped on when suddenly braking, or high heel can be removed when the heel is caught, and it can be stuck in the back of the pedal and cannot be stepped on.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal disappears.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of Awaji tiles, filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer tile roofing away" due to the frequent earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code:53173983, capitalized 9.92 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self-insolvency at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and one other attorney.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tile, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged with Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70% and Japanese-style tiles such as Ibushi-gawara were manufactured at 30%.
The company has built a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker in Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, consumer demand was sluggish and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to approximately 1.345 million yen.
On the profit side, in addition to a decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make severe financial arrangements.
For this reason, although financial institutions were trying to rebuild their business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, there were no signs of recovery in business conditions, and funding conditions were gradually tight.
I couldn't help but give up on business continuity and this is the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

"Rinkyo Gakuen" first day of the stage greeting
This is a painful story in which Yakuza and the head of the Tokimoto group, who are not interested in contributing to society, take on the reconstruction of high school on the verge of bankruptcy and solve many difficult problems with Giri Ninjo.
Nishida plays the head of the group that is strong but doesn't hate somewhere, and Nishijima plays Himura, who is the No. 2 of the Tokimoto group that has always been choreographed by his parents.
On the first day of the festival, Nishijima said, "I've been nervous until today."
"Not only during the shooting period, but also after the shooting was over, the members gathered frequently and were a very united team that talked about various things," he says.
Ito also laughs, "There was a review meeting, which was just a drinking party that didn't reflect on at all," "It was a positive thing for the site to make such a time, team work became better, motivation increased, it continued regularly after the end, and there are lots of good memories."
The story of the drinking party revealed the surprising face of Nishijima.
Nishijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drink too much, I often do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how he is indecent, but I don't know who he is."
It became a work that nurtured good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his desire to "make it a series if reputation is good, I would like to do my best to make it a series with your power," Ito said, "We are too excited to make it a series" and Nakao said, "We were disappointed because Nishida was singing when we watched the movie.

beauty and ugliness?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is the mysterious beauty in common with the expression of shadow?
A number of works have been sent out to the world since the 1950s, "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019, focusing on beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Baizu, who is known as the leading figure of "Fear Manga."
When I look at it in my hand, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Baizu's work again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of the girls who are at the opposite end."
There is a keyword "snake" in what appears in many Baizu Kazuo works, but snakes are perceived as "spicy creatures" by the viewer, or people who feel "beautiful" There are various ways to receive it.
Some people like reptiles and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly" may be "snakes" of creatures that unite the front and back.
This creature has been worshipped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
Baizu works based on that "snake" include "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 "Mama ga kowai!" series.
In general, it is a beautiful woman with a shadow that becomes a "hebijo."
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu work, but in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, the part with strange power is reminiscent of "snake."

The number increased by one to six times compared to 2018, and there were 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by nine from last year.
why is it a cafeteria now?
Makoto Yuasa, chairman of the Kyoto NPO and social activist, spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became deserted and shopping streets declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So, he said, "We needed a place where people could interact with each other.
It is a "place of multi-generational exchange" where elderly people also participate, even if it is called the Kyoto Children's cafeteria.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
what's important is not to create children from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day from January 1st.
There are a wide variety of venues ranging from private homes to temples.
It is becoming an atmosphere that people who want to do can do.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes we hear about issues like a secure management system
"Connecting with society will become a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo!News
"In recent years, Ababir, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the crashed US military.
It can be manufactured at low cost and has a range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to get caught by radar because it flies in low air." (Toru Yokota, a news photographer)
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Houthis faction, led by President Rouhani, that under circumstances where the country is unable to export crude oil, the hostile Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to make a profit from crude oil; if Iran continues to embargo crude oil against Iran, it aims to inform the international community that the pain associated with it will be accompanied."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and crude oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid military intervention at least until the end of next year's election, and Iran will continue to bomb drones with Hoosiers in hiding, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever, and there is enough possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" is in imminent danger.
The reason why YouTuber of super personality became a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 distribution
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it to advertise their products, some companies have started an unusual system called "YouTuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX, who is also a representative of the subsidiary and staff first that actually adopted YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with youtuber.
What is YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter "Kobayashi"): Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people admire.
It is also ranked in the career rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
Up until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber adoption" is to recruit and support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming a YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers don't get the revenue they think.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation for the creators we hired.
At first, we will support activities by supporting the disadvantage of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 27 that "Korea hopes to reconsider and come back to the decision to destroy Japan and Korea's comprehensive military information protection agreement (GSOMIA) which expires on November 23."
It is unusual for a U.S. official to mention a reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is the basis for sharing missile launch information and other information concluded by Japan, South Korea, Japan, the United States, and South Korea.
South Korea announced in August that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and South Korea will collapse.
"Without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis," said Napper.
He strongly urged South Korea to return, saying, "There is time until revocation."
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan was "the first in history" and stressed that "it is essential that the United States, Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, collaborate in alliance relations."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damages the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

Tokaimura criticality accident, 20 years in 30 days 300 nuclear facility troubles: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) reported 336 cases of accidents and failures at nuclear facilities across Japan between 2000 and 2006 following the critical accident in Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture, the first in the history of nuclear power in Japan.
It has been 30 days and 20 years since the critical accident that alarmed the safety myth of the nuclear industry.
According to the report, although the level 0 (non-safety critical) and non-assessment issues accounted for about 90% of the international assessment scale (INES), which shows seriousness, it is necessary to raise safety awareness continuously based on lessons learned from the accident and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident of TEPCO in 2011.
Koichi Soda, who has completed the story and original drawings of creative picture books, is soliciting donations for publication.
Koichi Soda (64), an artist from the Echizen City Regional Development Cooperation Volunteer in Fukui Prefecture, started a crowdfunding campaign aimed at publishing creative picture books inspired by legends in Fukui Prefecture in order to promote town development using picture books.
Mr. Soda, who was originally from Hokkaido and started his activities as a member of the cooperative group in April this year, says, "I want to convey the hearts of the people of Fukui based on deep faith through picture books."
[Donation is here] To convey the heart of Fukui.
While Mr. Soda is active as an artist working on contemporary art based on mathematics, he has also been active as a member of the cooperative team since past the Kanreki era.
After working on the town development of Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi, he arrived in Echizen City in April this year.
The city, which produced Riko Kako and Chihiro Iwasaki, aims to create a town using picture books.
Mr. Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion I could understand for the first time."
What attracted attention was the legend of the city of Awara, "The face of the demon of the wife Odoshi."
In contrast to the mother-in-law's mother-in-law who couldn't take off the demon's face, a gentle-hearted bride-in-law continues to chant Nenbutsu to help her mother-in-law without worrying about being surprised by her face.
"I forgot my hatred and returned with kindness and kindness, and I felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived to complete the story "Meoto Oni" where a husband and wife of a gentle demon and a boy appear.
From June, he drew 10 scenes with warm watercolors, taking advantage of his job, and the materials of picture books were scattered.
In addition, the cover of picture books will be made with washi using Echizen Washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
This will lead to an opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the touch of washi through reading and listening.
The goal of the donation amount is 850,000 yen for 600 copies.
The deadline is October 25.
Mr. Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud all over Japan.
I want to tell children what true kindness and compassion are handed down through picture books."
It is one of the projects that Fukui Prefecture certifies 11 projects for regional revitalization challenged by the cooperation team and business operators in the prefecture, and supports using hometown tax payment.
The Fukui Shimbun publishes information and the Fukui Bank cooperates with management support.
Donations can be made from the crowdfunding website Lady For.

i want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but maybe it will be released on October 4th?
[Look at all images] Is the release date of macOS Catalina October 4th?
The above image was posted on Apple's website in Denmark (currently corrected).
The image certainly has a character "from October 4th (fra den 4. oktober) ."
On the official website, the accuracy of the information seems to be high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the most feature I personally want to try on macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a subdisplay of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be superior in perfection (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to fully experience this next generation macOS.

The Yui Sakura Ebi Project, a marine industry cluster council led by industry, academia, and government in Shizuoka City, has recently succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp, which is thought to have been born during the spawning season this spring and summer, at a depth of 290 meters in Suruga Bay.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the concerned parties want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of sakura shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photograph was taken near the bottom of the sea about 1 to 5 km off the coast of the Kamahara district, Shimizu Ward, the city.
A total of about 300 were confirmed in 17 minutes.
In the daytime, the traditional knowledge that sakura shrimp in the deep sea form a certain group at the bottom of the sea was reaffirmed.
The adult body is about 40 mm long and the individual reflected is about 23 mm long.
The spawning period was identified by matching the seasonal data of the caught sakura shrimp.
Detailed analysis is requested by Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Technical College, which make up the team.
Keisuke Mizuno, Project Leader, said, "I want to capture the living figure of individuals in the growth process, including fry."

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] World champion Kento Momoda and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
At the Badminton Big Event in August, Japan won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic race from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympic Games, we will look forward to the men's singles for the middle game (September to December).
The Badminton Olympics, which began in May, digested four of the top athletes (Super500 and above) at the end of the World Championships.
In the first half of the competition, the two players were Kento Momota, who won 2 of the 4 races, and Tensei Zhou (Cho Tian Cheng).
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
He also won the Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been held in four groups: the Sudirman Cup (May / China), the Indonesia OP (July / results are over 16), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of top players is small, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship race was held, so fatigue would not be greater than a series of wars.
It is expected that good results will be obtained in the middle of the series of high-level tournaments since September.
A strong Taiwanese ace in a series of battles.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Shutensei, who also won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), already participated in 7 tournaments.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the championship.
He is a strong player and does not suffer from a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to score high points in the first half will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and it became possible to continue the good performance firmly.
For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world ranking, it seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the final at the top level, he has the power to advance to the top level, such as entering the best 4 in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is now able to rally equal to the top player seems to have a great potential to leap forward in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranice B. also went one step further in India, where he had a great selection of singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who is late for injury, are also catching up in the future, so the Indian army after the midfield battle needs attention.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new pricing plan for mobile phone companies was released due to the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40 percent," and although expectations for price reduction were increasing, price competition did not occur.
Rakuten's full-scale entry was postponed, and the oligopoly status of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half the price.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" system that can not use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will charge up to one third of the terminal fee only for subscribers of its own line.
The three companies seem to continue "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies must respond promptly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be a catalyst for lower price competition, so it looks like it is shoulder-to- shoulder.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale service have not been disclosed.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
The price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, and I do not think that it will be fine."
However, it is unlikely that the government-made price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost structure of each company is very complex and difficult to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there were cases where the consumer's burden exceeded half the cost of advertising such as "maximum half price."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings.
Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they have decided to lower their withdrawal limit using cash cards to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
The three banks of the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be reduced from October 1 to November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions, police officials, etc. and sent out at ATMs.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAGA | Shizuoka Shimbun at es
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from Izutsu-shitsu including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to Mutsu-shitsu upon the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI (former Sekiwaki Retroboko).

Ojikata ITSUTSU died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the Kagamiyama room of the same family, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & brawl "Face danger tackle" of U.S. players overseas ripple "An insult and cowardly play"- Yahoo!News
The U.S. FL Quill was a rough play, a former England national "not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was the 26th edition of the tournament, with the United States losing 7-45 to England.
It began as a black star, but in the latter half of the year, Lafplay played by FL John Quill called for a ripple.
He leaves with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insulting and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The real moment of the face danger tackle played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the second half of 29 minutes.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply entrenched in the enemy's field, was somewhat out of balance when catching a pass on his side.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent come into contact, and the shape that pierces the head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
English players protested against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.
The players of both armies gathered at once and became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some people asked for fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" headlined "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving" "almost a brawl by both sides."
The article introduces comments from former England international and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's an insult, it's a coward, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked one player in the game, managed to escape the loss in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Kyle's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced for the first time the names of 424 public hospitals in 1455 public hospitals nationwide and public hospitals such as Japan Red Cross, which judged that "the medical record is poor."
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of straw City, and Awara Hospital, and the Three Kingdom Hospital of Sakai City.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent medical expenses from expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, local chiefs and residents are expected to rebel against the fear that nearby hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals targeted was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "high acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
In the case of a hospital, it is necessary to consider abolishing or transferring some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare aims to reduce the number of beds in hospitals with 12.466,000 beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "Advanced acute phase" and "Acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require high needs for the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing names of hospitals with poor results.

100,000 Students Appeal to Vancouver Climate Demo for School Break Global Warming - Yahoo!News
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall across Canby Bridge to the downtown library.
People with placards began gathering in front of the city hall a few hours before the start, and at 13 o'clock at the start time, it was enough to fill the road of the city hall front block.
The number of participants continued to increase and eventually over 100,000 people participated.
On the road along the way, the police also cooperated with the road regulation and watched for hours until everyone finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, Vancouver has held a number of events to consider global warming since last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took a break from school on this day appealed to adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I take a break from the school," and many adults who took a break from work responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) released on July 27 a draft amendment to the quarantine guidelines that enable preventive vaccination against domestic pigs, which are not currently recognized, in order to prevent the spread of pork cholera.
The prefecture will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been confirmed to be infected.
Live pigs and fertilized eggs vaccinated are restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After making public comments to the general public (an open call for opinions), we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of last September, Japan's status as a pure country has been temporarily suspended.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "Vaccination Recommended Area" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed, and will be confirmed by the ministry and approved by the governor.
Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga are the seven other prefectures that have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and decide again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, excreted objects, etc. is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted in light of the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they effectively tolerate distribution outside the region.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly dispose of food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Control Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, a public approach to Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
Last season, he left the Melbourne Victory of the Australian A-League, and Keisuke Honda of the former Japan national team, who is currently independent, took an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th September, approached a club with a public approach: "Please give me an offer, I don't need money, but I need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could grab in the midst of a crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up to win the game.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Aure Gunner Surshar, is forced to slip out of the race with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faces challenges in the quality of the front line.
Honda was named by the Australian media as a potential new force for Teco.
"Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole Andreas Pereira fills."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward for veterans who have declared their goal to participate in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and shops|Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of a total of 500 portable translation machine "PokeTalk" at its member offices for free.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator intensively in the same region, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60 percent.
The map app "Google Map" has also started to show the location of "stores that support foreign languages" on smartphones.
It is accessible from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Poketalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with an initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
A representative from the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want you to develop new foreign customers in a difficult business environment."
right now, ikemura hiroyo, a famous naodra, doesn't need a tipup for the first shot?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shot is not necessarily a tie-up.
There is also the so-called "direct dora" technique in which you hit a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance with a second hit of par 5.
Recently, 1W has the risk of scattering balls due to its large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, 24 years old is 166 cm tall, but he is currently seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't want to shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I'd try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tielia and sometimes a 1W swing is thrown.
In the case where a big carry is required, the tip is often used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
He recorded between 270 and 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W, and caddy can feel more secure than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
I am also happy to hear the exclamation from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit it on the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, you go to the right.I was originally doing a straight dora to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
The ball is not caught and is at risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off (not bent to the left) ."
It is a professional technique that you can not think of.

But don't spend your time paying more attention to them.
The world is starting to awaken.
Change is coming.
Whether adults like that change or not.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to expand to the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I was disappointed because the patter was not good enough and I could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, there were still par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of retaking it, chip in eagle came at #6.
I was able to get a chance at the 7th, but I regret not being able to reach it in the second half.
what did you get at this tournament?
Recently (shots) didn't work well, so it was good that I could keep it firmly even on a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the way to beat and the distance changed.
What is the difference?
It seems that it was possible to take a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but quite a few gallery people were filming videos.
There were not many other things that changed, but since there are few Japanese players in co-hosting the tournament, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to foreign players."
The second half of the game will continue from now on, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for the prize king, so I want to win another one, and there is a ZOZO championship nearby, so I will do my best so that I can get the qualification to participate in that tournament.
What is a method to prevent dementia from becoming "forgetting things"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be kept to an extremely mild and forgotten degree.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center We spoke to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as death from infectious diseases and accidents has decreased and cancer death has decreased due to remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
We need to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the community.
how to keep things to the level of forgetting
― Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people with metabolic syndrome tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity are not available, and people living in environments where cooking is not possible can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you only have to look at TV vaguely, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books on a daily basis.
