Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving incorrect pedaling of young people - Yahoo!News
Violations in violation of the Road Traffic Act
The number of reports on accidents caused by incorrect operation such as pedal treading has been increasing, and it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 pedal misstep accidents occurred at the age of 24 and over 1032.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you want to take your feet off?
is it safe?
There is no description of gender ratio or cause in this data, but unlike elderly people who are often thought to come from a decline in their bodies, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is also a possibility that young people are inadvertently misled by other things such as music and conversation, and trampling errors due to clothes etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day and drive as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but it is troublesome to change shoes, but some people do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without evil.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.
The first is "Reliable operation of steering wheel, brake and other operations" and Article 70 "Disobedience of safety driving obligation" which stipulates that "Do not drive to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by each prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Do not drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) by wearing sandals, slippers, hanging, high heels or other footwear that may interfere with driving operation, or by wearing footwear in a manner that interferes with driving operation."
Even if it is not specified as a high heel, the purpose of each prefecture is the same as to regard driving as a violation of " footwear that may interfere with driving operation."
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a supporting point.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to secure firmly so that the heel does not break.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and the heel always blurs out, and because the height of the heel has an angle throughout the foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller, and it is difficult to make fine adjustments that can not be stepped firmly.
This is considered dangerous.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch the heel heel heel heel heel and pedal can not be stepped in when suddenly braking, or high heel can be removed by the time the heel is pulled, and it can not be stepped in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when stepping back after stepping on the pedal, and the accelerator pedal is not returned.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of Awaji tiles, filed for quasi-self-bankruptcy Liabilities of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer tile roofing away" due to frequent earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code: 530173983; capital of 9.92 million yen; 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture; representative Yukizo Fukuhara; 44 employees) filed for quasi-self bankruptcy at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture; Daichi Yoshida Law Office; telephone 06-6365-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged into Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd., succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., and at the same time, the head office was moved to the present location after changing the name of the present business.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and Ibushi-gawara was mainly used before, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as flat plate tiles were manufactured at 70% and Ibushi-gawara was manufactured at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, construction materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker in Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, consumer demand was sluggish and annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to approximately 1.345 million yen.
On the profit side, in addition to a decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make severe financial arrangements.
For this reason, although the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, there were no signs of recovery in business conditions and funding conditions were gradually tight.
I couldn't help but give up on business continuity and this is the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.

beauty and ugliness?
The image of "snake" overlaps with the beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!News
Is the mysterious beauty in common with the expression of shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.In August 2019, "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released, which focuses on beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Baizu, who is known as the leading figure of "Fear Manga."
When I look at it with my hands, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Baizu's work again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Kazuo Baizu's work
In the preface of the Bijo Collection, there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of the girls who are opposite," but it may be more "fear" because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of resentment that dwells in resentment ...
There is a keyword "snake" in what appears many in Baizu Kazuo's work, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly" may be "snake" creatures that are united in the front and back.
This creature has been worshiped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where "white snake" lived is good luck.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama ga Kowai!."
In general, it is a beautiful woman with a shadow that becomes a "hebijo."
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu work, but in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, the part with strange power is reminiscent of "snake."

Koshiyama Wakamizu: A circle of children's cafeterias, which offer free or inexpensive meals for children, is spreading throughout Japan.
According to research conducted by NPOs and other organizations, there are about 3,700 locations nationwide this year.
The number increased by one to six times compared to 2018, and there were 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by nine compared to last year.
why is it now?
Makoto Yuasa, chairman and social activist of the Kyoto NPO corporation, spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So, he said, "We needed a place where people could interact with each other.
It is a "place of multi-generational exchange" where elderly people also participate, even if it is called the Kyoto Children's cafeteria.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
what's important is not to create children from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day from one month to the next.
There are a wide variety of venues ranging from private homes to temples.
There is an atmosphere that people who want to do can do.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes we hear about issues like a secure management system
"Connecting with society will become a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It is like the light of hope in closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo!News
"In recent years, Ababir, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from the crashed US military.
It can be manufactured cheaply and has a range of about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that it's difficult to get caught by radar because it flies in low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Shortly after, Yemen's anti-government organization, the Houthis faction, made a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Houthis faction, led by President Rouhani, and Iran cannot allow the hostile Saudis to make profits of crude oil under circumstances where their own countries cannot export crude oil, and if they continue to embargo crude oil against Iran, it aims to make the international community aware that the pain associated with it will be accompanied."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"With Trump's pledge to withdraw U.S. forces from the Middle East, at least until the end of next year's elections, we want to avoid any military intervention, and after that, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Hoosiers, but the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever, and there is sufficient possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" is in imminent danger.
That's why YouTuber became a regular employee.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
September 27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it to advertise their products, some companies have started a unique system called "YouTuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
We interviewed Dr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary that actually adopted YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter "Kobayashi"): Now YouTuber is a profession that many young people admire.
It is also ranked in the top job rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will increase steadily in the future.
We have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber adoption" aims to support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the job of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers can't get the revenue they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not allow their family to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we employ.
At first, we will support activities by supporting the disadvantage of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Assistant Secretary of State (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!
U.S. Under Secretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador in Tokyo, said on November 27 that "Korea hopes to reconsider and come back to the decision to destroy the military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA) between Japan and Korea that expires on November 23."
It is unusual for a senior U.S. official to mention a reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United States, and South Korea to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
"Without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis," said Napper.
He strongly urged the return of Korea, saying, "There is time until revocation."
He also pointed out that the joint flight training conducted by China and Russia in July over the Sea of Japan was "the first in history" and stressed that "it is essential that the United States, Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, collaborate in alliance relations."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "damages the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of mediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

Tokaimura criticality accident, 20 years in 30 days 300 nuclear facility troubles: Hokkaido Shimbun
According to an interview with the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), 336 cases of accidents and failures at nuclear facilities across Japan were reported between 2000 and 2006 following the critical accident in Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture, which was the first in the history of nuclear power in Japan.
It has been 30 days and 20 years since the critical accident that alarmed the safety myth of the nuclear industry.
In the report, although the International Assessment Scale (INES), which shows seriousness, accounted for about 90% of the cases (not important for safety) and those that were not evaluated, it is necessary to continuously raise safety awareness based on lessons learned from the accident and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident of TEPCO in 2011.
Koichi Soda, who has completed the story and original drawings of creative picture books, is soliciting donations for publication.
Koichi Soda (64), an artist from the Echizen City Regional Development Cooperation Volunteer in Fukui Prefecture, started a crowdfunding campaign aimed at publishing creative picture books inspired by legends in Fukui Prefecture in order to promote town development using picture books.
Mr. Soda, who was originally from Hokkaido and started his activities as a member of the cooperative group in April this year, says, "I want to convey the heart of the kindness of Fukui people based on deep faith through picture books."
[Donation is here] To convey Fukui's heart.
While Mr. Soda is active as an artist working on contemporary art based on mathematics, he has also been active as a co-operative since the end of the calendar.
After working on the town development of Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi, he joined Echizen City in April this year.
The city, which produced Riko Kako and Chihiro Iwasaki, aims to create a town using picture books.
Mr. Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion that I could understand for the first time."
What attracted attention was the legend of the city of Awara, 'The face of the demon of the bride'.
In contrast to the mother-in-law who couldn't take off the demon's face, the gentle-hearted bride-in-law continues to chant Nenbutsu (Buddhist invocation) to help her mother-in-law without worrying about being surprised by her face.
"I forgot my hatred, returned with kindness and kindness, and felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived to complete the story "Meoto Oni" where a couple and a boy of gentle demons appear.
From June, he drew 10 scenes with warm watercolors, taking advantage of his job, and the materials of picture books were mixed.
In addition, the cover of picture books will be made with washi using Echizen washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
This is a chance for parents and children to enjoy the touch of Japanese paper by reading and listening.
The goal of the donation amount is 850,000 yen for 600 copies.
The deadline is October 25.
Mr. Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud throughout Japan.
I want to tell children what true kindness and compassion are handed down through picture books."
It is one of the projects that Fukui Prefecture certifies 11 projects for regional revitalization that are challenged by the cooperation team and business operators in the prefecture, and supports using hometown tax.
The Fukui Shimbun publishes information and the Fukui Bank cooperates with management support.
Donations can be made from the crowdfunding website Lady For.

i want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina operating system will be launched in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[Look at all images] Is the release date of macOS Catalina October 4?
The above image was posted on Apple's website in Denmark (currently fixed).
The image certainly has a letter "from October 4 (fra den 4. oktober) ."
On the official website, the accuracy of the information seems to be high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the most feature I personally want to try on macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a subdisplay of Mac, which was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's genuine function, it is expected to be superior in perfection (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next generation macOS fully.

Detailed analysis is requested by Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Technical College, which comprise the team.
Keisuke Mizuno, Project Leader, said, "I want to capture the living figure of individuals in the growth process, including fry."

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] World champion Kento Momota and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team won six medals at the Badminton Big Event in August and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Olympic race from May to August, which started next year's Tokyo Olympics, we will look forward to the men's singles for the middle race (September to December).
The Badminton Olympics, which began in May, digested four of the top athletes (Super500 and above) at the end of the World Championships.
Two key players in the first half were Kento Momota, who won 2 of the 4 races, and Tensei Zhou of Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
Since May, the tournament has been held in four groups: the Sudirman Cup (May / China), the Indonesia OP (July / results are over 16), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Fewer than the other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was only one of the World Championships, fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
It is expected that good results will be obtained in the middle of the consecutive high-level tournament from September.
A strong Taiwanese ace.
Also attention to young Thai people!
Zhou Tiancheng, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), already participated in seven tournaments.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, being able to score high points in the first half will make it easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that he lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased, and he was able to continue his good performance firmly.
For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world ranking, it will be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was won by Thailand's young ace Cantaphone and India's Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Anders Antonsen who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantaphone does not advance to the final in the top tournament, it has the power to advance to the top, such as entering the best 4 in the second tournament this season.
Although there is still a rough side, 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is able to rally on equal terms with top players seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranice B. also went one step further in India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Slicans Kidambi, who is late for injury, are also catching up in the future, so the Indian army after the midfield battle needs attention.
New charges for mobile phones Reduce prices with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in response to the revision of the Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it was generally high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower the price by about 40 percent," and although expectations for price reduction were rising, price competition did not occur.
Rakuten's full-scale entry was postponed, and the oligopolistic condition of the three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amended Act prohibits set discounts on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, it was set to be expensive.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to increase the number of devices to half.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" system that can not use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will charge up to one third of the terminal fee only for subscribers of its own line.
The three companies seem to continue "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate removal of SIM locks.
Companies must respond promptly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the fact that the development of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
It was expected to be a catalyst for lower price competition, so it looks like it is shoulder-to- shoulder.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale service have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want you to take responsibility for your business.
The price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, and I do not think that it will be fine."
However, it is unlikely that the government-made price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost structure of each company is very complex and difficult to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there were cases where the consumer's burden exceeded half the cost of advertising such as "maximum half price."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by users themselves.
Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on February 26 that they have decided to reduce the maximum amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent the damage of special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
The three-tier Kuwana Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be lowered on October 1 and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank will be lowered on November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions, police officials, etc. and sent out at ATMs.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNA | Shizuoka Shimbun at es
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAMI and one Tokoyama to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata IZUTSU (former Sekiwaki sakihoko).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki), was from Izutsu's room and was a brother and son of Chikakata IZUTSU.
On the 16th, Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the Kagamiyama room of the same family, and future treatment was discussed.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Mt. Juryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout & brawl Overseas ripples "Affective and vulgar play" in "face danger tackle" of US players - Yahoo!News
The American FL Quill played rough, and the former England national team, "It's not called tackle."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was the 26th edition of the tournament, with the United States losing 7-45 to England.
He started out as a black star, but later played by FL John Quill, Rafplay called the ripple.
One shot leaves in the form of adding shoulder tackle to the opponent's face.
The actual scene was released by overseas media with video, and former English players complained that it was "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insult and vulgar play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
I arrived at 0-38 in the last 29 minutes.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply entrenched in the enemy's ranks, was somewhat out of balance when he caught the pass of his ally.
Quill went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent come into contact and pierce the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some people asked for fair play to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave for poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a gruesome shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and left the field."
The article introduces the comments of former England international player and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The United States, which lacked one player in the game, managed to escape the loss in the 81st minute with a big try.
However, Quill's play left behind a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 public hospitals in 1455 national public hospitals and public hospitals such as JRCS, which judged that "the medical record is poor."
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare verified the treatment record of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awa Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of the city, and Awa Hospital, and Sakai Municipal Three Kingdom Hospital, respectively.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization: standards are wrong
In order to reduce medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we will request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, local chiefs and residents are expected to rebel against the fear that nearby hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The hospital covered 29.1% of the total, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to "high acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital should consider abolishing and transferring some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare aims to reduce the number of beds in hospitals with 1,2466,000 beds (18 years) to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation for elderly people with high needs.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, municipalities and medical officials are discussing it, many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive training on disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komagatake eruption, road, etc. Wide area with participation of residents, 18 years (video): Hokkaido Shimbun Ishin Electronic version

100,000 Students Appeal to Vancouver Climate Demo for School Break Global Warming - Yahoo!News
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall across Canby Bridge to the downtown library.
People with placards started gathering in front of the city hall of the meeting place a few hours before the start, and at 13 o'clock at the start time it was enough to fill the road of the city hall front block.
The number of participants continued to increase and eventually over 100,000 people participated.
On the road along the way, the police also cooperated with the road regulation and watched for hours until all people finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York, the city of Vancouver has held many events to think about global warming since last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took a break from school on this day appealed to adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I take a break from the school," and many adults who took a break from work responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced on March 27 that it would revise the quarantine guidelines to prevent the spread of pork cholera, a disease that has been transmitted to livestock.
The province will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been confirmed to be infected.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but distribution outside the meat and processed foods is permitted.
After public comments to the general public, etc., we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "Vaccination Recommended Area" based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, how to proceed, etc.
Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga are the seven other prefectures that have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and decide again.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and excreted objects, etc., is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they effectively tolerate distribution outside the region.
In order to prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day, and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Empire Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, we will conduct opinion inquiries and public comments to prefectures until October 7 and implement new quarantine guidelines.
Open approach to independent Keisuke Honda and Man U!
"I don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
After leaving Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League last season, former MF Keisuke Honda, who is currently unaffiliated, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda Was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, approached a club with a public approach: "Please give me an offer, I don't need money, but I need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could grab in the midst of a crisis of injuries," five unaffiliated players were picked up to win the game.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to make a hard run with 2 wins and 22 losses in the league and faces challenges in the quality of the front line.
Honda was named by the Australian media as a potential new force for Teco.
"Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill the hole Andreas Pereira fills."
Nine goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward for veterans who have declared their goal to participate in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce, shops, etc. | Shizuoka Shimbun at es
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that is freely loaned to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of a total of 500 portable translation machine "PokeTalk" at its member offices for free.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator intensively in the same area, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The municipality accounts for 60%.
The map app "Google Map" also started to show the location of "stores with foreign languages" on smartphones.
It can be accessed from the Hamanako Tourist Area website.
The free loan of Poketok, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April with the initiative that received the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
A representative from the Chamber of Commerce said, "I would like you to develop new foreign customers in a difficult business environment."
right now, ikemura hiroyo, a famous nadora, doesn't need to tie up the first shot?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shot is not necessarily a tie-up.
There is also the so-called "naodora" technique in which you hit a ball on the ground when you want to make a distance with a second hit of par 5 etc.
In recent years, 1W has the risk of scattering balls due to its large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
It is Kansei Ikemura who is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year as a professional, 24 years old is 166 cm tall and small, but he is currently seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he opened his eyes saying, "Because the shot of the spoon (3W) was bad, I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of Tielia, and occasionally swings 1W.
In the case where big carry is required, the tip is often used, but both sides make effective use of Naodora in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is lowered."
The ballistic instruments recorded 270 to 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W, and caddy can feel more secure than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degree UT.
The tactics that will be surprised by the tour companions are also pleasant to hear the admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club level (horizontal)."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit it on the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, you go to the right.I was originally doing a straight drum to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of tipping).
If the ball is not caught, it is at risk of slice, but "so the left side can be turned off."
It is a professional technique that you can not think of.

Original manuscript by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, which will be exhibited for the first time at the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall
The author Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA (1892-1927) obtained his own manuscript of his essay "Shokubun Bunshimura Memorial Hall" in Kita Ward, Tokyo by 27th, which he published in his last years, in which he fought literary theory with Junichiro TANIZAKI.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.
Although it was known that his essay was included in the whole collection, it was the first time that his manuscript was published publicly.
It is thought that he wrote it a few months before Akutagawa committed suicide, and Jo Tanei, a researcher at the memorial hall, said, "I can see how Akutagawa, who was debilitating both physically and mentally, faced serious literary difficulties with a tragic resolution."
A total of 12 essays containing 200 characters were published in the April 27 issue of Bungei Shunju.
Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Swedish environmental activist Greta Toonberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September.
While the speech has attracted attention, there has been a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
A political commentator on American television said Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and the international left," and the television station he used apologized.
In Japan, there are many reports online that comment on the part that is not the content of Mr. Greta's remarks, such as "I feel sorry for being used" "I should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
come up with all the lies and conspiracy theories you can think of.
Greta started writing, "You see, it started again, and as you know, those who dislike me are still active, chasing around my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from people, they come up with all the possible lies and conspiracy theories."
He pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seem to be distracting the issue.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time mocking and threatening teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I wonder if they feel threatened by us.
But don't spend your time paying more attention to them.
The world is starting to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
meet me on the street on friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, there were strikes on climate change in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta also called for a Friday of the 27th.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to extend to the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the putter was not good enough and I could not stretch.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after hitting the bogie at #4, the par 5 was left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of retaking it, the chip in eagle came at #6.
I was able to get a chance at No. 7, but I regret not being able to reach it in the second half.
what did you get here?
Recently (shots) didn't work well, so it was good that I could keep it firmly even on a narrow course.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the way to beat and the distance changed.
What is the difference?
(Smartphone, etc.) The place where camera shooting was possible.
I didn't care at all, but a lot of gallery people were filming videos.
There were not many other things that changed, but since there are few Japanese players in co-hosting the tournament, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
The second half of the race will continue from now on, but if you do not win more than one, you can not aim for the prize king, so I want to win another one, and there is also a ZOZO championship nearby, so I will try hard to get the qualification to enter the top in that tournament.
How do I prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetting things"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center We talked to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone may become dementia as they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we cannot expect a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as death from infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer death has decreased due to remarkable advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region, rather than being able to solve it by itself or family alone.
how to keep it to the level of forgetfulness
― Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "forgetting things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people with metabolic syndrome tend to become dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity are not available, and people living in environments where cooking is not possible can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you only have to look at TV vaguely, and you become disabled.
A similar situation could be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books everyday and think about things that are not metabolized.
