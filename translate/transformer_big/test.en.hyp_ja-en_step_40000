Driving in high heel is dangerous!
A number of young people's pedal mistakes have occurred - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
The number of times-by-year pedal mistake cases (2015 data from the Police Agency) showed that the number of incidents occurred at 1080, less than 24 years old, exceeding 1032 over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
This data does not indicate gender ratio or cause, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, there is a possibility that young people are distracted by other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, panps, sandals, mulles, and others drive as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people say it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people do not think about the possibility that they can lead to danger, and many people are driving without fear.
However, driving on high heels and sandals is in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that the operation should not be carried out to harm the person who is causing an accident.
The other is the Article 71 of the Public Security Committee, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural Public Security Commission, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Slipper, Tsukake, Hiheel, etc., footwear in a way that prevents operation, or does not drive vehicles (except light vehicles).
The purpose of each prefecture is to consider a violation of the operation of "a footwear that can prevent operation" even if not specified as a high-heel.
So why is it dangerous to drive in high heel?
It is obvious to consider the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe pedal operation, first place a foot or a foot on the floor, place a foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of the car's behavior.
However, it is difficult to adjust finely because the size of the foot on the pedal is smaller and the area surrounding the floor is smaller, and the area around the foot is smaller and it is difficult to adjust.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but the material is easy to pull if it is a heel or a heel, and when it comes to a sudden brake, the pedal is pulled by the heel, or the heel is pulled off and the heel is pulled off, and the heel is removed and the pedal is stuck in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal is not returned.

Regional industries in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki ceramics in the manufacture of "Awaji tiles" filed for quasi-self-insolved bankruptcy approximately 20 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo! News
It also affected the decline in housing prices and the rise in consumer roofs due to severe earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Code: 530173983, capital of 99.20 million yen, Otani 8881-8, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for the Kobe District Court on August 30.
He is a lawyer for the application, and is one of the other attorneys for the application.
The company was founded in June 1895 and was reorganized in April 1961.
Initially, the company started its business as a Ibushi tile maker, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishimitsu-cho, Mihara-gun (present-day Minami-Awaji City).
In October 1986, the company merged with Kyowa Kilngyo Co., Ltd., and succeeded in the Kinki Industrial Co., Ltd. business, but changed its name to the present Shosho and moved its main store to its present location.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was established.However, due to changes in consumer demand, western tiles such as flat plate tiles were produced at a rate of 30% of Japanese tiles, such as ibushi tiles.
The company established a wide range of sales bases in the center of western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, roof construction companies, and other companies.
It was known as the top tile manufacturer of Awaji Island.
However, due to the decline in housing prices since the Lehman shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Kumamoto Earthquake, etc., there was a growing demand for consumers.
In addition to the decline in interest rates due to the surge in fuel prices, the profit margins associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment resulted in a continuous deficit.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild the business by asking financial institutions to mitigate the repayment conditions of borrowings, but there was no signs of recovery in the business situation, and funds were gradually tightened.
I couldn't support it here, and I abandoned the business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 20 billion yen.

The possibility of the playoffs was extinguished, and the Cubs' Dalbisch pitcher (33) who finished the playoffs in this season reported that "There is nothing about the current state of mind about two days, but it is hard to see baseball (from bench) without any purpose."
At the end of the season, he started 31 games with 6 wins, 8 losses, 398 defenses, 178 throws 2/3 and 229 sacks.
Especially in the second half of the game, the ball form was stable, and he continued to play against the opponent with an outstanding spherical force and overwhelming power.
"I definitely didn't think it would be such a sensation at the age of 33, but I thought that spring was "I'm going to finish this again," but I feel that I can't believe that I could go back from there and go to a better place."
From early June, I was able to gradually respond.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased, and we can do it every day."
Although there was a trial and error, by challenging the hypothesis that he had established himself one after another, he became more and more successful.
"I was thrown into a list of injured people throughout the year."
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of the season, said, "I'm going to have to think about it now, I'm going to talk to my agent and family, but basically I'm not dissatisfied with this team, and it's fun."
The final conclusion is not clear, but the feeling is firm.

What is the image of the snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of the Baizu-no-bukuro work? - Yahoo! News
Is there anything in common with a mysterious beauty and a shadow?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and in August 2019, the Baizu-no-Omi Girl Collection (Genkosha), which focuses on the beauty girls drawn by Baizuko, known as the first person in the horror manga.
If you look at it with your hands, you will notice the correlation between beauty and fear of Baizu's works.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu-no-Oka's work
In the preface of "The Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence saying "There is a beauty of those who are in the opposite direction, such as fear, uglyness, shocking scenes and unfolding of stories," but because there is a contrast between the beautiful faces, the distortion of the face, the expression of the grudges that enveloped the grudge ...
There is a keyword "snacle" in many of the works that appear in Baizuba, but there are various types of people who see snakes as "a creepy creature" or those who feel "beauty."
Some people like reptiles in the world, but others say they don't really like it.
Thus, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, beauty and ugly creatures may be snakes.
Also, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is auspicious.
In the picture of the snake, there are "Tobi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Koiwa!."
It is the market for beauty that has a shadow.
In other words, can you say that it is a "cool buffet" type? ...I feel like it's common to girls who appear in Baizu's work.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Orochi Weekly Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be regarded as representative of Baizu's work, but it is reminiscent of a snake somewhere, such as deep sleep every 100 years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

There was no place for people to meet.
So there was a need for a regional exchange center for people and people to interact with.
It is also a place for multi-generation exchange, where elderly people participate.
It not only eliminates the isolation, but also leads to child care support and the health of the elderly.
They cut the chain of poverty and make the region healthy.
It's important to say, "I don't want to make children from there."
There are various places where meals are offered daily from one month to another.
The scale is varied from several to hundreds, from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere of the people who want to do it is getting started.
Its lowness is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes they hear issues such as a safe management system
"The connection between society becomes a safety net for disasters," Yuasa said.
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Aba Beer," which was used for this bombing, has improved dramatically by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that crashed.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, with a distance of about 1000 km.
To fly low air, it is also a strength that is difficult to catch radars."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization of Yemen "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that President Rohani is behind the Fusi faction, Iran, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make a profit in crude oil under circumstances where their country cannot export crude oil," said Sugawara, International Political Analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices increased by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock will come again.
"I would like to avoid military interventions until Trump's withdrawal from the Middle East, at least until the next year's election ends, and Iran will continue to bombard drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever," Sugawara said.
The U.S. and Iran's "proportionate war" are facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber became a regular employee.
(BizSPA!)
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use advertising for their own products, but there are companies that have started a rare system called "Youtuber adoption" which is employed by their employees.
Direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is the CEO of DmMiX and is the representative of the first company and staff of YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber's profession is a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are also entering the top ranking of career rankings that they want to become in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, we adopted young people chasing the dream of becoming a YouTuber and wanted to support them.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the job of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber is not able to make a profit as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, as well as creators who can not recognize the existence of YouTuber for their families.
In this effort, we will provide the creators with an environment for pay and content production.
At first, we hope to support our activities by supporting the benefits of the profession of YouTuber, which will become a unstable position.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State - Yahoo! News
"I hope Korea will reconsider its decision-making and return to Korea," said GOMIA, Japan-Korea Military Information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23, in response to an interview with the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for the U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan and Korea, the United States, and the United States, and the Republic of Korea.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper claims that "without GSOMIA, we cannot respond effectively to the crisis."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
"It is essential that the United States and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, will cooperate in alliances," he said.
In recent years, the deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interest."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

[The first half of the Bado Olympic race] World Champion Kenjito Momota and the strong Zhou Tensei lead one step forward!
Men's singles (Bad × Spice).
The Japan national team won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Badminton, Switzerland, in August, and finished the training camp in early September, and participated in the China OP (present-day State/Super1000).
Here, we will look back on the first half of the Tokyo Olympic Games that took place next year from May to August, and look forward to seeing men's singles for the mid-term battle (Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).
The Badminton Olympic Games began in May, and at the end of the World Championships, the top players competed in the Super 500 and more.
In the first half of the competition, Kento Momota, who won the 2nd prize in the 4th round, and Shutensei of Taiwan, were two people.
Momota won the World Championships, and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Rankings Championships, which are directly connected to the Olympic Games.
Momota also had JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ Results 16 Strong), JapanOP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championships were held, so fatigue would not be greater than the wartime period.
In the mid-September quarter, high-level competitions are expected to continue.
Taiwan's Ace is strong in the fight.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the top competition of Indonesia OP and ThailandOP (S500), has already competed in seven competitions.
In September, he joined the local Taipei OP (S300), winning the championship.
He is a very strong player who does not want to fight.
As the tournament continues, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning a high point in the first half.
It was an impression that Zhou Tensei was lacking in explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the play increased, allowing him to continue his good grades.
For Momota, the world's highest ranking, he seems to be a more serious opponent than ever.
In addition to the two players, he left the results in the first half of the game, but with the Thai young Ace Cantaphon and the Indian Cy Planetis B..
He is the third player of Unders Antonsen, who is fighting alone as a European force.
Although Cantafon did not enter the final at the top of the competition, he won the top prize in the second round, including entering the top four.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who could be able to rally against top players can be said to have a great potential to leap forward in the Olympic race.
Si Praneys B. also took a step away in India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Praneu H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who are late in injury, will also catch up in the future.
New rates for mobile phones Price reduction at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was introduced in response to the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it was generally closed.
Mr. Suga Yoshihide, Secretary of State, said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor in the fact that Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market is coming forward, and the observance of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to become an easy-to-use pricing system by fair competition.
I want to ask for their efforts.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminals, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize and half the terminal.
However, SIM locks can be used for 100 days by both companies.
NTT Docomo maximizes the number of terminal subscribers for only one third of its subscribers.
The three companies continue to "interpretation" to prevent transfer to other companies.
Regarding SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications decided to require immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the construction of a communication network such as the base station.
I was expected to be a competitive explosive, so I wore a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and fees of the full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want to work with responsibility.
This revision led to the remarks by the Secretary of State Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new fees of the three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to remain."
However, I don't think the government price reduction will ease the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out of the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount of money, while the terminal has issued advertisements such as "maximum half."
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users by companies, we must strive for a polite and easy-to-understand explanation.
Reducing the maximum amount of money to 500,000 yen, the cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
In Mie Prefecture, a three-disclosure deposit box (Karana triple credit deposit box, Kita Ise Ueno credit safe and Kikita credit deposit box) announced on September 26 that it was decided to reduce the amount of cash deposit by cash card to prevent damage from special fraud.
In the past three years, he holds a cash card in each of Kuwana Mie, Kita Ise Ueno, and Kikita's credit vaults.In the past three years, the maximum amount of cash card can be paid to depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a fixed amount of money at ATMs (automatic depositors).
On October 1, the Kuwana triple credit box and the Kita Ise Ueno credit box were lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and dark card numbers are stolen by ATMs, including financial institutions and police officials, and those involved in the credit safe are saying, "I want to protect your precious deposit in a way as much as possible."
He was transferred to Mutsu room including Yokotsuna Tsururyu.
In response to the death of Chikakata ITSUKI (Gensekiwawawaki hoko), the Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it approved the transfer to Mutsu room by three powerful samurai in the Itsuzu room of Yokotsuna Tsuruhashira and one on the floor.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Itsutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Oseki Kirishima), was from the Itsutsu room and was a brother of the late Itsutsuchika.
The Itsutsu Chikakata died suddenly on 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the mirror mountain room of the same gate, and future treatment was discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are ten Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu, and twelve sumo wrestlers at the time of autumn.
[ Rugby World Cup] A breakout and a fight against the U.S. player's face-to-face danger tackl" Overseas ripples "a insult and a cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
Flickle played a rough play in the United States, and former English representative, "It's not called tackle."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was the last time in 20 countries, and the United States finished 7-45 in England.
It became a black star, but in the latter half, the rough play played by F.C. Kyle called a ripple.
In the form of adding a shoulder tack to the opponent's face, he retired.
The actual scene was released with videos from overseas media, and former English athletes also complained that it was "an insult and a cowardly play" and "not called tackle."
[Video] "A insult and a cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by the U.S. representative kyle...
The fight was over one line.
It was 29 minutes later that I received at 0-38.
The English general Farrell, who was deeply hostile, had a balance when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tackle, but it was Kyle.
However, he had a higher body rather than a lower body from his waist, and had a strong body in his upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other, and the shape of the head is pierced.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
In a play that clearly lacked legitimacy, English players protested against Kyle.
Both players gathered at once, and the air was instantly touched.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle was dropped by a red card.
Bates followed the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby union player, is featured in the headlines " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in a poor play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrrell and became a retreat."
In the article, former English athletes introduced comments from the commentator Hugo Moña.
"It's an insult, a coward, not a tackle."It's a cowardly play."
The U.S., which had only one match, managed to escape the loss of the game in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left a bad taste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced on September 26 that it was the first hospital name of 424.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs examined the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are reorganised "standard funny."
In order to prevent the aging and expanding medical expenses, the hospital needs to be reorganized and integrated into a competitive hospital.
In October, the hospital asked for a full-scale review of reorganization and integration, and decided to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no forced force, the local chiefs and residents are expected to repulse from anxiety that the hospital is not nearby.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The hospital had a total of 29-1 percent of the total number of beds.
According to prefectures, Niigata (53,7 percent), Hokkaido (48,6 percent), Miyagi (47,5 percent), Yamaguchi (46,7 percent), Okayama (43,3%), and Okayama (43,3%).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals that can accommodate "acute period" for severe patients, and "acute period" for general surgery.
Nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, analyzed whether the competing hospital was located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need to publish the hospital's name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the group's population was 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in hospitals across the country to 1191,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute phase" and "acute period" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation for elderly people with high demand.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical plan" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country was divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discussed, many local residents and chiefs maintained their cautious stance, and discussions were difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to contribute to the revitalization of the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries ( Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo! News
On 27 September, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced the revision of the anti-defection guidelines to prevent the spread of the infection of livestock-infected disease "done" cholera.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is accepted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) etc., we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extracurricular distribution, such as meat, it is possible to avoid being certified by international organizations and affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan's status of cleanliness has been temporarily suspended.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The prefectural government creates a " vaccination program" that summarizes the scope of vaccination, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, have been raised as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines were revised, the region decided to review the situation very quickly.
Moves such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and omissions are generally limited to the region.
In terms of meat and processed goods, it is not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it effectively tolerates distribution outside the territory.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
In order to prevent the damage of the pigs, it is necessary to prevent the damage.
The revised guidelines were compiled at the meeting of experts held on the same day, and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, the prefectural government will implement an opinion inquiry and public comment until October 7 to implement a new protection guidelines.
A public approach to Motoda Keisuke and Manu!
"We don't need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57
As far as last year, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and Keisuke MF Honda, the former Japan national team, has been doing amazingly.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, was actually in the game?
the truth of the heavens is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th, Japan Time, said, "Please give an offer, but you don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, the world famous gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In the article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could seize in the crisis of the injury," five unincorporated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
In the United States, injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Martial, FW Marcus Rushford, etc. have been in an emergency.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Sullshire, is forced to slip 22 wins and 22 losses in the league, and has challenges in the quality of the front line.
Therefore, the Australian media named Honda as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Instead of strictly speaking strikers, Honda's contract as a creative side player can fill a hole filled with Andreas Perilla."
"The 33-year-old Honda, who is 33 years old, needs to take full attention from his entertainment management of Cambodian representatives."
What is the approach of Honda?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward due to the veterans who will play the Tokyo Olympic Games next year.

"PokeTalk" is a portable translation machine that lends free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on 26th that it had completed a total of 500 stores in Hamamatsu City, including a portable translation machine "Pocket Talk" at its membership office.
It is said that it will be the first time in Japan to deploy the same translator in a concentrated manner in the same area, and it is attracting attention that it will lead to improved inbound response capacity.
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city limits 60%.
The map app started to display loans to Google Maps, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" on smartphones was confirmed.
It is accessible from sites in the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.

Ikemura Kanyo, who is Naodra's name now, doesn't need to increase the first shot?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shots are not necessarily tipping.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique when you want to earn a distance such as the second round of per fifth.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of the ball being scattered, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
The professional age of 24 is 166 cm in height and is currently 7th in the driving stance division (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
At the beginning of spring, "I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I wanted to try Naodra."
From the practice round, you can draw and drop the ball over the grass in the Ti area, and you can also cut the ball over 1 W.
In the case of Big Carrie, it is necessary to use a lot of tiup, but both sides are used to make use of directra in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
It was recorded by Carrie from 270 yd to 280 yd.
"So I don't need 3W, so caddy can be more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cadi bag.
The second longest club is UT 17 degrees loft.
The battle method, which can be surprised by the tour companions, is also happy to hear the screams of leaking from the gallery you saw.
The trick is to "make the club a level ( horizontal).
"I can't fly straight even if I hit the top with a down blow.I'm going to the right with a cut track.I originally had a direct drag to correct the swinging of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
If the ball is not caught, it is accompanied by a risk of slice, "So the left side can be removed (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that I can't imagine.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the height of the first half, so I thought I could go by the momentum in the second half.
Did you see winning the 6th Eagle, 7th Bardy?
Even after I hit Boggy on the 4th, there was also a Per 5.
Even on the 7th, Bardy was caught and it was a chance, but it was regrettable that he did not reach the end of the second half.
what did you get at this tournament?
I didn't have a good shot recently, so I was glad that the fairway was able to keep the track firmly.
It was a course where the rough and the opposite sides were separated and the distance changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have any other changes, but since there were only a few Japanese players jointly, I came to the game with the desire to "not lose to overseas players."
We will continue in the second half of the war, but if we don't win more than one, we would like to win another, so there is also a ZOZO Championship at close proximity, so we will try to get the qualification to the top in that tournament.
What is the way to prevent dementia and keep things forgotten?
Interviewed and written by Yoko Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenge R&D, and are frustrated with dementia drugs.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it seems that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Prof. Toshisuke Otsuki talked about it.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in degree from mildness to severeness, and everyone can become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepegil, commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptations in some countries overseas, and the remarkable completion effect cannot be expected.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer while the deaths of infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and cancer deaths are declining due to the drastic advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment that can live safely in the community as a whole.
how to keep things down
- Are there people who are prone to dementia and are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and stay at the degree of " forgotten things."
dementia is considered one of the lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be more prone to people.
First, metabols tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the U.S., there are areas where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
It is not possible to use gas and electricity, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook in the first place are available.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and sugars.
In the end, poverty is becoming obese, but speaking of being obese, the TV is only blurred and the body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can also be Japan.
In addition, people who don't think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things from day to day.
