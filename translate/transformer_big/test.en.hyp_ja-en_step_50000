Driving in high heel is dangerous!
There are many incidents in which young people mistake pedaling - Yahoo! News
violation of road traffic law
The number of reported accidents caused by mishandling such as pedal mistakes is increasing, but it is a big mistake to think that it is only a problem for older drivers.
According to the National Police Agency data (2015), there are more than 1080 cases in the age of 24 years and 1032 cases over 75 years.
It is important to call attention to younger generations as well.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
This data does not indicate gender ratio or cause, but unlike the elderly who are thought to be due to the decline in the body such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, it is possible that young people are distracted by other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, mulles, and others drive as they are.
Some people know that it's not suitable for driving, but some people think it's troublesome to replace it, but some people do not think that it can lead to danger at all, and many people drive without fear.
However, driving in high-heel and sandals conflicts with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that the operation should not be carried out to harm the person causing an accident.
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.
It is similar to the intention of each prefecture to consider driving in " footwear that can prevent driving operation" even if not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, first put the foot on the floor and perpendicular to the brake pedal.When stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a branch.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of car behavior.
However, because the height of the heel and the angle of the foot are at the height of the heel, it is difficult to adjust finely without stepping firmly.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but the material is easy to pull, such as an emergency brake, when the heel is pulled and the pedal is not stepped, or the heel is pulled off, and the heel is removed from the beat, and the pedal is inserted into the back.
In addition, there are cases where heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal is not returned.

The local industry of Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics, manufactured by Awaji tile, filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 20 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
The decline in housing market and the frequent damage to the earthquake affected consumers' roofing.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Code: 530173983, capital of 99.20 million yen, Otani 8881-8, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for the Kobe District Court on August 30.

The company was founded in June 1895 and was reorganized in April 1961.
Initially, the company started its business as a Ibushi tile manufacturer, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishimitsu-cho, Mihara County (present-day Minamiawaji City).
In October 1986, the company merged the Kyowa Kiln Industry Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of the Kinki Industry Co., Ltd., but changed its name to the present Shogo and moved its main store to its present location.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the system was established in the present day.However, due to changes in consumer demand, Western tiles such as flat plate tiles were produced at a rate of 30% of Japanese tiles such as flat plate tiles.
The company established a wide range of sales bases in the center of western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, roof construction companies, and other companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand was sluggish due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
In addition to the decline in profits due to the rise in fuel prices, it was forced to carry out severe financial difficulties with excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild the business by asking financial institutions to ease the repayment conditions for borrowings, but there was no signs of recovery in the business situation, and it gradually began to raise funds.
I couldn't help but abandoned the business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 20 billion yen.

Dalbisch sums up this season, "It's good to make a difference in my life" (East SpoWeb) - Yahoo!
[From St. Louis 27 (28 Japan time) ]
The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished, and the Cubs' Dalbisch pitcher (33) who finished the playoffs in this season told us about the current state of mind: "It's hard to see baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
At the end of the season, he started 31 games with 6 wins, 8 losses, 3 98 defenses, 178 throws 2/3 and 229 steals.
Especially in the second half of the game, the ball form was stable, and he continued to play against the opponent with an overwhelming ball force.
I didn't think it would be such a feeling when I was 33 years old.In spring, I thought, "I'm going to finish doing this too, but I feel I can't believe that I came back from there and go to a better place."
From early June, I was able to gradually respond.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased and we can do it every day."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypothesis that I had established myself one after another, the condition increased significantly and the results were improved accordingly.
"I was thrown into the injured list throughout the year" also led to confidence.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt-out that can destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it now, I'm going to talk with agents and families, but basically I don't have any dissatisfaction with this team, and I'm happy."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

what about beauty and ugly?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu-no-Osaku? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between the mysterious beauty and the shadows?
Since the 1950s, a number of works have been sent to the world, and in August 2019, the Baizu Fuyuo Bi Girl Collection (Genkosha), which focuses on beautiful girls painted by Baizu Kazuo, known as the first person in the horror manga.
When you look at it with your hands, you will notice the correlation between beauty and fear of Baizu's works.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu-no-Osaku
In the preface of "The Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "There is the beauty of the women who are in the opposite direction, such as fear, uglyness, and shocking scenes and unfolding of the story."
There is a keyword "single" in many of the works that appear in Baizu-no-Oka, but there are a variety of people who see snakes as " creepy creatures" or who feel "beauty."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others say they don't like it.
Thus, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, beauty and ugly creatures may be snakes.
Also, since ancient times, this creature has been worshipped as a living creature with high spiritual power.
In the picture of the snake, there are "Tobi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Koiwai!."
Generally, it is the market for beautiful women who have a shadow to become a woman.
In other words, can you say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ...I feel like it is common in the beauty girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in the Weekly Shonen Sunday since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work.

Makoto Yuasa, chairman of the NPO, and social activist, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely, and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So there was a demand for exchange centers in areas where people and people interact.
It is also a place for multi-generational exchange, where elderly people participate in the "Nyogo Shokudo."
It not only eliminates the solitary diet, but also leads to support child rearing and the health of the elderly.
They cut the chain of poverty and boost the region.
It's important to say, "Don't make children from there."
There are various places to offer meals every day from the beginning of the month.
The scale is varied from several to hundreds, and the venue is diverse from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere of people who want to do it is getting started.
Its lowness is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes they hear issues such as a safe management system
Despite this, Yuasa says, "By interacting with many people, values change."
It seems like the hope of the closure society.

"Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that crashed in recent years.
It can be manufactured at low cost, with a distance of about 1000 km.
It is also the strength that it is difficult to catch radars in order to fly low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, led by President Rohani, and it is impossible for Iran to allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make a profit in crude oil under circumstances where their country cannot export crude oil," said Sugawara, international political analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock is coming again.
"I don't want to avoid military interventions until at least next year's elections are over, and Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "signal war" are facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber, a super personality, became a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me (biz SPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use advertising for their own products, but there are companies that started a rare system called "Youtuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct Marketing Mix (DmMiX) is a direct marketing mix of companies' CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative of Staff First, a subsidiary that YouTuber has adopted, listened to the story.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber's profession is a longing for many young people.
In the career rankings where elementary school students want to work in the future, there will be more and more young people aiming for the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, we want to adopt and support young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber.
But why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber is not able to earn revenue as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, as well as creators who don't allow their families to recognize YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide the creators with an environment for pay and content production.
At first, we would like to support our activities by supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State - Yahoo!
U.S. Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Napper said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return its decision on the Japan-Korea Military Information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA) which expires on November 23 in response to a single interview by the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for senior US officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information and other information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argues that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
"There is time to expire," he urged South Korea to return.
"It is essential that the United States and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, cooperate in alliance relations," said Nakaro, the first in history to recognize the threat of joint flight training conducted in July over the Sea of Japan.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out to be "damaged by U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

The deadline is until October 25.
"The heart of Fukui, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud of all over the country.
Through the picture book, I want to convey the true kindness and compassion that children have inherited over time."

Taiwan's Aces are strong in the series.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), has already competed in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300), winning the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
As the tournament continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
It was an impression that Zhou Tensei lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the play increased, allowing him to continue his good grades.
For Momota, the world's top ranked number one, it seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, he left the game in the first half, with a young Thai ace Cantaphon and Indian Cyplanes B.
He is the third player of Unders Antonsen, who is fighting alone in Europe.
Although Cantafon did not enter the finals at the top of the competition, he had the ability to advance to the top level, including entering the best four in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who could be able to rally against top players can be said to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step away in India, where he was a good player for singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been delayed due to injury, will catch up in the future.
New rates for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was announced as part of the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it remained relatively high.
Mr. Suga Yoshihide, Secretary of State, said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor in the fact that the full-scale entry into Rakuten has been postponed and the oligarchy of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to become an easy-to-use pricing system by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminals, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half.
However, SIM locks can be used for 100 days by both companies.
NTT Docomo will make the terminal number one-third for only the contractor on its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfer to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was because the maintenance of the communication network such as the base station did not proceed as planned.
As I was expected to be a competitive explosive, I was wearing a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and rates of full-scale service are not revealed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work with responsibility.
This revision led to the remarks by the Secretary of State Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think that it will be good."
However, I don't think the government price reduction will ease the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it comes out of the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half, while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users by companies themselves, we must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations.
A cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three credit safes in Mie Prefecture (Karana Mie Sankin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kikita Shinkin Bank) announced on July 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of cash card withdrawal limit to prevent damage from special scams.
In the past three years, a cash card for depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs (automatic depositors) will be issued on a cash card of 500,000 yen.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita Ise Kozuke Shinkin Bank cut down from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions and police officials, and the parties involved in the credit safe are saying, "I want to protect your precious deposit in the way possible."

In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers from 10 Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] Outbreak & Scratch Overseas ripples "An insult and poor play" - Yahoo! News
Flickil in the United States plays rough, former English representative, "Don't call tackl."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was the last tournament in 20 countries, and the United States finished 7-45 in England.
A black star was launched, but Lafplay, played by FL John Quill in the latter half, called a ripple.
In the form of adding shoulder tackles to the face of the opponent, he left.
The actual scene was released with videos from overseas media, and former English players also complained that it was "a insult and poor play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "An insult and a cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by the US representative kyle...
A hot fight crossed the line.
It was 29 minutes later when I arrived at 0-38.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply hostile, fell in balance when he caught his side's path.
It was Kyle who went to Tackle.
However, he took up the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and hit the body violently.
As a result, the opponent's head and head are in contact with each other's head and face.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against a play that clearly lacked legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and the air was instantly touched.
As a result of TMO (video decision), Kyle leaves with a red card.
After a pitch with a bad face, some of the audience asked for a fair play and some booing.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby union player, is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrel, and was dropped."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's an insult, a coward, not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the final defeat.
However, Kyle's play left a bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first 424 hospital names in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, which determined that there was little clinical experience.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the treatment performance of 14 public and public hospitals.
the four hospitals that are reorganised
In order to curb the aging and expanding medical expenses, it was necessary to promote the reorganization and integration of hospitals in the competitive area.
In October, we request a full-fledged review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no forced force, the local chiefs and residents are expected to repulse due to anxiety about the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29-1 percent, and the number of beds was relatively small.
By prefecture, the proportion was high in the order of Niigata (53-7%), Hokkaido (48-6%), Miyagi (47-5%), Yamaguchi (46-7%), Okayama (43-3%).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals that can accommodate "higher acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need to publish the hospital's name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds to 1191,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute phase" and "acute period" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation for elderly people with high needs.
To cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical plan" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country was divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discussed it, many local residents and chiefs maintained their cautious stance, and discussions were difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
General training for disaster prevention, such as the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komake, the path, etc.
On September 27, the comprehensive disaster prevention training, which assumed the eruption of Mt. Komaketake (1131 m), took place in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Toshima tube.
Approximately 400 people, including 20 staff and residents, participated in the event.
Since the Hokkaido Kokomaketake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August, the first meeting was held.
It was the first time in 18 years that residents participated in a wide-area training.
It is assumed that Mt.Komaketake erupted at 8:45 AM and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the storm warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in Mori and Nanai-cho, and residents moved by busses and police vehicles prepared by each town.

About 100,000 citizens, including students who sympathized with the 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall to Canbybridge and from downtown libraries.
Before the city hall of the meeting place, people with plastic cards began to gather for hours before the start, and at 13 o'clock at the start time, the number of people to fill the road in front of the city hall.
As a result, more than 100,000 people participated.
In the middle of the road, the police cooperated with the road regulations, and watched over the course of a few hours until all people walked.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York City, Vancouver has held numerous events to consider global warming from the last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the rest of the day school said, "I want to protect the earth even if I rest the important thing of the school," and many adults who took part in the work rest responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo!
On 27 September, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "porks" in livestock infection.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is unlikely to be a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been temporarily suspended.
In the revision, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up a "Recommended Area for Vaccines" based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The prefectural government creates a "vaccinated vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga, have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will make an extremely clear decision.
Moves such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and evasion are limited in principle to the region.
In terms of meat and processed goods, it is not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it effectively tolerates distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
In order to prevent the damage caused by harmful rumors, he also appealed to the safety of the inoculated pigs.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, the prefectural government will conduct an inquiry and public comments until October 7 to implement a new protection guidelines.
Keisuke Honda, who belongs to the company, is a public approach to Man U!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat.) 2:57
As of last year, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A. League, and currently his former Japan national team, Mr. Keisuke MF Honda, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth is.
Honda, who has updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th, Japan Time, said, "Please give an offer, but you don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, the world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In the article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could seize in the crisis of the ensuing injury," five unincorporated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
Currently, United has been suffering from injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Sullshar, is forced to slip 22 wins and 22 losses in the league, and is facing the quality of the front line.
Therefore, the Australian media named Honda as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Instead of strictly speaking strikers, Honda's contract as a creative side player can fill a hole in Andreas Perilla."
"The 33-year-old Honda, who is 33 years old, needs to get full attention from his entertainment management of Cambodian representatives."
What is the approach of Honda?
It is also noteworthy that United will move as a result of the veterans who will play the Tokyo Olympic Games next year.
Complete installation of 500 mobile translators Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
"PokeTalk" is a portable translation machine that lends free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu city.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on July 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 units in stores and other locations in Hamamatsu City.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the same translation machine in a centralized manner in the same region, and it is noteworthy that it will lead to improved inbound response capacity.
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" started to show lending destinations, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" on smartphones was confirmed.
It is accessible from sites in the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free rental of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city with the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce purchased 500 units and leased them for two years to small and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as the acquisition of hospitality certification and the introduction of cashless payments.
The representatives of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want to connect with the development of new foreign customers while the business environment is severe."
now, don't you need to tie up your first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1 W shot is not always tipping.
When you want to earn a distance by hitting the second of the per fifth, you can hit the ball on the ground, and there is also the so-called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of scattering balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
The age of 24 in the professional seventh year is 166 cm in height and is currently 7th in the driving stance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
At the beginning of spring, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I wanted to try it again."
From the practice round, you can draw and drop the ball over the grass in the Ti area, or even swing 1W.
In the case of Big Carrie, it is necessary to use a lot of tiup, but both sides make use of direct drag in narrow halls and so on.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd with Carrie.
"So I don't need 3W, and Cady can be more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cadi bag.
The second longest club is UT 17 degrees loft.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration that leak from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club horizontally."
"I can't fly straight even if I hit the top with a down blow.I'm going to the right with a cut track.I originally had a direct drag to correct the swinging of 1W shots (at the time of ticking).
If the ball is not caught, it is accompanied by a risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that you can't imagine.

The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published at the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall.
The author Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) wrote a self-publish manuscript of his essay "Shoku literary, too literary," which he published in his last years of fighting literature with Junichiro Tanizaki, and the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall in Kita Ward, Tokyo was acquired by 27 days.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.
Although it was known that his essays were included in the whole collection, it was the first time that his manuscript was published publicly.
It is said that he wrote a few months before Akutagawa committed suicide, and the museum researcher, Jo Isai, said, "It can be seen that Akutagawa, who had fallen physically and mentally, faced serious problems with literature, with great determination."
A total of 12 essays were published in the April 27 issue of "The Spring of Literature."
Greta Toonbeli: "Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?"
Greta Tonberg, a Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, it has been reported to insult Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?
Political critics said that Greta was " mentally ill" on American television programs, and that it was used by parents and international leftists, and the television stations that used him apologized.
In Japan, there are many reports on Mr. Greta, such as "It is used and cute."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter, saying, "Why do people use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with lies and conspiracy theories as far as i can think.
Mr. Greta said, "Look, it started again, and as you realize, those who hate me are still active; they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm different from people; they come to think of as far as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, but that they seemed to be distracting from the issue of the story.
I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
It would be another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened with us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
They don't like it, they don't like it.
Come to see you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20 the previous week, there were strikes on climate change in New York and elsewhere.

Other than that, there was not much change, but since there were only a few Japanese players jointly, I came to the game with the feeling that I would not lose to overseas players.
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win more than one, you don't want to aim for the winner.
What is the way to prevent dementia and keep things forgotten?
Interviewed and written by Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenge R&D and are frustrated with dementia drugs.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it seems that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Professor Toshisuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There may be differences between mildness and severity, but everyone can become dementia when age is over.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepegil, commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and it is not possible to expect significant completion effects.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer while the death of infectious diseases and accidents is decreasing, and cancer death is declining due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to create an environment where society can live with peace of mind as a whole.
how to keep things down
- Are there people who are prone to dementia and are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable that you become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of forgetting things.
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle diseases and tends to be easier for people.
First, metabols tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used.
After eating less vegetables and protein, it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and sugars.
In the end, poverty becomes obese, but when you talk about it, you can barely see TV, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things from day to day.
