Driving in high heels is dangerous!
A number of accidents involving young people taking pedals - Yahoo! News
violation of road traffic law
The number of reports on accidents caused by mishandling such as pedal mistakes is increasing, but it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases are under 24 years old and 1032 cases are over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
do you take your feet?
are you safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that young people are distracted by other things such as music and conversation, and they may be mistaken for clothes.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on their high heels, pamps, sandals, mulles, and clothes on the day and drive as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people don't think that it can lead to danger at all, and many people drive without fear.
However, driving in high-heel and sandals violates road traffic law.
The first is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brake and other operations, Article 70 of which stipulates that "the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.For example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, there is a statement that the driver shall not drive the vehicle (excluding light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by preventing driving operations.
The purpose of each prefecture is to consider the operation as a violation of " footwear that can prevent operation" even if it is not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving in the high heel dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, first put the foot on the floor, then perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right as a branch when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of car behavior.
However, in high-heel, the area where kato is grounded on the floor is small, always blaming with gravure, and because the height of the heel has an angle to the entire foot, the area of the foot where the pedal is ground is smaller and the fine adjustment is difficult.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but the material is easy to pull, such as a high heel, and when it comes to a sudden brake, the pedals are pulled by the heel, and the heel is removed from the beat, and the heel is stuck in the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal is not returned.

In the local industry of Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki ceramics manufactured by "Awaji tiles" filed for quasi-self-insolved debts of about 20 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo! News
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the severe damage caused by the earthquake.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Code: 530173983, capital of 920 million yen, Otani 8881-8, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for bankruptcy on August 30.
One of the applicant's attorneys was Masaru Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and one other lawyer.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
Initially, the company started its business as a Ibushi tile manufacturer in Nishitan-cho, Mihara-gun (present Minami-Awaji City), a local industry in Awaji Island.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged with Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd., succeeded the business of Kinki Industry Co., Ltd., and changed its name to present Shogo and moved its main store to its present location.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current structure was based on Ibushi tiles, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western tiles such as flat plate tiles were produced at a rate of 70 percent, and Ibushi tiles were produced at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases in the center of western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, roof construction companies, etc.
It was well known as Awaji Island's top tile manufacturer.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock, and the damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, the demand for tiled roofs has been sluggish, and demand has been sluggish.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, excess interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment resulted in a continuous deficit, which forced severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild the business by requesting financial institutions to ease the repayment conditions of borrowings, but there was no signs of recovery in the business situation, and it gradually began to raise funds.
He was unable to support the project and gave up his business continuity.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 20 billion yen.

what about beauty and ugly?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu-no-Osaku? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between mystical beauty and shadow expression?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and the Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection (Genkosha) was launched in August 2019.
When I look at it with my hands, I once again realize the correlation between beauty and fear of Baizu's works.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu-no-Osaku
In the preface of "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "we can stand out with the beauty of the women who are in the opposite direction, such as fear, uglyness, shocking scenes and unfolding of the story."
There is a keyword "shade" in many of the works that appear in Baizu-no-Oka, but there are a variety of people who see snakes as " creepy creatures" or who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, but others don't like it.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
Also, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times.
There is a Baizu work on the theme of the snake, "Tobi Girl" and "Later Girl" in 1965.
Generally, it is the market for beautiful women who have a shadow to become "Nabi-nyo."
In other words, can you say that it is a "cool beauty" type ... that seems to be the commonality of beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Shonen Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work, but it is reminiscent of a snake somewhere, such as deep sleep every 100 years to preserve eternal life and eternal youth.

Deputy Minister Yamamoto, Deleting Diet Tweets The night before the helicopter crash | Shizuoka Shimbun
Mr. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, posted a comment with a photo of Kazuchika Iwata, and deleted a Twitter screen.
Mr. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, deleted his Twitter comments by 27 days when he ate at Yakitoriya in Saga Prefecture.
Mr. Yamamoto entered the prefecture on February 26 to explain the results of the accident that the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's AH64D Combat Helicopter crashed in the city of Kanzaki.
That night, I went to Saga Prefecture on a business trip!
I posted a comment with a photo of Kazuchika Iwata, Minister for Defense of the same prefecture who attended the meal.
In the accident, a girl in a house was injured and two men were killed.
The Yamamoto clan was elected four times in the House of Representatives, and was elected in proportionally to the Southern Kanto region.
[Etsuyama Wakamizu] Children's Shokudo, which offers free or inexpensive meals for children, is spreading throughout the country.
According to research conducted by NPOs and other organizations, around 3700 sites are active in Japan this year.
It has increased by one to six times compared to 2018 and has increased to nine locations in Fukui Prefecture last year.
why is it now?
Makoto Yuasa, chairman of the NPO, and social activist, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So there was a demand for exchange centers in areas where people and people interact.
It is a place for multi-generational exchanges that elderly people also participate in.
It not only eliminates solitary food, but also helps to raise children and improve the health of the elderly.
It cuts the chain of poverty and promotes the region.
The important thing is, "Don't make children from there."
There are a variety of places where meals are served daily from one month to another.
The venue is diverse from several to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
It is becoming an atmosphere where people who want to do something can do.
The lowness of the threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
i've heard about issues like a secure management system.
Despite this, Yuasa says, "By engaging with a lot of people, values change."
It seems like the hope of a closed society.

The real culprit who attacked Saudi oil facilities "- Yahoo! News
"Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that crashed in recent years.
It can be manufactured at low cost, and has a length of about 1000 km.
It is also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars in order to fly low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization of Yemen "Fusi" issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran, behind the Fusi faction, is Iran, led by President Rohani, who cannot export crude oil, cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make crude oil, and if Iran continues to take oil embargo measures, it will be aimed at informing the international community of pain in response."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock is coming again.
"I don't want to avoid military interventions until at least next year's elections are overshadowed by Trump's official withdrawal from the Middle East," said Mr. Sugawara, "I know that Iran will continue to bomb drones in hiding the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "signal war" are facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber has become a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their own products, some companies have started a unique system called "YouTuber Adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative of Staff First, a subsidiary adopted by YouTuber, spoke to me.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now, YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
In the career rankings where elementary school students want to work in the future, there will be more and more young people aiming for the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, we want to adopt and support young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, most YouTuber is not able to earn the revenue they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who don't allow their families to recognize YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide the creators with an environment for salary and content production.
At first, we hope to support our activities by supporting the demerit of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" - Yahoo! News
U.S. Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Napper (Korea and Japan) said on November 27 that the Japan-Korea Military Information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23, would like Korea to reconsider and return its decision.
It is unusual for senior US officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information and other information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot respond effectively to the crisis."
"There is time to expire," he urged South Korea to return.
"It is essential that the United States and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, will cooperate in alliances," he said.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

This is a feature that treats iPad as a sub-display on your Mac, and it was previously realized in a third-party app.
And Sidecar is Apple's pure function, so it is expected that it is better with more completeness (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I would like to fully experience the next generation of macOS.

The tournament will be held in May at the Sdirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/The results are 16 strong), JapanOP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only the World Championships were held, so fatigue would not be greater than the wartime.
In the middle of September, high-level competitions will be held continuously.
Taiwan's Ace is strong in fighting.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300), winning the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
It was an impression that Shutensei was lacking in explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the play increased so that he could continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, it seems to be more difficult than ever.
Apart from these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cyplanes B.
And the three of them are Unders Antonsen, who is fighting alone in Europe.
Although Cantafon did not enter the finals at the top of the competition, he was able to advance to the top in the second round, including entering the top four.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on the 18th) who was able to rally against top players can be said to have a lot of potential for a leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step back in India, where he was a good player for singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, will also catch up in the future.
New rates for mobile phones Price reductions in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was issued following the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it almost stopped.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide said last summer, "There is room to lower about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, price competition did not occur.
This is a major factor in the fact that the full-scale entry into Rakuten has been postponed and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to become an easy-to-use pricing system by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts on terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminals, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half.
However, both companies have a "SIM Lock" device that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will make the terminal number up to one third for only its subscribers.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of the SIM lock.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was because the maintenance of the communication network such as the base station did not proceed as planned.
I was expected to be a detonator for the price reduction competition, so I was wearing a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and rates of full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for the business.
This revision led to the remarks by the Secretary of State Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay."
However, I don't think the government price reduction will ease the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it comes out of the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that the terminal advertises such as "maximum half" but there is a case where the burden of consumers exceeds half.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations.
Lowering the withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen Cash Card for 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
The three credit banks in Mie Prefecture (Kumana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kikita Shinkin Bank) announced on July 26 that they decided to reduce their withdrawal limit by cash card to prevent damage from special fraud.
In the past three years, the bank has a cash card in each of Kuwana Mie, Kita Ise Ueno, and Kikita's credit vaults, with a limit of 500,000 yen for depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs.
The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be reduced from October 1 to November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions and police personnel, etc., and those in the credit vaults "I want to protect your important deposits in the best possible way."
After the sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Yokotsuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun
On the 27th, the Japan Sumo Association announced that, following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwawawaki hoko), three sumo wrestlers in the Izu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNA and one person in Hitoyama approved the transfer to Mutsu.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Itsutsu room.

Itsuchika ITSUTSU died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same room of Kagamiyama, and the treatment was discussed in the future.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers, including 10 Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] Departures & Struggles Overseas ripples on the U.S. player's face risk tackle - Yahoo! News
Flickil in the United States played rough, former England representative, "It's not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was the last tournament in 20 countries to be played in the United States at 7-45.
It became a black star, but in the latter half of the play, the rough play played by Flion Kyle, called a ripple.
In the form of adding shoulder tackles to the face of the opponent, he left.
The actual scene was released with video and foreign media, and former English players were bitterly accused of being "a insult and cowardly play" and not "a tackle."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill
A hot fight broke out.
It was 29 minutes later when I arrived at 0-38.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply in the enemy, had a balance when catching his side's path.
It was Kyle who went to Tuckle.
However, he took up the upper body rather than the lower body from his waist and hit the upper body hard.
As a result, the opponent's head and head are in contact with each other's head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
English players protested against a play that clearly lacked legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an air immediately.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with Red Card.
After a pitch with a bad face, some of the audience asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby player, is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and he dropped out."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Moña, a former English player.
"It's an insult, a coward, not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S., which had only one match, managed to escape the defeat in the 81st minute attempt.
However, Kyle's play left a bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first 424 hospitals in 1455, including public hospitals in Japan, and public hospitals in Japan such as Nika.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare verified the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.
four hospitals that are subject to reorganization
In order to reduce medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital and decided to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no forced force, the local chiefs and residents are expected to repulse due to anxiety about the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total number of hospitals was 29-1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was high in the order of Niigata (53-7%), Hokkaido (48-6%), Miyagi (47-5%), Yamaguchi (46-7%), Okayama (43-3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals that can respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
They analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the necessity of publicizing hospitals.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals to 1,191,000 in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds for "high-altitude acute" and "acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are taken, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation for elderly people with high needs.
To cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical plan" which stipulates the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, municipalities and medical officials have been consulted, many local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to contribute to the revitalization of the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention such as the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komake, the path, etc.
On September 27, the General Training for Disaster Risk Reduction, which assumed the eruption of Mt.Komake (1131 meters), took place in the forest, Nanae and Kabe-cho in the Toshima Kan.
Approximately 400 people from 20 organizations including roads and three towns participated.
It was the first event since the Hokkaido Komaketake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan with evacuation routes in August.
It was the first time in 18 years that local residents participated in extensive training.
At 8:45 p.m., Mt.Komaketake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the storm warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in Mori and Nanai-cho, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.
100,000 students protest against school break global warming in Vancouver - Yahoo! News
About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with the 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to protest climate change.
Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall to Canby Bridge and from downtown libraries.
Before the city hall of the meeting place, people with plastic cards began to gather for hours before the start, and at 13 o'clock at the start time, the number of people to fill the road in front of the city hall.
After that, the number of participants continued to increase and eventually more than 100,000 people participated.
In the middle of the road, the police also cooperated with the road regulations, and watched all people for hours until they finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York City, Vancouver has held many events to think about global warming from the last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school on this day complained to the adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I rest on something important to the school," and many adults who took part in the work rest responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo!
On 27 September, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Tonn cholera" in livestock infections.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial circulation such as meat, it is unlikely that it will become a "clean country" certified by international organizations and will affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been temporarily suspended.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "Recommended Area for Vaccination" based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccinated vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will make a very clear decision.
Moves such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and omissions are restricted in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed goods, it is not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
They are responsible for the safety of the inoculated pigs and also to prevent harmful rumors.
The amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Headquarters.
In the future, we will carry out inquiries to prefectures and public comments until October 7 to implement new anti-defection guidelines.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, a public approach to Man U!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat.) 2:57
As of last year, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A. League, and now his former Japan national team, MF Honda Keisuke, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth of the heavens is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th, Japan Time, said, "Please give us an offer, you don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could seize in the crisis of injury, five unincorporated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshar, is forced to slip into the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faces challenges in the quality of the front line.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Not strictly a striker, Honda's contract as a creative side player can fill a hole filled with Andreas Perilla."
Although 9 goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," it is pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention from his entertainment management of Cambodian representatives."
Is the Honda approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move as a result of the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Complete installation of 500 portable translators Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
PokeTalk, a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on July 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translators, PokeTalk, to stores in Hamamatsu City, for free.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a centralized manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will lead to improved inbound response.
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" started to show rentals, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" was shown on smartphones.
It is accessible from sites in the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free rental of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city with the declaration of Hamamatsu, the largest inbound support city in Japan.
The Chamber of Commerce purchased 500 units and lent them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as acquisition of hospitality certification and introduction of cashless payments.
The representatives of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want to connect with the development of new foreign customers while the business environment is severe."
Now, Naodora's famous person, Kanyo IKEMURA doesn't need to increase the first shot?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not always tipping.
There is also the so-called "Dynadra" technique when you want to earn a distance in the second round of par 5.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of scattering balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
The age of 24 in the professional seventh year is 166 cm in height and is currently 7th in the driving stance category (average 304.02 yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
"I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot before spring, so I thought I would try Naodora."
From the practice round, draw and drop the ball over the grass in the Ti area, and sometimes swing 1W.
In the case of Big Carey, it is used to increase the number of tithes, but both sides are used to make use of direct drag in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd with a carrie.
"So I don't need 3W, and Cady can be more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cady Bag.
The second longest club is the UT at Loft 17 degrees.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club horizontally."
"Even with a down blow, you can't fly straight, even if you hit the upper.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I originally had a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tiup).
If the ball is not caught, it is accompanied by a risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that you can't imagine.

The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published at the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall.
The author Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) wrote a manuscript of his essay "Shoku literary, too literary," which he published in his last years of fighting literature with Junichiro Tanizaki, and the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall in Kita Ward, Tokyo was acquired by 27 days.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.
Although it was known that his essays were included in the whole collection, it was the first time that his manuscript was published publicly.
It is said that he wrote a few months before Akutagawa committed suicide, and the museum researcher, Takeshi Isai, said, "I can see that Akutagawa, who had fallen physically and mentally, faced serious problems with literature with a tragic determination."
A total of 12 essays were published in the April 27 issue of "Ryushu Shunshu."
Greta Tounbeli: "Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?"
Greta Tonberg, a Swedish environmental activist who gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech has attracted attention, it has been reported to insult Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?
Political critics said that Greta was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing" on American television shows, and the television station that he used apologized.
In Japan, there are many reports on Greta's comments, such as "It is used and cute" "You should go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do the adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with lies and conspiracy theories as far as i can think.
Mr. Greta said, "Look, it started, and as you realize, those who hate me are still active, as I look, my clothes, my attitude, and I follow different places, they come to think of as far as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seemed to be distracting from the issue.
I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
That time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if people like that change, they don't like it.
Let's meet on the street on Friday!

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the height of the first half, so I thought I could go by that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not able to stretch well.
did you see the sixth eagle, seventh bardy?
Even after I hit Boggy on the 4th, there was also a Per 5 left, so if I were doing it with the feeling of returning, the Chip In Eagle came out on the 6th.
Even on the 7th, Bardy was able to take the opportunity, but I regret that I didn't reach it in the second half.
did you get it?
Since I haven't been in good condition recently (Shots), I was glad that the fairway was able to work well in narrow courses.
It was a course where roughs, fronts and backs were separated and the distance changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
(Smartphones, etc.) It was possible to shoot a camera.
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have much else to change, but since there were only a few Japanese players in the tournament jointly, I came to the game with the desire to "do not lose to overseas players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win one or more, don't want to aim for the winning king, so I would like to win another.
What is the way to prevent dementia and keep things forgotten?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenge R&D and are frustrated with dementia drugs.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it seems that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Professor Toshisuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: There is a difference in degree from mildness to severeness.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug Donepegil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and it is not possible to expect significant completion effects.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are decreasing due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem with the individual or family, but it is necessary to create an environment where society can live with peace of mind as a whole.
how to keep things down
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable that you become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of forgetting things.
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle diseases and tends to be easier for people.
First, metabols tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used.
After eating less vegetables and protein, it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and sugars.
In the end, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and speaking of doing things, you can barely see TVs, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and who do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things from day to day.
