Driving in high heels is dangerous!
There are many accidents involving young people taking pedals - Yahoo!
violation of road traffic law
The number of reports on accidents caused by mishandling such as pedal mistakes is increasing, but it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the data from the National Police Agency in 2015, the number of accidents involving pedals by age is 1080, more than 24 years old, exceeding 1032 over 75 years old.
It is important for young people to call attention the same way.
do you take your feet?
are you safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, young people may be distracted by other things such as music and conversation, or they may be misstepped by clothes.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on their high heels, pamps, sandals and mulles, and they drive as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think that it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people don't think about the possibility that leads to danger at all, and many people drive without fear.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that "the operation should not be done to harm the person who causes an accident."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.
It is similar to the intention of each prefecture to consider driving as a violation of "a footwear that could prevent operation" even if it does not specify a high heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe and secure pedal operation, the foot is fixed first on the floor, and the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the foot is tilted to the right as a starting point.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed, regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the area where the kato is grounded on the floor is small, and always the gravure is broken, and because the height of the heel has an angle to the entire leg, the area of the foot where the pedal is ground is smaller and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull, and when it comes to sudden braking, the heels are pulled and the pedals cannot be stepped, or the heels are removed in the time when the heels are pulled and the heels are stuck in the back of the pedals.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

In the local industry of Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki ceramics manufactured by "Awaji tiles" filed for quasi-self-insolved debts of approximately 20 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
It was also affected by the decline in housing prices and the rise in consumer roofs due to the frequent earthquake and tsunami.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Code: 530173983, capital of 92.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for bankruptcy on August 30.
The applicant is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture) and one other attorney.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present-day Minami-Awaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Industry Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged with Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Industry Co., Ltd., but at the same time, the head office was relocated to its present location after the change to the current business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was based on Ibushi tiles, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western tiles such as flat plate tiles were produced at a rate of 70 percent and Ibushi tiles were produced at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases centered in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, roof construction companies, and other companies.
He was known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand was sluggish due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in the profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit with excessive interest-bearing liabilities associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make severe financial arrangements.
For this reason, the Bank tried to rebuild the business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, but there was no signs of recovery in the business situation, and the financial situation gradually began to tighten.
I couldn't help but quit the business and decided to take this action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

Especially in the second half of the game, the ball form was stable, and he continued to play the opponent with an outstanding braking force and overwhelming ball force.

what is beauty and ugly?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between mystical beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When you look at it with your hands, you will notice the correlation between beauty and fear of your work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "we can stand out because of the beauty of the women who have both fear, uglyness, and shocking scenes and developments of the story."
There is a keyword "snake" in many of his works, but there are many people who see snakes as "a creepy creature" or who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, but others don't like it.
In such a way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
Also, this creature has been worshipped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is good luck.
In a painting about the snake, there are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
The market is for beautiful women with shadows.
In other words, can you say that it is a "cool beauty" type ... that seems to be the commonality of beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which has been serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work.

As of 2018, it has increased by one to six times, and in Fukui Prefecture, it has increased by nine places compared to last year.

Makoto Yuasa, chairman and social activist of the NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely, and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So, there was a need for a regional exchange center where people and people interact.
It is a place for multi-generational exchanges that elderly people also participate in.
It not only eliminates orphans, but also helps raise children and improve the health of elderly people.
It cuts the chain of poverty and promotes the region.
What's important is, "Don't make a child that's coming from there."
There are various places to offer meals every day from the beginning of the month.
There are a wide variety of venues, from several to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere of the people who want to do it is being created.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
i've heard about issues such as safe management
Even though it is the yōgo, "Changes in values by interacting with many people" Yuasa says, "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in the event of disasters.
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

The real culprit who attacked Saudi oil facilities "- Yahoo! News
"Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that have crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost, with a range of about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars in order to fly low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization of Yemen "Fusi" issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, as President Rouhani cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil in a situation where its own country cannot export crude oil, and if it continues to embargo crude oil against Iran, it is aimed at informing the international community that the pain will accompany it."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over, and Iran will continue to bomb drones in hiding the Fusi, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever, and there is enough possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "substitutional war" is facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber became a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their own products, some companies have started a unique system called "YouTuber Adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
Direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative of Staff First, a subsidiary adopted by YouTuber, talked about it.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
In the career rankings that elementary school students want to get in the future, the number of young people who are aiming for will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, we want to adopt and support young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber is not able to earn what they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who don't allow their families to recognize YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide the creators with an environment for salary and content production.
At first, we would like to support our activities by supporting the demerit of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" - Yahoo!
U.S. Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Napper said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return its decision on the military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 in response to an independent interview by the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention reconsidering GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information and other information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that without GSOMIA, the crisis cannot be effectively addressed.
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
"It is essential that the United States and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, collaborate in alliances," he said.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging the national interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300), winning the championship.
He has a strong physical personality and does not suffer from battle.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
It was an impression that Zhou Tensei lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the playing field increased so that he could continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thai young Ace Cantafone and Indian Cy Planis B.
And the three players of Unders Antonsen, who are fighting alone as Europeans.
Although Cantafon did not enter the final at the top of the competition, he was able to advance to the top of the competition by entering the top four in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players can be said to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. has also taken a step out of India, where she has a great selection of singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who are late due to injury, will continue to catch up.
New rates for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was announced in October following the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it almost stopped.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide said last summer, "There is room to lower about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligarchy of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts on terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half.
However, both companies can use SIM locks for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes the terminal number one-third of the total number of subscribers.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was because the construction of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
It was expected that it would be an explosive for the price reduction competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
It may have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and rates of full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision of the fee was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think that it will be good."
However, I don't think the government price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they are announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by themselves.

In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers, including Mt. Toryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] Outbreak & Struggle Overseas ripples "follow and cowardly play" in the "face risk tackle" of American players - Yahoo!
FL Quill in the United States is a rough play and former England representative, "It's not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was the last tournament in 20 countries, and the United States lost 7-45 in England.
It became a black star, but in the second half, the rough play played by Fl. Kyle called a ripple.
He leaves the room with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by foreign media and video, and former English players were bitterly accused of being "an insult and cowardly play."
[Video] "A insult and a cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
the real moment of the face danger tackle played by the u.s. representative kyle
A hot fight crossed the line.
It's 29 minutes in the second half.
The English captain Farrell, who was deeply in the enemy's position, had a balance when he caught his side's path.
It was Kyle who went to Tuckle.
However, he raised his upper body not from the waist, but from the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other's head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
A fierce protest was made by English players to push Quill to play clearly lacking legitimacy.
Both players gathered together at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
After a pitch with a bad face, some of the audience asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" of New Zealand, a strong rugby union player, is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farel, and he dropped out."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Moña, a former English player.
"It's an insult, not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the loss.
However, Kyle's play left a bad taste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced on September 26, the first of 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan that 424 hospitals were deemed to have poor medical records.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare verified the treatment performance of 14 public and public hospitals, and the four facilities of the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, Awara Hospital, Game Sakai City Three Kingdoms Hospital, and the Oda Hospital in Echizen-cho were targeted.
four hospitals that are subject to reorganization
In order to reduce medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to encourage reorganization and integration of hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, we request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no forced force, the local chiefs and residents are expected to repulse due to anxiety that hospitals close to them will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29-1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was high in order of Niigata (53,7%), Hokkaido (48,6%), Miyagi (47,5%), Yamaguchi (46,7%), and Okayama (43,3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals that can respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
They analysed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals are located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased in 25 years, when all of the baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 1191,000 in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds for "altitude acute" and "acute" which require medical care, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services for elderly people.
In order to respond to aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical plan" that specifies the number of beds required for 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to contribute to the revitalization of the discussion by announcing the name of a hospital with poor results.

In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York City, Vancouver has held many events to think about global warming from the last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school on this day complained to the adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I rest the important thing of the school," and many adults who took part in the work rest responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
Department of Agriculture (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
On September 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Tonn cholera" in livestock transmission.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been temporarily suspended.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The prefecture will create a "vaccinated vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation very once again.
Moves such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulation are limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed goods, it is not targeted based on the cost of restrictions on distribution and the impact on farmers, and it effectively tolerates distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
They are also responsible for preventing harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Headquarters.
In the future, public comments and inquiries to prefectures will be conducted until October 7, and new guidelines will be implemented.
It's an open approach to Man U!
"We don't need money" - Yahoo!
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A. League, and now his former Japan national team, Mr. Keisuke MF Honda, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27 July, made a public approach to one club: "We don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the crisis of the wounded, five unincorporated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshar, is forced to slip into the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and is facing challenges in the quality of the front line.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Not strictly a striker, Honda's contract as a creative side player can fill the holes in Andreas Perilla."
Although 9 goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," it has been pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention from his entertainment management of Cambodian representatives."
Is the Honda approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move because of the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Complete installation of 500 portable translators Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
"PokeTalk" is a portable translation machine that is loaned free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on July 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 units in stores and other locations in Hamamatsu City.
It is the first time in Japan that the translation machine will be deployed in the same area, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" started to show the rental destination, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" was shown on the smartphone.
It is accessible from sites in the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city with the declaration of Hamamatsu, the largest inbound support city in Japan.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of acquiring hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representatives of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want to connect with the development of new foreign customers while the business environment is severe."
now, don't you need to tie up your first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not necessarily tiring.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second ball on the ground.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of scattering balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year of professional life, he was 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02 yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodora."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball to the top of the grass in the Ti Area, and you can easily swing 1W.
In the case of Big Carey, it is often used to tie up, but both sides are used to make use of direct drag in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degrees UT.
I am happy to hear the words of admiration that leak from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club horizontally."
"Even with a down blow, I can't fly straight, even if I hit the upper, I'm going right with a cut track.I originally did a direct drag to correct the swing of a 1W shot (at the time of ticking).
The ball is not caught, it is accompanied by a risk of slices, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that you can't imagine.

"Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
The Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toonbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?
Political commentators stated on American television that Greta was " mentally ill, being used by parents and international leftists," and that the television station he used apologized.
In Japan, there are many reports on Greta's comments, such as "It's used and cute" and "It's better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter, "Why do people use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with the lies and conspiracy theories that i can think about.
Mr. Greta, "You see, it started again, and as you realize, those who hate me are still active, as I look, my clothes, my attitude, and I follow different places, they come to think of as far as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but that they seem to be distracting from the issue.
I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
That time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
They don't like it, they don't like it.

I was able to reach the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half.

Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the tip-in-eagle came on No. 6.
It was a chance that Bardi was caught in No. 7, but it was regrettable that he did not reach it in the second half.

The second half of the race will continue, but if you do not win one or more, you should not aim for the winning king, so I would like to win another.
What is the method to prevent dementia and keep things forgotten?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it seems that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I heard about Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: There is a difference between mildness and severeness, and everyone can become dementia when they age.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug Donepegil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and there is no expectation for a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and the number of cancer deaths has decreased due to the remarkable advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible for individuals and families to solve this problem, but it is necessary to create an environment where society can live with peace of mind as a whole.
how to keep things down.
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable that you become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them at the level of forgetting things.
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be easier for people.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence and absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, poverty is becoming obese, and speaking of doing things, you can barely see TVs, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
