Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving young people taking pedals frequently - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
The number of reports on accidents caused by mishandling such as pedal mistakes is increasing, but it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, the number of accidents involving pedals by age is 1080, more often than 24 years old.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you take your feet?
are you safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to mislead other things such as music and conversation, or to make mistakes due to clothes.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals and mulles.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people do not think that it can lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without fear.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, Article 70 of the Safety Operating Obligations Act, which stipulates that "the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.For example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, there is a statement that the driver shall not drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents driving operations, or by wearing shoes that may hinder operation.
It is similar to the intention of each prefecture to consider driving as a violation of "a footwear that can prevent operation" even if it is not specified as a high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, the foot is fixed first on the floor and the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal.When stepping on the accelerator pedal, the foot is tilted to the right as a branch point.
At this time, it is important to keep the kakato firmly fixed so that it does not break regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high-heel, the area where the kato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller, making it difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull a high heel, and sometimes when it comes to sudden braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be stepped, or the heel is removed in the time signature that the heel is pulled, and the heel is stuck inside the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

In the local industry of Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki ceramics manufactured by "Awaji tiles" filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of approximately 20 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo! News
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of consumers' roofing away due to repeated earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Code: 530173983, capital of 92.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for bankruptcy in the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant is Mr. Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishi Tenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), Mr. Daichi Yoshida, and telephone number 06-665-6038.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
Initially, the company started its business as a Ibushi tile manufacturer, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present-day Minami-Awaji City, Minami-Awaji City).
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged with Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Industry Co., Ltd., but at the same time, the head office was relocated to its present location after the change to the current business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was based on Ibushi tiles, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western tiles such as flat plate tiles were produced at 70%, and Ibushi tiles were produced at 30% of the Japanese tiles.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand was sluggish due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, there was a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and it was forced to make severe financing.
For this reason, the Bank sought to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of loans, but there was no sign of a recovery in business conditions, and gradually the financial position was imminent.
I couldn't help but abandoned the business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 20 billion yen.

[From St. Louis 27 (Japan time) ]
The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished and Darbish pitcher (33) of Cubs, who finished the playoffs this season, told the story about the current state of mind: "I haven't done anything for two days, but it's hard to see baseball (from the bench) without any purpose."
This season, he started 31 games, 6 wins and 8 losses, 3 and 98 losses, but he threw 2/3 of 178 times and took 229.
Especially in the second half of the game, the throwing form stabilized, and he continued to play the opponent with outstanding braking force and overwhelming ball force.
"I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be such a feeling.In spring, I thought, "I'm going to end this too," but after coming back from there, I feel I can't believe that I could go to a better place."
From early June, I was able to gradually respond.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased and we can do it every day."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses he had set himself up one after another, his condition became much higher and his grades became better.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it now, I'll talk to agents and families," but "Basically, I don't have any dissatisfaction with this team, and it's fun."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

1 year from the Eastern Iburi Earthquake: Water is secured even during power outage.
In response to the total blackout (blackout) caused by the Eastern Iburi Earthquake in September last year, measures have been taken in the condominiums in Hakodate City where the water has been cut off.
According to the city's Bureau of Water and sewers, seven condominiums were installed in one year after the earthquake, and a "watering plug" was installed that could produce water even after a power outage.
There are over 400 condominiums and private housing units in the city that supply water with a "passenger tank" that could be cut off during a power outage.
The water supply system for houses is broadly divided into two types: the "passenger tank type" for water to be placed in the receiving water tank located underground or on the roof, and the "direct connection type" for water directly from the city's water distribution pipe to each door.
Even if the water pipes are not damaged, electric pumps that pump water from the water tank to each door will not be able to run due to power failure, and each door will not be able to water.

is beauty and ugly a piece of paper?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between the mysterious beauty and the shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "feel."
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of the "Bijo Collection," there was a sentence that "fear, ugly, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out because of the beauty of the women in the opposite direction."
There is a keyword "snake" in many of the works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, but others don't like it.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
Also, since ancient times, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature.
There are "Nabi Girls" and "Nara no Girls" in the 1965 series "Mama Hanakowai!."
The market is mainly for beautiful women with shadows.
In other words, can I say that it is a "cool beauty" type ... that seems to be the commonality of beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Shukan Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work.

There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "We needed a place where people and people could interact with each other.
It is also called "the place of multi-generational exchange" where elderly people participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also leads to support child rearing and the health of the elderly.
It cuts the chain of poverty and promotes the region.
The important thing is, "Don't make children from there."
There are various places to offer meals every day from the beginning of the month.
There are a wide variety of venues, from several to hundreds, from private homes to temples.

However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.

Even though it is a yōgo, " values change by interacting with many people" Yuasa says, "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters."
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

a drone attack on the Saudi oil facility.
"Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has dramatically improved its performance in recent years by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that have crashed.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, with a range of about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars because they fly low."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization of Yemen "Fusi" issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, under the circumstances where its own country cannot export crude oil, can't allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make a profit from crude oil.If we continue to embargo oil against Iran, it is our aim to inform the international community of pain in response to that."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock is coming again.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over, since Trump has publicly stated the withdrawal of US forces from the Middle East," said Mr. Sugawara, "I know that Iran will continue drone bombing in hiding the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever.
The U.S. and Iran's "substitutional war" are facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber became a full-time employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, some companies have started a rare system called "YouTuber Adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary adopted by YouTuber, talked about it.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now the profession of YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the career rankings that elementary school students want to get in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, we adopt young people who are chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber and try to support them.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTubers don't get what they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who don't allow their families to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide the creators who have adopted the environment for salary and content production.
We hope to support our activities by supporting the demerit of the profession of YouTuber, which at first becomes unstable.

"We hope Korea will return to GSOMIA." - Yahoo! News
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Deputy Secretary of State for South Korea, said on 27 November, in response to an independent interview with the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, the Japan-Korea Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on 23 November, "I hope Korea will reconsider and return its decision to its destruction."
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, Korea, the United States, and the ROK to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper claims that without GSOMIA, the crisis cannot be effectively addressed.
"There is time to expire," he urged South Korea to return.
The United States and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, is essential to cooperate in alliances.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging national interests in the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

The sales of daily consumables increased by 1-6 times compared to the same month last year.

According to Apple, the new OS macOS Catalina will be released in October.
The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4?
[Look at all images] The release date of macOS Catalina may be October 4th.
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now revised).
The image certainly has a character from October 4 (fra den 4. oktober).
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, I personally want to try the best feature on macOS Catalina, Sidecar.
This is a feature that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and it was previously realized with a third-party app.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected that it is better with more completeness (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I would like to fully experience the next generation of macOS.

The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Badminton in August, finished the training camp in early September, and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17 August.
Here, we will look back on the first half of the next year's Tokyo Olympics, starting from May to August, and look forward to the men's singles for the mid-September to December.
At the end of the World Championships, Budminton's Olympic Games began in May, and at the end of the World Championships, he competed in four Super 500 and above.
In the first half of the competition, the two players were Kento Momota, who won two of the four competitions, and Shu Tensei of Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championships and Shutensei Indonesia OP (S1000) as well as the World Ranking Point which directly connects to the Olympic Games.
Momota also has Japan OP (S750).
The four competitions that have been held since May include the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/2013), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Fewer than the other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on them.
In August, only the World Championships were held, so fatigue would not be greater than the wartime.
There is a need for good results in the middle of a series of high-level competitions since September.
Taiwan's ACE is a strong match.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Shutensei, who also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), already competed in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical personality and does not suffer from battle.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by gaining high points in the first half.
It was an impression that Shutensei lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the play field increased so that he could continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be a more difficult opponent than ever.
Other than these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Pranis B.
Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone as a European.
Although Cantaphon did not advance to the finals at the top of the competition, he was able to advance to the top of the competition, such as entering the fourth place in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. has also taken a step out of India, where she has a great selection of singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will also catch up in the future.
New rates for mobile phones Price reduction with fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company following the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Act was announced in October.
However, it almost stopped.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide SUGAWA said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and although expectations for price reduction were high, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligarchy of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminals, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half.
However, both companies have a SIM lock that cannot be used for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes the terminal number up to one-third for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was because the development of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
I was expected to be an explosive in the competition to lower the price, so I was wearing a shoulder strap.
It may have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been clarified.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision of the fee was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new fees for the three companies: "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's going to be okay."
However, I don't think the government price reduction will distort the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half the amount while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings of users themselves.
A cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, the Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and the Kikita Shinkin Bank) announced on July 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage from special scams.
In the past three years, depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs (automatic cash depositors) will have an upper limit of 500,000 yen, which can be deposited on a cash card on a day.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank were lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen from ATMs by financial institutions and police officials, etc., and those involved in the credit bank say, "I want to protect your important deposits in the best possible way."

In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers, including Mt. Toryo Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] One-off Departure & Struggle Overseas ripples in the U.S. player's face danger tackle - Yahoo! News
FL Quill in the United States is a rough play and former England representative, "It's not a tackle."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was the last tournament in 20 countries to be played in the United States.
It became a black star, but in the second half, a rough play played by Fljong Quill called a ripple.
In the form of adding shoulder tackles to the face of the opponent, one exit.
The actual scene was released by foreign media and video, and former English players were bitterly accused of being "an insulting and cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "A insult and a cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by the US representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
It was 29 minutes later when I arrived at 0-38.
In a deep battle, the English general Farrell was somewhat balanced when catching his side's path.
It was Kyle who went to Tuckle.
However, he took up the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and hit the upper body intensely.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other's head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
An Englishman protested against a play that apparently lacked legitimacy.
Both players gathered together at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby player, is featured in the headlines: Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play and England wins.
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and he dropped out."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S., with only one game, managed to escape the loss of the game in the 81st minute.
However, Kyle's play left a bad taste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced on September 26, the first of 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, 424.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare verified the treatment performance of 14 public and public hospitals.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "the standards are strange."
In order to reduce medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to encourage the reorganization and integration of hospitals in competing regions.
In October, he requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and plans to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no forced force, it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that the hospital will not be nearby.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29-1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was high in Niigata (53,7%), Hokkaido (48,6%), Miyagi (47,5%), Yamaguchi (46,7%), and Okayama (43,3%).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals that can respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
They analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital is expected to be closed and some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals in Japan to 11.91,000.
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute" and "acute" periods in which nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are taken, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require the elderly.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 parts of the country, with local governments and medical officials discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by announcing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komake eruption, road etc.
A comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held on September 27 in the forest, Nanae and Kabe-cho in the Toshima Kan.
Approximately 400 people from 20 institutions, including roads and three towns, participated.

Climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall to the Canby Bridge and downtown library.

Department of Agriculture (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
On September 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Tonn cholera" in livestock infections.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture, Aichi Prefecture, which has been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been temporarily suspended.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up the "Recommended Area for Vaccination" based on expert opinion on areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The prefectural government creates a "vaccinated vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, are recommended for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will determine the situation very carefully.
Moves such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulation are restricted in principle to the region.
In terms of meat and processed products, it is not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it effectively tolerates distribution outside the country.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of the inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7, and new guidelines will be implemented.
Unaffiliated Honda Keisuke, a public approach to Man U!
"Don't Need Money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 distribution
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and now his former national team, Japan MF Honda Keisuke, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27 July, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could grab in the midst of the ongoing crisis of injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including the MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshar, is forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faces challenges in the quality of the front line.
It was Honda that the Australian media named him a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Not strictly a striker, Honda's contract as a creative side player can fill the hole in Andreas Perilla."
Although 9 goals scored in 18 games in Melbourne Victory are "hard records," it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention from his entertainment management of the Cambodian representative."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move because of the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 units in stores and other locations in Hamamatsu City.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a concentrated manner in the same area, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" started to show rentals, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" was shown on the smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourist Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city under the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu."
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments for two years.
The representatives of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We want foreign customers to develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
now, don't you need to tie up your first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not always tiring.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique when you want to earn a distance by hitting the ball on the ground.
Recent 1Ws involve the risk of ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in the professional seventh year, he is 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02 yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
"I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W) in the spring, so I thought I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball over the grass in the Ti area, and sometimes swing 1W.
In the case of Big Carey, it is often used to tie up, but both sides are used to make use of Naodra in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eyes are broken down."
Carrie recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in a ballistic instrument.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
The battle method that surprises the tour companions also makes me happy to hear the screams from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club horizontally."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I was originally doing a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of ticking).
If the ball is not caught, it is accompanied by a risk of slices, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that you can't imagine.

"Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?"
The Swedish environmental activist Greta Tonberg gave a speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Toombelli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?
Political commentators said that Greta was " mentally ill and used by parents and international left-wings" on American television shows, and the television station he used apologized.
In Japan, there are many reports on Greta's comments, such as "It's good to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter, "Why do adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with as much lies and conspiracy theories as i can think.
"As you notice, people who hate me are still active: my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and I follow different places, they come up with endless lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seem to be distracting from the issue of the story.
I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I wonder if they feel threatened with us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if people like the change, they don't like it.
i'll meet you on the street on friday!

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the height of the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half.
did you see the sixth eagle, seventh bardy?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a Per 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the Chip In Eagle came on No. 6.
Even on No. 7 I was able to catch up with Bardi, but I was disappointed that I couldn't reach it later.
did you get it?
I was glad that the fairway was able to keep the key even in a narrow course because it was not good recently (shot).
It was a course where the distance between the rough and the back of the face was changed, so I didn't have much experience.
what is it?
(Smartphones, etc.) It was possible to shoot a camera.
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for gallery people.
Other than that, there were not many things that changed, but since there were only few Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the desire to "do not lose to overseas players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you don't win one or more, you don't want to aim for the winning king.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of forgetting?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it seems that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Professor Toshisuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference between mildness and severeness, and it is possible for anyone to become dementia after age.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug Donepegil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and there is no expectation for a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and the number of cancer deaths has decreased due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
It is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible for individuals and families to solve this problem, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting.
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable that you become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of "I forgot something."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be easier for people.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is perceived as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can barely see TV, and your body becomes impaired.
Similar situations can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and who do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books everyday and think about things.
