Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving young people taking pedals frequently - Yahoo!
violation of road traffic law
The number of reports on accidents caused by mishandling such as pedal mistakes is increasing, but it is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, the number of accidents involving pedals by age is 1080 more than 24 years old.
It is important for young people to call attention the same way.
do you want to take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to a decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, in the younger generation, it is possible to take steps due to accidental mistakes due to music and conversation etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, mulles, and others drive as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people do not think that it can lead to danger at all, and many people drive without fear.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure that the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations are operated. Article 70 of the Act stipulates that "the operation should not be operated to cause accidents and harm to people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.
It is similar to the intention of each prefecture to consider driving as a violation of "a footwear that can prevent operation" even if it is not specified as a high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of safely pedaling.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, the foot is fixed first on the floor, the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the foot is tilted to the right as a starting point.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not break regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the area where the kato is grounded on the floor is small, and the kato is always blazed, and because the height of the heels is angled throughout the legs, the area of the foot where the pedal is ground is also smaller, making it difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to catch a high heel, and when it comes to a sudden brake, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be trampled, or the heel is removed in the time signature that the heel is pulled, and the heel cannot be stepped inside the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back side of the pedal when stepping back from the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

The local industry of Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics, manufactured by "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self-insolvency debt of about 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!News
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to repeated earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporation Code: 530173983, 99.2 million yen in capital, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for a quasi-self-insolvency to the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishi-Tenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), and one other attorney.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinki Kiln Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged with Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Industry Co., Ltd., but at the same time, the head office was relocated to its present location after the change to the current business name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was based on Ibushi tiles, but due to changes in consumer demand, Western tiles such as flat plate tiles were produced at a rate of 70 percent and Ibushi tiles were produced at 30%.
The company has established a wide range of sales bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, roof construction companies, and other companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock and the frequent damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand for tiled roofs was sluggish, and sales for the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to approximately 1345 million yen.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the company suffered a continuous deficit due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment, and was forced to make a severe financial position.
For this reason, the Bank tried to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of borrowings, but there was no sign of a recovery in business conditions, and funding gradually became tight.
I couldn't help but abandoned the business continuity and this action was taken.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

Especially in the second half of the game, the throwing form stabilized and continued to play the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming ball force.
"I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be such a feeling.In spring, I thought, "I'm going to finish this too," but when I came back from there I felt that I could not believe myself that I could go to a better place."
From early June, I was able to gradually respond.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased and we can do every day."
There was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that he had set himself up one after another, his condition became much higher and his grades became better.
He also became confident that he "had been thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year."
Dalvish, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I have to think about it now, I'll talk to the agent and my family."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

Ito also laughs, "There was just a drinking party that didn't remorse at all," and said, "It was a plus for the scene to make such a time.The team work got better, the motivation got better, and after the end I continued regularly and there are lots of good memories."
The story of the drinking party revealed the unexpected face of Nishijima.
Saijima confesses, "When I have a review meeting with this member, I drink too much, and I often do not remember about half."
Nishida cut out, "I don't know how you're getting hurt," and he said, "It looks like a shirafu, but it's drunk, isn't it really a good hangover?"
As a work that nurtured good teamwork, Nishida expressed his desire to become a series if it is a good reputation, "I would like to borrow your power and work hard to make a series," and Ito and Nakao were disappointed because Nishida was singing "I want to sing this time after watching the movie."

is beauty and ugliness a piece of paper?
The image of "snake" that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work (Magmics) - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I look at it in my hand, I once again notice the correlation between beauty and fear in my work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "feeling, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when there is the beauty of the women in the opposite direction."However, because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of the grudge that dwells in the grudge ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many of the works that appear in Baizu Kazuo, but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as those who see them as "a creepy creature" or those who feel "beautiful."
Some people say they like reptiles in the world, and some say they don't like it.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugliery" may be the same creatures as the front and back.
Also, since ancient times, this creature has been worshipped as a living creature with high spiritual power.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mamagawarai!."
In most cases, a beautiful woman with a shadow is the market price.
If you put it in an imaginative way, can you say it is a "cool beauty" type ... I feel like it is in common with the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work, but in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, deep sleep every 100 years, and mysterious parts are reminiscent of snakes somewhere.

why is it now?
Makoto Yuasa, chairman and social activist of the Kyoto NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
And he said, "There was a need for an exchange base in the area where people interact.
It is also called "the place of multi-generational exchange" where elderly people participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but it also helps raise children and improves the health of the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is, "Don't make children from there."
There are various places to offer meals every day from the 1st of June.
There are a wide variety of venues, from several to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
There is an atmosphere where people who want to do something can be done.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
sometimes we hear issues like a secure management system
Even though it is yōgo, " values change by interacting with many people" "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

A total of eight new Air Force 1 models, including NBA collaboration and Goretecs models, appeared (WWD JAPAN.com)
Nike will launch eight new models of Air Force 1 (AIR FORCE 1) that have gained popularity as a brand-leading sneaker since its launch in 1982.
Three of the eight models are for women's use, and as Nike Women's Footwear Senior Creative Director Georgena James says, "Women are diverse and seek something different from others," an update has been made based on the experience of the collection "The One Reimagined" (released in 2018) that redesigns sneakers from a female perspective.
[Image] Eight new Air Force 1 models, including NBA collaborations and Goretecs models, appeared one after another.
The Air Force 1 NBA Pack, which collaborated with the NBA, appeared in two types: low-cut and high-cut.
The low-cut is based on the NBA's red, yellow, black and navy colors, and the high-cut is available in three teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers.
The NBA logo is attached to Heel and Schutan, and satin fabric is used in the back of the upper.
The price is 132 yen including tax, and it is released on October 1.
The "Air Force 1 Swish Pack" is designed everywhere with swish characters and logos.
It is noteworthy that the part of the shoe tongue, which was originally supposed to have a brand logo, has been changed to a special "SWOOSH" character.
"Air Force 1 Shadow" is characterized by the double shadow of each ditille, including the side wash, inspired by shadows.

a drone attack on a Saudi oil facility.
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Aba Beer" used in the bombing has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that have crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost, and has a range of about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to catch radars because it flies low." (Toru Yokota, a journalist)
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" announced a statement of the crime.
"Iran cannot allow hostile Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under circumstances where its own country cannot export crude oil, and if it continues to embargo crude oil against Iran, it is aimed at informing the international community of pain in response to that."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices surged by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly stated the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, no military intervention will be avoided until at least next year's elections are over, and Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever, and there is sufficient possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "substantial war" are facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber became a full-time employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, some companies have started a rare system called "YouTuber Adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
DmMiX is a direct marketing mix (hereinafter referred to as DmMiX), which is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary that was actually adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is the mechanism behind YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (Kobayashi): Now, YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
We are also in the top ranking of career rankings where elementary school students want to work in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "Youtuber adoption" to support young people who are chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber.
There is an image that YouTuber is an individual voluntarily posting videos, but why did you decide to adopt them?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, there is a reality that most YouTuber can't earn as much money as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and those who don't allow their families to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for employees to create salaries and content.
We hope to support our activities by supporting the disadvantage of the profession of YouTuber, which at first becomes unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" - Yahoo! News
U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Napper, in response to an independent interview with the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 23, the Japan-Korea Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires, "I hope Korea will reconsider its decision to destroy it and return."
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, Korea, Japan, the United States, and Korea, and the sharing of missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis."
"There is time to expire," he urged South Korea to return.
The United States and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, is essential to cooperate in alliance relations.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "damaging national interests in the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

The specific date is not revealed, but may be delivered on October 4th?
[Look at all images] The release date of macOS Catalina may be October 4th.
The image above was posted on the Danish Apple site (now revised).
The image certainly has the character "fra den 4. oktober" from October 4th.

And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected that it is better with more completeness (and response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I would like to fully experience this next generation of macOS.

[The first half of the bad Olympic race] world champion Kento Momoda, and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's Singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland Basel) in badminton's Big Event in August, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17 August.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo starting from May to August, we will look forward to the men's singles in the middle of the Games (September to December).
At the end of the World Championships, Budminton's Olympic Games began in May, and at the end of the World Championships, he competed in four Super 500 and above.
In the first half of the competition, the two players were Kento Momoda, who won two of the four races, and Shu Tensei (Cho Tienchen).
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei Indonesia OP (S1000) as well as the World Ranking Point which is directly connected to the Olympic Games.
In addition to that, Momota also controls JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held from May to May in the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/2013), Japan OP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of top players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the part.
In August, only one World Championships was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the wartime period.
There is a need for good results in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
He was a strong Taiwanese ace in the series.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the top Indonesian OP and Thai OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
As the tournament continues, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by gaining high points in the first half.
It was an impression that Shutensei lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability in the field of play increased so that he could continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's number one, it seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thailand's young Ace Cantaphon and India's Cy Planis B.
Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone as a European.
Although Cantafon did not advance to the finals at the top of the competition, he had the power to advance to the top, such as entering the fourth place in the second season.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against the top players seems to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. has also taken a step back in India, where she has a great selection of singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who are late due to injury, will also be catching up in the future.
New rates for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as part of the revised Telecommunications Business Act of October.
However, it almost stopped high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligarchy of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to become an easy-to-use pricing system by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The Act prohibits set discounts on terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the terminal a maximum of half.
However, both companies have a SIM lock that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes up to one third of the terminal generation for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was because the development of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
It was expected to be an explosive for the price reduction competition, so it was dressed in a shoulder strap.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and prices of full-scale services have not been clarified.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision of the price was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's going to be good."
However, it does not seem that the government price reduction will ease the market and encourage sound competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the consumer's burden exceeds half while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half."
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings of users themselves.
Lowering the withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen Cash Card for 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, the Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on July 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 or older who have not made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn by cash card is 500,000 yen.
On October 1, the Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank lowered the Kihoku Shinkin Bank from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions and police officials, etc., and those in the Shinkin Bank "I want to protect customers' precious deposits in the best possible way."
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU who was transferred to Mutsu room including Yokozuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun
Following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki Reverse Hoko), the Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27, that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers in the Itsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAGI and one sumo wrestler to Mutsu room.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Ozeki Kirishima), was from the Izutsu room and was a brother and son of the late Izutsu Chikakata.
The parents of Itsutsu died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same room of Kagamiyama, and the treatment was discussed in the future.
There are 12 sumo wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Toryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu, at the time of autumn.
[ Rugby World Cup] One-shot dropout and fight against the U.S. player's "face risk tackle" overseas ripple "a insult and a cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
FL Quill in the United States is a rough play and former England representative, "It's not a tackle."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was the last tournament in 20 countries to be played in the United States.
It was a black star launch, but in the second half, a rough play played by FL John Quill called a ripple.
In the form of adding shoulder tackles to the face of the opponent, one exit.
The actual scene was released by foreign media and video, and former English players were bitterly accused of being "a insult and a cowardly play" and "not a tackle."
[Video] "Follow and cowardly play" and overseas ripples!
The actual moment of face danger tackle played by U.S. representative Quill
A hot fight crossed the line.
It was 29 minutes later when I arrived at 0-38.
In a deep battle, the English general Farrell was somewhat balanced when catching his side's path.
It was Kyle who went to Tuckle.
However, he raised his upper body not from the waist down but from the upper body violently.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other's head, and they are in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
An Englishman protested against the play, apparently lacking legitimacy, as he attempted to penetrate Quill.
Both players gathered together at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby player, is featured in the headline "The Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and he dropped out."
The article introduces the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S., which lacked a single match, managed to escape the loss in the 81st minute by a decisive try.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste behind.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced on September 26, the first 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan that judged that there was a lack of medical experience.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the medical record of 14 public and public hospitals, and the four facilities were targeted: the National Hospital Organization of the city, Awara Hospital, Game Sakai City Three Kingdoms Hospital, and the Oda Hospital in Echizen Town, and the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital in the town of Game Takahama.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "Strong standards."
In order to reduce medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to encourage the reorganization and integration of hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, we request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion, it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that hospitals nearby will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
The hospital was targeted at 29-1 percent of the total, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53,7%), Hokkaido (48,6%), Miyagi (47,5%), Yamaguchi (46,7%), and Okayama (43,3%) were high.
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals that can respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
They analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals to 11.91,000 in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute" and "acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are taken, while there is a shortage of rehabilitation for elderly people with high needs.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture developed a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, municipalities and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt.Komake eruption, road, etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan.
Approximately 400 people including 20 officials and residents attended the event.
It was the first meeting since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It was the first time in 18 years that residents participated in extensive training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in forests and Nanae-cho, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.

Department of Agriculture (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo!
On July 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released a draft amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Tonn cholera" in livestock transmission diseases, which would enable preventive vaccination against farmed pigs that are not currently recognized.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs that are vaccinated is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterrestrial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been temporarily suspended.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "Recommended Area for Vaccination" based on the opinions of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The prefecture in question creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation and decide again.
Moves such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulation are limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, it is not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it virtually accepts distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He is also involved in the prevention of harmful rumors.
The amendments to the Guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defectious Disease Control Headquarters.
In the future, an opinion inquiry and public comment to the prefecture will be carried out until October 7 and a new quarantine guidelines will be implemented.
A public approach to the unaffiliated Honda Keisuke and Man U!
"I don't need money" - Yahoo!News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 distribution
Last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and now his former Japan national team, Keisuke Honda, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th, Japan time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, the world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on October 24.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was also named.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including the MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshar, is forced to slip into the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and is facing challenges in the quality of the front line.
It was Honda that the Australian media named him a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Not strictly a striker, Honda's contract as a creative side player can fill the hole in Andreas Perilla."
Although 9 goals scored in 18 games at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," it has been pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention from his entertainment managing the Cambodian representative."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward for the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machine "PokeTalk" at its membership office and other stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a concentrated manner in the same area, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loans included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" started to show rentals, and the location of "stores for foreign languages" was shown on the smartphone.
It is accessible from the site of Lake Hamana Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city under the declaration of "Japan's largest inbound support city Hamamatsu."
The Chamber purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I would like to connect with the development of new foreign customers while the business environment is severe."
now, you don't need to tie the first hit, right?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not always tiring.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique to hold a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance with a second hit of par 5.
Recent 1Ws involve the risk of ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in the professional seventh year, he is 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In spring, he opened his eyes saying, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodora."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball over the grass in the Tire area and easily swing 1W.
In the case of Big Carey, it is often used to tie up, but both sides are used to make effective use of Naodra in narrow halls.
"It can be used in halls where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W, and Cady is more secure than 3W..."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17 degrees UT.
I'm also happy to hear the screams from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club horizontally."
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a straight drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of ticking).
If the ball is not caught, it is associated with the risk of slice, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that you can't imagine.

[Tweet Collection] Greta Toombelli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening children?
Political commentators stated on American television that Greta was " mentally ill and used by parents and international leftists" and apologized to the television station.
In Japan, there are many reports on Greta's comments on the Internet, such as "It is used and cute" "It is better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as i can think.
"As you realize, those who hate me are still active; they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different; they come to think of as many lies and conspiracy theories as possible."
They also pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seem to be disproportionate.
I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
At that time could be another good.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if people like the change, they don't like it.

[Video] Come to Japan!
Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable that the patter was not able to stretch well.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a Per 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the Chip In Eagle came in No. 6.
It was a great opportunity for Bardi to catch the 7th, but I regret that I couldn't reach it later.
what did you get here?
Since I haven't been in good condition recently (shots), I was glad that I was able to keep up even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the distance between the rough and the back of each other was changed, so I didn't have much experience so I studied quite well.
what is it?
(Smartphones, etc.) It was possible to shoot a camera.
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for gallery people.
There were not many other things that changed, but since there were only few Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you do not win more than one, you should not aim for the winning king, so I would like to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of "forget"?
Interviewed and written by Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center I talked to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a difference in the degree of dementia.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the death of infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and the death of cancer has decreased due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible for individuals and families to solve this problem, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live safely in the region.
How to keep things to the degree of forgetting.
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and keep them to the degree of "forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easier to become.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence and absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where cooking is not possible can use it.
Then, it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and speaking of doing things, you can barely see TV, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and who do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books everyday and think about things.
