Croatia's nuclear treatment facility plan, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the town of northwestern Bosnia and protested the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from its only nuclear power plant near the river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstration participants gathered in the town of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly requested Croatia to abandon the plan to store the site of the barracks in Turkovska Gola, and pledged to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote "Don't take a healthy future" and "We need a firm stop-gun" said that nuclear waste treatment facilities could threaten the lives of about 250,000 residents in the Una and surrounding areas.
We must oppose it.
The head of the municipality of Novi Grad, Miloslav Dryaka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and rivers.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which began operating in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
The Croatian national broadcasting reported on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided to build its own storage facility or to pay for the cost of the waste of Croatia that Slovenia would be treated at a newly constructed facility.
Mr. Tomislav Chorich, Minister of the Environment and Energy of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia had problems in the disposal of public facilities waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wanted to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket be the perfect place for the Turkovska gola?"

What is the Münchhausen syndrome that appeared in The Polytchan of Netflix?
Symptoms are false that parents and parents are sick.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is the story of Patton Hobart, who aims to be President of the United States, but the first step is to become the student president of his high school.
It was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, and was featured by Gwinnes Paltlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill despite the fact that humans under their protection are not seriously ill.
There are various types of pathology, but there are also munhhausen syndrome, which is hypothesized to be a disease of himself.
However, the representative Munchhausen syndrome is clearly false that others under their protection are ill.
This is also known as FII, counterfeiting or induced disease, and is a type of child abuse.
Although it is unusual, parents usually exaggerated symptoms or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what is the sign of the proxy Munchhausen syndrome?
Although the signs of pathology change in case-by-case, NHS points out the following matters as caution.
Children are likely to be healthy, but if the condition is bad, they try to calm down.
I'll explain to you, or complain about false symptoms.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as mixing grape sugar into the urine sample and showing diabetes.
Excessively administered drugs and other drugs to cause disease symptoms.
How general is Muunchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.

Kaduna - The State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
The police said that children were placed in a humanitarian environment, but the school denied this claim.
"The children are in school with parents' consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
The parents came to deliver a meal to their children every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were doing.
I was very surprised that the police came and evacuated the children, and after the parents left all the food, the school closed.
There are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair treatment."
He added that the former police headquarters, Abdullahman, had visited once to confirm what kind of environment the children were doing, but never complained.
The children also learn Corlan and say that it's all about it.
However, police chief Yakub Savo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of getting knowledge about Corlan, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were injured on their back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage gyrie suit with leaves caught a 12-year-old girl from behind in a school in Central Coast, Missouri.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to trees and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges, including this assault and another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on the road and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and a knife suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, stop, stop."
The man said to the girl, "I'm going to make a loud voice.
If you hear a loud voice, you will not be able to match the painful eye."
The man had a knife on his right hand, and the girl's hands tied in a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused for nearly an hour.
The girl ran into a school screaming and crying like crazy.
The man had several mobile mails and telephones from his workplace colleagues, but he did not respond, and arrived at the workplace at 9:30 AM.
The man stood out in the clothes of mud, grass, trees, etc., and was involved in street violence, claiming that he had been chasing the driver down to the bush, and that he had been around by hand.
The man's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development, based on public interests, warned IT representatives
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, investors, and others that if there was no ethical assessment of public interest on Friday, artificial intelligence development competition and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met.
At the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions on future and dangers in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of war technology and increased machine work, and at the same time, examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and social media companies in response to the brutal video outflow were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines were freed from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, then unfortunately, we're going to go back to a situation that can be considered a sort of barbarian based on the theory of strong people.
According to the organizers of the conference, they would like to take advantage of the expertise of the participants in the conference and find the talent to be a future advisor to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.

Martín Woodegor gave a surprise support to Michel Oyalusabar.
Real Madrid won the Ossuna at 2-0, renewing the undefeated record in the current domestic season, making it the top spot in La Liga.
However, despite the lack of one game in La Liga this season, the director Zinedine Zidane is exposed to tremendous pressure, such as a fierce open battle and a public discontent with the Welsh star Gareth Bayle.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by Paris Saint Germain (PSG) in the Champonnes League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, the director and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniole is one of the stars that took place in the future of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.

Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Arabes, and was surprised by Michel Oyalusaval's pre-emption, and Real Socieda won his home in 3-0.
Martín Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite pass through the inside of the other two players to Oyalusabar, where he decided to take the ball completely accurate.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third penalty spot of the stunning Oyalusabar, Alabeth's midfiller Manu Garcia secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before the end of 5 minutes.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
The Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated this territory.

On Thursday, Anna Hazale asked the executive officer's lawsuits and suspicions that Sharad Powerr was involved in the fraud, saying, "They only know how Sharad's name emerged and who mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Power, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted detailed investigations into the fraud case, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Power denied all fraud and claimed that there was no relationship with the co-bank, and questioned the timing of a lawsuit registration just weeks before the Maharashtra parliamentary election on October 21.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, stating that he would not surrender before Delhi's "Government."
The NCP referred to a lawsuit by the Executive Bureau as a formality.

Stop the accident!
Four preemptive devices that can be rearranged - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driving mistakes.
In particular, an increase in the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator steps by elderly drivers is on the rise.
In particular, when you start suddenly, you will be panicked and the accelerator will continue to follow the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with a safety driver support function that will cover such driving errors, but there are also rearing equipment that can be attached to an unattended car.
After-sale parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapids and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALRM] To inform you of the pedal mistake from a new perspective, "e-ACCEL ALRM" developed by Pivot.
The pedal's step mistake is to avoid using the alarm sound.
The mechanism arises " alarm sound" when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of braking at stop or slow driving.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping, it avoids rapid acceleration.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the stepping error of the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf to hear.
It is attached to the OBDII connector, and the body is attached with two-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is easy to set up.
[Ashimori-kun] The world wing was launched in mid-September, but the accelerator brake step prevention device "Ashi-do-kun."
It is also possible to reverse (back) without advance.
At the time of the stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped in, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the rapid advance.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I did not tell the signal from the accelerator, and immediately controlled the advance by turning it into a creeping state (where the brake is removed in the D range).
There is also a function to detect the speed of about 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The mounting is possible only with a caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Mr. Suosato Kusumoto (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked the nursery school were suddenly unable to go to the nursery school after the flood, and they were forced to leave at night.
"Because adults were busy cleaning up the house and had no time to face enough," he said, "I want adults to prepare for a disaster so that children can say "OK."
Yukari Otsukashi (36) in Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
"If there is a child who can't stay still, I'll use the feeling around it."
The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children from 4 to 12 years old, was soaked in water around the house.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible during the disaster, and I have food and simple toilets.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the need for the family configuration and housing situation will change."
Shinko Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, with six and eight-year-old children, proposed that the elementary school had an e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or email system.
There were also requests for system construction that could be shared in real time on flooded roads.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed since before, and I can't understand that the last time it was okay."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connection with people and prepare for disasters."
The representative of Tanaka said, "The opinions that were issued are thought to convey to the government as a group."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Arcuri is a reference to the police agency.
The Police Agency (IOPC) will examine whether the scandal in London's mayor's office should be investigated as a violation of criminal law.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded "acts concerning acts" of the prime minister on suspicions that Mr. Curi had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"There is information that there is a possibility of a crime," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this issue.
The issue was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC was an agency that responded to charges issued by the police in England and Wales.
The issue was entrusted to the police agency because Johnson was at the time in a position comparable to the police chief.
Johnson denied fraud related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information about his relationship with the Curri.
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but the press reported that the Americans who moved to London seven years ago were paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the London mayor's period, and that Johnson and others were given preferential treatment to join the foreign trade delegation three times.
Since then, the government has frozen 100,000 pounds of subsidies to the hacker house, the company of Mr. Curi during the investigation.
The company will ask questions about the investigation process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Waman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Digital Department has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Curi (34) is now located.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among the staff."
The movement of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police agency touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
The government officials say that this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too party-oriented."
"In any case, the supervisory authority did not submit evidence, and the Prime Minister was not given an opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority prior to the press announcement issued late Friday night."
The public and the media will see the political Kyogen played by the people.
As I mentioned earlier, Standard Newspapers heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division was "public secret."
The former staff of the London and Partners (L&P) stated that although there were people who thought that the company was "untrustful" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany the trade-related talks abroad led by Johnson during the mayoral period.
A safe fund for ordinary living people to use for property formation!
Morning Star - Yahoo! News
I heard the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawagami (photo), President and CEO of Iwakami Tonobu.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
What are you feeling now?
First, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep appreciation to all the people involved, not just the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, "Sawakami Fund" was established with the desire to support the formation of property for general living people.
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursued for 20 years.
If the general public is eliminated from the anxiety of money, the world will be bright from the foundation, and we are working hard every day as a whole.
In the long term, operation will not be performed if you do not walk with beneficiaries.
There are many money in the "Sawakami Fund" when the market plunges like the Lehman shock and the IT bubble burst.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have been talking about since the time of the day.
We believe that this is the reason why it has become a long-term fund for 20 years and that it has continued to be a direct sales system to deliver messages directly to many people.
In the report at the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just conveying the results, the information about what you're buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
the third drug arrester is the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - Last year, Rapper's Mac Miller was arrested and charged with drug offenses associated with the death of drug overdose.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon mixed with phenyl before Miller accidentally took over cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl, but Fentanyl is a powerful opioid drug that is problematic as thousands of deaths occur in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Pett, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Pett was getting drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Libis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, was accused of delivering drugs to Pett as Walter's "deliver."
All three were not directly charged with Miller's death, and there was still an anti-bent about individual cases.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for the 2005 drug case, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violations of his compliance.
On Thursday, the prosecutors in charge of the first issue reported by the celebrity site TMZ called for Walter to be detained until the trial began because of the high possibility of escape from abroad.
There was no immediate response to the phone call to the lawyer.
Pettyt was charged with the federal court on September 4, but the defenders refused to comment.
The lyrics of Miller's lyrics have been characterized by a frank word about depression and drug use, and the hip hop world has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, but was defeated in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grandde posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram, and released a song about the mirror, "Sancue Neckst."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died recently associated with opioid drug abuse.
The rock band Three Doors Down guitarist Matthew Roberts died of overdose of drugs in 2016, and Fentanyl and Hydrocodon were detected in the body.
This article corrected the spelling of Walter's name by Stephen instead of Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
This 9-year-old boy uses a free programming app called Scratch2 to create a game of ghosts.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime, and stories on and off-line.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch the bat that came out of the hiding place.
He learned how to make games in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN that he spends time making games when bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day short-term intensive course for children aged five to fifteen.
The course, organized by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil a chance to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing with many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, he became interested in Basil's game production.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," he said.
He said, "I'm always playing games, but how do I make my own games to play with others?"
When I said, I was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basil, who has been interested in learning how to make his own games, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step in the game production.
Basil-chan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has a name on his own game.
One of the games, "Moskite mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The African youth population is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is made, the young generation such as Basil will take the initiative.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been awarded a robot that uses program code to divide housework.
In May 2019, the women's high school team in Ghana, who programming boxed robots, won the Robot Contest.
Google and Microsoft's huge technology companies are investing in Africa, and Basil-chan and the children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, false testimony of bribery investigation
According to a court document submitted on Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to falsely testify to federal agents who conducted corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the list of federal court lawsuits, Robin Hayes will be convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes, Hayes was aware of false statements by FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the documents based on the facts are not clear which sin is accepted by Hayes.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor charged Hayes' former legislators in charge of the plan of the insurance company's heavy duty to fund the election to the head of state insurance.
Two co-owners, Greg Lindberg, were charged with attempted bribery by Mike Cozy.
Lindberg, founder of insurance and investment companies, has donated more than $500 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported Republican philosophy and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer called for a comment on Friday, but did not respond.
On Friday, Hannes Davis, the defendant of Hayes, requested an additional comment by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes did not speak with Corsey about the State Insurance Bureau staff.
However, according to the fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about the state insurance director and the request of personnel transfer from Lindberg.
The prosecutor said he helped Lindberg's request that Hayes would like to meet with Corsey, and spoke directly with the director.
The prosecution, published in April, claimed that Lindberg would seek special treatment for his insurance business, and would have raised $200 million to campaign for Cozy's 2020 reelection.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy was involved in the request for replacement of the authorities who had reviewed the company in Lindberg.
Republican Corsey reported suspicions of bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no doubts.
The prosecution is described in a conversation, including Lindberg and Cozy, that Lindberg co-owners instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would pay attention if he could move such expensive money, but he eventually broke out in the conversation.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes said, "What do you want?"
i know, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office requested an e-mail for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
It's a good idea to improve the happiness of Facebook and users!
In the first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like other people's posts!
This change followed the start of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, and liked it!
The new Facebook attempt will start on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy director Mia Garrick stated that this change was based on feedback from mental health experts that would cause happiness surveys and goodies!
Garrick said, "There was a very positive feedback from many bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
The user only deletes the numbers so that they can focus on the quality and content of the exchange, rather than the number of reactions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick stated that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
It is very early in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, and other countries where Instagram tests are conducted.
Instagram, under Facebook, does not announce when the test ends or changes.
"There were initially positive feedback about the experience in Instagram, but now it's a step to listen to and learn feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia had a very aggressive Facebook and Instagram user.
He thought Australia would be a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

Self repair of broken bag fittings to Otok ♪ 【Cand】 "Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was a hand-crafted part of Cando that helped me in such a situation.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, her chin is the ultimate pchipra.
Therefore, if you ask for a repair shop, the price of the main body was significantly higher.
My mother unfortunately said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up.
First of all, I visited the Home Center and looked for the replacement of this connected fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, everything is silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Candu, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
As expected, everything will be 100 percent.
Originally it seems to be a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
We purchased two bags each at each end of the bag handle.
Although the size of the ring is small, it is made exactly the same as the bag fittings on one side left.
This opens the way to bag repair.
It is attached tightly.
what is it?
The ring openings are designed to break inside and are resistant to pulling outside.
I attached it to the bag.
The color of the metal fittings is perfect for the gold system ♪ However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor ...
So I tried to make a ring with two formulas.
The number of metal fittings increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight is not quite a problem.
Rather, I feel that the number of cracked parts increased and the design level was improved.
Aso, an express train of the National Railways, travels 10 hours from Hiroshima to Kumamoto | Shizuoka Shimbun at Esss
To wait for the departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train that was inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR period = 28th.
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 people, including train fans, boarded 12 blue carriages from Hiroshima Station, and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destiny Campaign" by JR companies, the tour was organized.
The train consists of seven cars, a carriage and a locomotive.
A special headmark was drawn by Mt. Aso.
his brother's life imprisonment with social media star in Pakistan, the honor murder of kandir balochi.
Candy Baroch, who gained fame in his photos posted on social media, was hanged in July 2016.
His brother, the popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with an honorary murder, which was the most popular of his father's state Pakistan.
In July 2016, Balochi, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, was hanged.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
In a press conference a few days later, his brother told him that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Saldar Memoud, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in a judgment awaited.
He said, "I will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Balochi's mother Anwar Mai told AFP that his son wanted to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son are my mother."
The killing of Mr. Balochi has become a major news all over the world, and as lightening the rules of the father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, are killed, and the so-called " honorary murder" are reburning.
In the case of Mr. Baruche, the woman chose her own marriage partner, she was burned in a crime such as praise of her sexuality and insulting her family, killing, stabbed or killed.
The murder is usually carried out by close relatives.
Later, in Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) law, the perpetrators can be pardoned from the relatives of the victims.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill that required life imprisonment for honorable murder.
However, it is still at the discretion of the judge whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can claim another motive in theory and be pardoned.
In the case of Mr. Balochi, his parents initially insisted that his son be pardoned.
However, his parents were sad about losing his son and asked him to change his mind and forgive his son.
In response to international hate for killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented measures to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
His famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team, and wearing a bright red dress that was widely opened on Valentine's Day.
Although it became critical and threatening, it was recognized by many people, including young people, when the new heavens and earth were opened in a country considered to be a political activity to enhance the status of women boldly and to express themselves as a presence like Kim Kardashian.
The roots of "respectful" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, especially in women's actions, although men may be victims.
To donate a cold sheet and a storage box to the affected areas | Yamagata Shimbun
The cold sheet box was installed at the "Old Juseki Chu Ground" in the first evacuation place in the Gugugaguan district of Tsuruoka City.
Yamagata Shimbun will donate 1600 cold and thermal insulation sheets for aluminum evacuationers and 5 outdoor storage boxes (equivalent to about 1 million yen) to the four autonomous communities in the temperate areas of Tsuruoka City, which were affected by the earthquake in June caused by the earthquake off the coast of Honshu.
In order to prepare for the tsunami, they will be placed in the "1st evacuation place" in each coastal area.
The ceremony will be held on February 2 at the "Old Juseki Chu Ground" in the first evacuation place in the area of Guekkan.
It was damaged by an earthquake in Tsuruoka City, which concluded a partnership agreement, and a cold sheet was donated to the autonomous association of the temperate region closest to the epicenter.
The recipient of the donation is Koiwa-gawa River (500 storage boxes, 2 storage boxes) Shoda (300 storage boxes, 1 storage box) (400 storage boxes, 2 storage boxes) - each autonomy association.
Many residents of the coastal area of the Sea of Japan were alerted to the tsunami and evacuated.
In the city of Tsuruoka, they escaped to the first evacuation site where they were located on high ground in each village.
Although large tsunamis did not occur, most of the refugees returned home without moving to a second-order evacuation site where accommodation facilities and facilities were well equipped, many of the first evacuation sites were asked to appeal cold because they were outdoors.
As a result of similar disaster preparedness, measures to prevent severe cold and wind rain were one of the challenges.
A seat that can cover the whole body during evacuation and cover cold and wind rain.
It also has thermal insulation function in the world of flame.
The seat is about 1.3 meters x 2.1 meters, and when folded, it becomes a pocket size of 9 cm × 12 cm.

In addition to actively cooperating in the activities carried out by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
The two organizations engage in training related to sports, mediating and dispatching individual trainers and instructors, and sharing information.
When a team of remote islands embark on an expedition outside the island, they will work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of the trainer in terms of travel costs.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in cooperation with the prefectural competitions and other local competitions, we will support the team to prevent the performance of the athletes due to fatigue during the voyage and night stay.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, they cooperate with local recoil clinics and hospital officials to support players from outside the island.
On the 25th, there was a signing ceremony at Elabco in China-cho, where both Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.

(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenjiro Shigeki has been thinking twice as much about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the pre-production (see related article), Mote-no-Otoko firmly adheres to the traditional "Man's Fantasy" and the pattern learning for Mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad man and become a cool, mote man.
if you are bound by what you should do, you will live.
In the first part, we talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and people's behavior.
When learning patterns, I think the brain will be able to systematically act like this, so I think it will be possible to live in Lak.
I think I'm still evolving every day, depending on whether it's "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you're stuck with an old pattern that says, "The teacher at university is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "Let's do this" or "what should we do," you will live.
Because people and society change even if they don't change.
I've been talking about that in my recent talk book, "No matter how terrible it is in the world."
"It's heavy" and "authority" are things that come out naturally by admitting people around them.
It's not that easy.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
Isn't you doing this at the Cannes Film Festival?

In other words, you can't be light if you're being bound by "the beauty."

In the northwest of Nigeria, illegal state doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled by about 40,000 due to the intensified violence in the last four months.
According to the UN Refugees Agency, a new humanitarian crisis was created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, each institution cooperated with a new fund raising of $35.5 million.
UNHCR's Barbar Barrok said that the Islamic extremist organization Bokoham, which has been active in anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, violent acts in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina, Nigeria over the last decade were organized by armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok said on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, assault, murder and sexual violence were frequently occurring, and that the raiders were working to destroy and steal homes.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with the West African branch of the Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with the name of the group."
What they carry is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR stated in a statement that the security situation in Sokot, particularly in Sokot, was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the coming months.
the new trial date for men killed two women and children is confirmed.

According to the Polk County Court records, Marvin Escobar Orillana (31) was prosecuted for the first-class murder in three cases, a false name, Marvin Esquibel Lopez, who was named to the police at the time when the authorities recognized it.
He claims not guilty.
According to the police, on July 16, he was shot dead by Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29) and her daughter (11) and son (5).
In court records, a new date of trial will be decided on January 27, and the time will be given to both plaintiffs and defendants for further preparation.
According to the U.S. Immigration Bureau officials, Escobal Olyana was illegally staying in the United States and was forced back twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.

In order to respond to requests from advertisers in recent years, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year by collaborating with media companies to directly purchase advertising frames that accompany advertisers' requests.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that the LFP header binding can be used to bid directly to the header binding target advertising frame, which is expected to improve the delivery opportunities for advertising.
In addition, due to the limited number of medium-sized companies, the advertising framework for the distribution of individual goods and brand images is secured and the brand value is prevented.
The benefit of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each Vidder company called "Lapper Solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, will enable them to work closely with the hope of introducing media companies.
Product support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) | Shizuoka Shimbun at Esss
The Japan External Trade Promotion Agency (Jertro) is working to support the expansion of sales channels for small and medium-sized enterprises through the Internet page overseas.
It is an attempt to set up a special corner of Japan on an overseas site to introduce local products and sell them directly to foreign consumers.
The company's application has exceeded 1,000 companies, and has been successful in China and Southeast Asia.
"JAPAN MALL Project" started last year.
The main target of small and medium-sized enterprises with no overseas sales channels is to boost the global expansion of cosmetics, beverages and processed products.
It is possible to sell at 24 major sites such as Europe, the Middle East, and Asia in cooperation with Getro.
Two months to stop Assistant Professor Yamagata at Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced on the 27th that he had suspended an assistant professor at the U.S. Sawa Campus for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Department of General Affairs, in October 2017, Assistant Professors of the Department of General Affairs gave strong emotional stress when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory.
He was a teacher of education and was certified to have deteriorated the learning environment.
In a survey conducted in September 1818, several students appealed.
In December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and in December of the same year, the faculty of the Yonezawa Campus conducted a survey of harassment prevention measures committees.
In response to the findings from the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
Even after the survey, Assistant Professors continued to teach, but during the interview, the previous act was improved, and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deep gratitude to the victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to take all of my studies to prevent harassment and strive to recover confidence."
The university also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students who are taught by the faculty of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts The Sun Paper demands Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of the EU withdrawal and make compromises with the EU.
Now, only three weeks after the EU summit, which will be a settlement, there is a growing concern around the prime minister that the prime minister might not be able to take a significant concession.
Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion in the Cabinet that seeks to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and bring compromises with the EU.
Negotiations over a new tariff system that replaces the back stop clauses related to the Irish border are packed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "improvable."
The Senior Ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by the German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose a compromise proposal, including a three-year time limit on backstop, to the Conservative Party leader.
The Sun spoke to three ministers, who were ready to confront the Prime Minister after the Conservative Party's annual meeting in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the "extremeal" strategy that threatens the EU, which was devised by the Senior Advisor Dominique Camings, and insists that the EU will accept the offer to come out of limited time.
One cabinet member said that the ruling that the Supreme Court held on Tuesday was illegal was called "the alarm bell," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on 31 October.
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his step.
It is not effective even if it is radical, and the Camances project is clearly failing.
It is impossible to fight in so many areas.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Mr. Johnson to carry out an agreement with Prime Minister Terryza May.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's agreement to the House."
There are so many things that everyone wants to end this.
If there is no delay, Bolis will end and we will end.
Sir John Mayer condemned Boris not seriously thinking about negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party gave a harsh speech: "The Prime Minister wants to connect with the EU.
However, we do not see the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU in order to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the Prime Minister in Scotland fighting with the bulls, inspecting the eggs in the Ulles, and discussing with the people in the streets.
The Prime Minister's press acknowledged yesterday that the agreement is still a long time ahead, and said, "If anyone does not think about it, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which forced the re postponement of the three months, would greatly weaken the position of our negotiations in Brussels.
The press said, "It is certain that this bill hinders the position of our negotiations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue their progress despite the enactment of the bill."
The European Union withdrawal minister Stephen Barclay returns to Brussels today to discuss further with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how the regulation of all Irish islands on food and livestock works.
Lorain Kelly: I was told that the Glasgow accent would never be a success in the television world.
Lorain Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, stated that he was told by the bosses of the television station that he would "not be successful."
Prior to appearing on television for the first time, "It was so nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled the 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I was working as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never be successful in the television industry.
Before he took over the Glasgow office, he went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewed by legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe he was in the same room as a living legend.
I found my place here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast, and Daybreak, and later began a program named after her.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, she will broadcast a special program to reflect Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
He added that passion and enthusiasm and curiosity were the key to survival in the television industry, and that the moderator said, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested in and interested in various people.
Looking back at the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that the interview was "very painful."
The next day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think we were seeing many of the families of the injured children who were killed or broadcast live shows from Dunbulane.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna, told me to personally meet me, so we decided to speak for hours at her house.
Don't take all of it on the show, I went to Joanna funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McKan's daughter Maderrain were missing, saying that it was "very painful" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets that do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 am on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, fear of traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Konstantino Chiwenga denied the offer of President Robert Mugabe, who was in the midst of a political change, due to concerns that it might be a trap to follow the military action in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the Defense Forces continued, and the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give the presidency.
However, Chiwenga's refusal to offer was not due to anxiety, but because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of the regime in a coup.
According to a series of Twitter by Jamwanda2, officials confirmed that it was a high-ranking official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who had been in power for 37 years, is willing to give the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munangagwa," it is said that there was a fierce negotiation about the matter at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, tried to contact Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was carried out by three.
President Spokesman George Charanba, and his high-ranking officials reported that Aaron Nepela, the top representative of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, and Fidelis Mukonoli, the Roman Catholic bishop, were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, former president of the Zimbabwe Preparatory Bank, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat alone to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Chiwenga.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, failed to attempt to condemn the African Union's actions while seeking intervention by African leaders.
The offer to give the presidency to former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of the former president.
"Some of the late President's family began to suffer fatigue, and it was an abandoned act to save the rapidly expanding situation as dangerous as possible," he wrote.
However, at least there was a little political objective of the late president, who wanted to change the flow by diplomatic alone.
If there was anything to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to conflict with the African Union's view of the coup, but I would like to remind you that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and not be defeated.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top of the army at that time, would trap and destroy the claims of the commanders claiming that the constitutional order was not broken.
The late President Mugabe wanted the African Union to decide whether it would be a coup without fully grasping the entire situation and whether it would eventually be considered a valid military intervention request.
It was intended and calculated at the bottom of this offer.
When he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces, Mugabe was moving, and officials said.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe would have to write his resignation.
The commanders of the army told Mugabe that even if they invaded the President's house, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that point, Mugabe wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove the deprivation of power by the military.
The commanders and commanders at that time read the intent accurately.
The words "Is Tiri Bemaqwapa Macwapa" (which we belong to the military department) were used to describe powerful metaphorical expressions that were not politicians but only in political competition."
The army told the local commanders that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the purpose was to remove the "criminals" surrounding him rather than to defeat Mugabe.
In order to discuss coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at that time, the South Africans, who were key to this process, refused to intervene, but clarified that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare, as the military had repeatedly threatened behind it.
"It wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, so it was not possible to achieve it," he said.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to the prohibition of nuclear weapons in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[New York Joint] On the 26th of the United Nations Headquarters in New York, a meeting was held to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.
The next day, five new countries ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and ratified it in 32 countries and regions.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons.
Secretary General Guterres also spoke, and in recent years he expressed a strong concern that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is no other way to eliminate it."
China needs strong leadership, and if there is no need for collapse, policy documents
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In the White Paper, the National Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified strong leadership, China will go to division and collapse, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratization movement that occurred in Beijing in 1989.
President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the control of the party since he held the government in late 2012.
Mr. Shu has also directed a military modernization program that threatens the region.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development model, nor does it intend to adopt a model of other countries, but merely seek peace rather than supremacy.
Some Chinese genes do not invade or control the world.
In modern times, China was bullied by column forces, and the war and chaos left a deep scar with its pain; China would never make the pain that he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as the sluggish economy and the anti-government movement in Hong Kong in China.
The White Paper states that China will never abandon its core interests and will not allow the loss of security and sovereignty.
"There is no problem with any tariffs that continue to rise with the threat of trade war," says White Paper in connection with trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with a complete industrial system, full industrial chain, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"It will never be weakened by the trade war."
I am convinced that China has the power to face difficulties, change the crisis into opportunities, and open a new world.
Since China has no idea to counter the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., the U.S. should calmly capture the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, suppress, and move the contradictions of other countries abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director of Kaneko.
Takahiro Yokohama, a famous high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he was relieved by Toru Hirata (36) and Masami Kaneko (42).
In the future, Oteru Takayama will be acting as a coach and the director (responsive teacher) will promptly decide.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that local newspapers had an appeal to baseball players.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's neck and the director Kimko admitted some of the rumors.
In addition, in light of the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and the fact was generally accepted as facts.
In the summer of 1515, Motochizen WATANABE (74) directed by Daisuke MATSUSAKA (present-day Nakanichi) and others retired.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
He played in Kokoen in summer for three consecutive years from the summer of 16th to the present spring Senbatsu.
However, after losing to Sagamihara in the semi-finals in the summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semi-finals in autumn and was desperate for the next spring.
The Spice Girls' MelC, the Severage Disorder, and the Diet's topic is banned in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, who had been unable to eat anything other than fruits and vegetables for many years, admitted that their diet was banned at home.
The sporty spices were diagnosed with depression and eating disorders after long periods of exercise without having to eat well under pressure from members of the global pop group.
Chizom explained that his experience was influenced by the child rearing of his beloved daughter Scarlett, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old, and I'm getting distracted by my appearance."
But because I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when I talked with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's customs.
In the 1990s, when he became a member of Spice Girls, he was still in the front of SNSdai, when a "bad" comment on himself written in the media led to a physical problem, Mel spoke in a magazine Women's Health interview.
"I'm not going to take care of myself properly, and I'm getting rid of certain food groups and getting more and more exercised, so I'm too thin."
I'm sorry for my health, and that's almost a few years."
The judgment of the same-sex marriage justice and the opportunity to expand diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch made a decision to acknowledge the fact that "in fact marriage" in accordance with marriage was a dispute between the same sex.
More than 20 countries recognize same-sex marriages, and there is no legal effect in Japan.
The decision was made to determine the reality of marriage between two women.
It is considered the first judicial decision to recognize the legal protection of the same sex couples and is meaningful.
There are five lawsuits, such as Sapporo, for which the same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Register Act, which require compensation to the country as unconstitutional.
In order to overcome the ruling, I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities, and deepen discussions on the legal system of recognizing diverse families.
Females lived in the United States for about seven years and obtained a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The decision was certified as "the reality of the fact that marriage between men and women is not the same."
It is an epoch-making decision to expand the recognition of marriage with the right to conform to marriage in social insurance.
In addition, it is important to express the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution to "freedom of marriage" as the marriage "only based on the mutual agreement."
Both sexes have been described as "it is not clear to the purpose of denying the same-sex marriage because the same-sex marriage was not assumed at the time of establishment."
"The Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," but it is expected that it will be a driving force for the same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, there was still a problem with reducing the amount of compensation as "the benefits of legal protection between men and women differ."
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect while recognizing the actual situation equivalent to between men and women.
There are also changes in the public's awareness, including about 70% of people who consider marriage to be legally recognized by married women.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, the law is bound by traditional family statues to take away the rights of people who are not fit.
In fact, marriage is not a spouse who admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the absence of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family laws from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriage between sexes, but also the expansion of legal rights for marriage.
a former athlete's trial and jury trial for rape against multiple women.
A jury trial was held at the former Delaware University baseball player's trial, where multiple women were charged with sexual assault.
On Friday, after 10 days of testimony and speech, the jury began a review of Craig Conaway's fortune.
A 21-year-old woman tells her that she was sexually assaulted after she was sent to her home by car.
After three weeks of meeting with Bumble, Conaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecutors argued that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women's paradoxical claims and memory differences would have regretted having physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure and said, "The next season is the Penantential Deportation" (Sport News) - Yahoo!
In the third round, Hiroshima was defeated in the final round of the season, and there was no possibility that he could enter CS with his own power.
If the player wins the final three games, they will be replaced.
At the ceremony after the match, the director of Ogata Ko City (50) said, "I'm sorry that I couldn't win the final match and I couldn't confirm my position.
Some fans were invited to join.
In addition, at the end of the greeting, he said, "I will do my best to steal Penantu next season."
At the end of the ceremony, however, he was asked by the press about the event, saying, "I'm not finished yet, so I'll do everything."
[Dospo] Ota was the first to be transferred to the Hokkaido Shimbun, and he succeeded to the teaching of the retired Sanematsu & G Abe.
It was "returned" to the seniors.
He took the lead four times, and on the left side of the liner, he made his 20th home run this season.
I reached the number of home runaways that I had been aiming for, "I stopped this number and tried to do it again, and I became a big one."
The director's intention was also firm.
It was the first time since the transfer.
He said, "I put it in the fourth place so I could swing."
Oda responded to his expectations: "I feel that I've been in the game, and I've spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the four ideal statues is ABE, a giant who retired from active service this season.
"The 4th is the core that will lead the victory, and the 4th of the team will be the 4th, and the 4th seniors who have seen the giants were the same."
Among them, "I think Abe's appearance is the best, and it's a dependable existence, and I look at that back and I'm in my style."

it's a serious pollution of popular tourist spots, and it's clearly shown in videos.
Sydney Harbour is one of the largest tourist resources in Sydney, with an annual Australian economy of US$209 million, and is home to opera houses, cerculer keys, Luna Park, and some famous harbor bridges.
But under the bridge there is ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of the worst waterways in Australia, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow every year in the Olympic pool.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title, "From Sydney Harbor to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities often flow into the Sydney Harbour by wet shells, plastic bags, plastic bottles, shoes, clothes and even animal dead bodies.
Among them, plastics are the biggest factor to break the waterway.
Dr. Catherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is a paradox."
Although its appearance is certainly beautiful, it is one of the mouths of the river which has been greatly modified and contaminated in Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbor via rainwater drains.
"There were several heavy rains, but after that, Sydney Harbor was pretty tragic," Dr. Duffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, in a corner of the iceberg, 70 percent of plastics flowing into the ocean are deposited in the ocean floor.
"I really don't know what the truth is if I don't go down the sea level, but I don't know what it is," said Richard Nichols, owner, Daibu Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is there under the water surface), I think everyone is really cool.
It's overwhelming, but more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
The remaining half of the plastic is used somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone can't believe that all plastics and garbage are flowing down the water immediately.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of Ocean Protet, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce plastics and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the use of plastics, recycles more well, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, and the pain in the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a source of food.
However, we repair Sydney Harbor and return it back to the old scene, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing humans.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also announced this month, as part of the activities of the Australian public to widely know about environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new survey, 82 percent of the 546 children from 12 to 18 years old have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
In the same study, both parents and parents ranked fourth in concerns about plastic waste, and reported that 93 percent of the parents surveyed felt increasingly uneasy about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
Former Karatsu Power Plant Co., Ltd. in October | Government and Society | Saga News | Saga Shimbun
In October, the demolition work began at the former Karatsu Power Plant.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Plant (oil-fired power plant) located in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantlement was about 180 meters high, which was used to discharge gas during power generation.
The original three were removed in 1991.
The chimney is split from the top of the tower crane and dismantled.
The plan requires a total of 18 months for each decomposition.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
"When I look back at the chimney, I feel like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu."
The former Karatsu Power Plant began operating in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because it is close to the prefectural yacht harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.
Product development with local fish Owashi Taka Fishnuts and other sales Mie - Ise Shimbun
[Students who promote fishnaggets and rice cooked in Thailand]Owashi High School in Furuno-cho, Owashi City
[Owashi] Four third-year students from the Prefectural Owashi High School Information Business Department in Kodono-cho, Owashi City, Mie Prefecture developed fish naggets and rice cooked in Thailand using fish that are fried locally.
It was sold at the school's Cultural Festival on June 26.
This project is part of the satellite high-level collaboration project in Higashikishu, Mie University, which aims to revitalize the water industry, forestry and other industries in the region of Higashiki.
The newly developed product is fish naggets made from mutts that are caught in Kumano Nada, and rice cooked using fish rice grown in Owashi.
They were targeting young people.
Fishnaggets have developed three types of tofu, tofu, and gas shrimp from the tail eagle.
Kumano Fishery Co-operatives cooperated in the process of Yugi-cho, Kumano City.
Thai cooking rice mixed with shiitake and carrot.
Kodono-cho (Kodono-cho, Owashi City) is in charge of cooking.
Classes began in June.
They visited factories in Owashi and deepened their understanding of the water industry.
At the workshop, we talked about consumer needs and tried prototypes.
He also invented naggets using hydrangeas, but because of the peculiar smell of fish, he adopted mutts.
Mr. Masaki Yamaguchi (17) said, "It's a product that can be eaten by people who are not good at fish, and I'm glad that many people can eat it."
It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell goods.
It's because I'm passionate about my love (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Mr. Mama Takahashi, a free announcer, told his master about the monthly commentator on CBC TV "Chat!."
the teacher's advice was to save him.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a master beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I don't know what I'm doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important to me as a working person.
I finally became an announcer of the TV station with a 120% effort, but when I was told to be a conet or a buzzer, my father said, "I thought it was a net, but I didn't think it was.
After that, when I joined the company in the second and third year, I was only working "Anyone with an empty woman is good," and when I wasn't motivated by what I wanted to do, my heart was rotting.
i read the news that i learned naturally from my father's play.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but in fact, after I joined the TV station, I've been in touch with the news all the time with the narration of BS and news shows.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe was happy and confident that he was "very good at reading the news of Mama."
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sensed.
It is cultivated by watching his father's stage, movies, TVs, and period dramas during his childhood.
In other words, I think it is thanks to my father because I have a lot of experiences in my childhood.

The World Rally Championship was held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round was held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Looking back at the past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
(18)
The final event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is WRC that will revive in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which Formula One (F1) and World Endurance Championship are held.
Since 1973, it has become the world's highest rally championship with history and tradition, and it is said that the competition will be the most demanding car competition because it is not only closed public roads (paved roads), but also various road surfaces such as gravel roads and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.) is talking about the Japan Round.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work hard to achieve the success of the 2020 Fall Games in cooperation with the relevant parties to make a big appeal to the world as the center of motorsports in Japan."
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
I am very pleased that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament in the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you today.
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very pleased to be able to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support.
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Federation for Motorsport Promotion, commented on the Japanese round.
The WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Kurarakucho) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakazugawa City and Ebisu City).
The main venue is the "Love Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
In addition to meeting the decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is it the key to cancer treatment?
Tusmaniadeville may have the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could bring great reform to patient treatment.
Medical researchers found how some cancer cells were camouflaged.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmania Devil and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will create a new method for cancer treatment.
What are the similarities between Tasmania Devil and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
The team, including researchers at the Peter McClellan Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to working on a fatal face tumor that threatens the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
In this study, we found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 (PRC2) to cause markers to react and immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and Merkel cells.
"The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who have been resistant to immunotherapy," said Mark Dowson, researcher at Peter McClum.
Reuse traditional therapies and revitalizing markers, i.e., proteins known as MHC, may enable immune systems to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," said Dowson.
"The lung cancer is a disease in the world.
And you might be able to treat it in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used in the treatment of face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils, where cancer cells escape detection.
"Unexpectedly, there will be exactly the same process (to humans and Tasmanian devils)," Dr. Doson said.
"It was very difficult to treat Tusmaniadeville tumors.
However, if a drug that is effective in humans can be used in Tasmaniadeville, it may be useful to control the tumor."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting polar stars.
Scientists have discovered the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation by orbiting a giant Jupiter-like planet around a small star called Red dwarf, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of a giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting a red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the size of stars and planets is not large, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"That's another surprise," said Juan Carlos Morales, an astronomical physicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, who led this research published in Science.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Coloral Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only quite small than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, the surface temperature is much lower than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I'm red."
While there is a sign that the second planet orbits the star, Morales explained that the third planet may have been released from its star system in the past.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gases and dust, which generate stars orbiting themselves.
The most powerful planetary formation model, known as the "core accumulation" model, generates objects from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes the atmosphere by pulling the eggs of the planet.
This unusual planetary system can be explained using conflict models called self-gravity instability models.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature was lower."
Since the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses may grow until they collapse and form planets.
i'm going to eat a soy dip with a delicate employee and an awakening agent for prosecution.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernandes (38) is accused of eating dipping beans with awakening agents to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Animina Hernández (38) was accused of the transfer of methane fetamine, a B-class heavy offense, and the suspicion of taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were attributed to the incident that occurred at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on 9 September.
According to the estimate of the affidavit from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked me to make a little taste because Medina Hernández saw him making beans dip.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamin before, "I thought it would taste strange after I ate it, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach became worse and her legs were fluffy.
According to Albanie Demoklat Herald, a local hospital where women went was judged to have had methane phetamin in soy dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said that Medina Hernández told the victim's food "to put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane fetamine into beans dip.
According to the Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows that Medina Hernández is stuck in the back of the camera and behind the microwave.
It is said that he was standing up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table to put the beans dip in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brager were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff said that there were no customers who had been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was jailed in Marion County instead of $250,000 bail.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has had a history of assault, robbery, suffrage, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Enable Challenges" President of JR Tokai, emphasis on early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on the 27th, Mr. Kinko, President of JR Tokai, commented on the issue of the decrease in flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen Nan Alps tunnel, "It is better to separate the issues that arise in consultation with Shizuoka Prefecture from the start of construction, and that it is better to separate them from the start of construction."
He said, "We're going to talk about the meeting place and the front stage."
President Kaneko said, "It's not easy to start with a lot of problems after all, and I think it's possible to divide such issues."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our thinking, we have to talk about it."
The prefectural side is concerned that the spring water that came out during the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that it would be difficult to think about it from the safety side of the construction.
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the change of route mentioned was "not possible."
Regarding the impact of the opening period, President Kaneko pointed out three locations: Minami Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station as a place to take a particularly long time for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Government and Society|Saga Newspaper News | Saga Shimbun
Five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced the hospital's name on 26 March that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare needed reorganisation and integration.
The population of 13 medical institutions in the prefecture is 38 and 5%, which is the tenth highest in the country, and three have already been consolidated and transferred.
The name of the hospital in the prefecture is Higashi Saga Hospital of the National Hospital Organization (Miyaki Town, Mie Prefecture), Takyu Municipal Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Citizen's Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), which promotes regional medical functions, and Taramachi Tara Hospital in Fujitsu County.
The city plans to build a new hospital in Higashi-Takyu-cho, Takyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community-wide care in the town, and has been operating surpluses for several years.
Mr. Takayuki Nagabuchi stressed that "the town itself operates alone and has a view to working with hospitals in neighboring towns, and hospitals must be left absolutely for residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The director of the office at Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "We don't listen to the contents from the prefecture," and he said, "We will actively participate in the Regional Medical Initiative Coordination Conference in the prefecture and respond to it based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Regional Medical Function Promotion Agency (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not a mechanical decision to determine the direction of public hospitals, but a request was made to reconsider the direction of regional medical planning meetings in each prefecture."
"I would like to hear from the parties about the future hospital operation.
In some cases, it may be necessary to review medical subjects and to further reduce the sickbed."

Mrs. Obama posted a photo of Mrs. Megan, who poses with the executive of the Foundation, adding that "Even with the interview with the executive of the Obama Foundation, the support of girls around the world who seek appropriate education is stimulating to many people."
She served as guest editor in the September issue of Vogue magazine and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In a frank conversation, former President Mrs. Motonaga recalled how her mother and mother changed her.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "My mother is like being in an advanced class to let go."
My job was almost always as my mother to find myself that children want to grow and keep a suitable distance.
In order to find out who they are, in essence, are not the ideals for children as parents or the admiration of their childhood.
Mrs. Obama, who actually knows the pressure on spotlights in the world, advised the duchess little by little in the interview of Good Housekeeping magazine.
sometimes the pressure from yourself and people around you can feel too big.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't have time to do anything.

Trump Hotel owner's right to complain, but also holds a license to sell liquor.
Washington (AP) - The Commission on Alcohol and Drinks in Washington State dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license for the sale of liquors at the local Trump International Hotel, as the owner has questioned the suitability.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three legislators, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders that most of the petitioners were entitled to appeal because they were not living in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, it is the second time that an appeal to the cancellation of the right to provide alcohol at the Hotel was made based on the State Law, which requires the applicant to obtain a license for selling alcohol.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year included repeated deceptions against Trump's assault and violating state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This is the second time that the license was renewed.

Peter Bosch, director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant this year.
The beekeepers watched the scene from wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains where the bees are gathering various flowers.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful that there is so much harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities as much as possible to the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers through its Crew Plant and our business.
Staff members are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of betrace honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to play our own role in the future."In May 2019, 12 million bees of honeybees were started.
In September of the same year, after the summer, the nest was removed from the nest box.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen as Bentley's specialty.
The label design was designed by Louise McClum, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is distributed not only to the staff but also to the important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
We would like to enjoy afternoon tea, not only Fenner Tea, which is compatible with honey, but also the bees of FlyingBees, such as corn.
The Cleveland Police, who continued the scandal, reported the worst in the United Kingdom in a violent report.
The police, who followed the scandal, issued a letter from the inspector to the British.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud in all areas inappropriately.
The Cleveland Police continued to "deeply deteriorate" and the police director Phil Gomley said.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to stop the crime, arrest the suspect and protect the vulnerable.
The police director Phil Gomley said, "It's been a long time since we finally investigated it."
The police chief Mike Vil resigned in January, less than a year before his appointment, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for multiple charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was arrested for serious illegal acts and suspended.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee for the illegal act, for reasons that he had worked with his colleagues for sexual acts.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
It's time for the Interior Ministry to intervene."
The police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Bar was "criminalized" and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what's going on.
At present, we believe that we are involved in a cover-up case, and it may take some time to investigate."
"We're going to do a job that we're starting to do based on the facts and the time to discover facts," said Pelosi.
This week's White House record revealed that Trump asked President Vladimir Zerensky of Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudi Giuliani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN first noticed internal accusations against Trump's actions involving Ukraine over a week prior to formal inquiries on Thursday.
The Ministry of Justice, who was charged as an inquiry by information agencies, decided that Trump's telephone talks would not be covered by political fund violations.
In response to the question that Mr. Bar should testify, Pelosi stated Friday that he would decide who the Special Committee of the Intelligence will call witnesses.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," said Pelosi, and he touched on Trump's name on the telephone meeting with the Ukrainian president in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will approach the judgment regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" when Trump attacked the whistleblower on Thursday as a spy.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Pelosi stated that the whistleblower plays an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to the whistleblower is a significant loss in the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump for impeachment and wrote a historical step.
The content of the call is included in the accusations released on Thursday, in which the whistleblower claims that Trump abused the job rights to seek intervention in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that the White House advisers instructed officials to remove calls from the cabinet-level computer system and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Benteque, nonstop driving in violation of speed.
The Premier League star, Christian Benteke, who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, was banned from driving.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old forward allowed her to drive her Bentley on January 20, and to drive her 50 miles per hour at a speed limit of A3 in Richmond, southwest London.
In March, the Belgians then shot a speed violation control camera in Patney, southwest London, driving at 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Benteque, living in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Lavender Hill Court of Justice this morning.
At the beginning of July, Benteque was convicted of the two violations under a single trial, which allowed one justice to hear the judgment of light crimes.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the review committee
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasccus, expressed concern about the composition of the review committee for the next Ghana Football Association (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davis and expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In the interview with GNA Sport, Mr. Manu stated that the chairman had an interest in the results of the judging process, and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside of the previous interest, whether it is a relationship with each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Palmer about 10% compensation.
He is also known as Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, Manuel argued that he had interests, and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if the Olympic Board member Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be conflict of interest on the chairman's side from the relationship with the club, but when Palmer attended the committee, he suggested that he was biased and unfair.
The members of the committee were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after taking office at the GFA Akra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales Director, and lawyer Richard Akpocavi.
The survey of the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture believe that the minimum wage should be 1,000 yen.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of plans was around 50% for new graduates and mid-term employees, and 30% for non-regular employees.
The number of companies that answered "approved" was 100 percent, construction (70-60%), and wholesale (61-70%).
The majority of the respondents were manufacturers (51-90%) and service businesses (60-90%), including food and drink, and accommodation (60,9 percent).
The representative at the conference said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with a high part and a high amount of time.
The average amount of money was 895 yen (from 4 October to 829 yen in Fukui Prefecture).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 19, the hiring of a new employee was 61/3 percent, the mid-term employment was 54-5 percent, and the non-regular employment was 15-4%.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number was 44,7 percent, 50 and 3 percent, and non-regulars remained 31 and 1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (new graduates 13 and 3 percent, juniors 37 and 5 percent) and construction work (24, 1 percent of new graduates, 38 and 1 percent) struggled.
A total of 86.4% of the respondents had challenges in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the company's reputation was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (departures within three years after graduation).
There was also a view to encouraging students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the government's sub-sectoral and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied, "I already admit."
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total acceptance attitude was expressed.
The companies that "not admitted" were 64 and 4%, with construction (82,8%), retail (73,1%), and manufacturing (72,7%).
The survey was conducted between July 19 and August 2 for 1,000 member companies.

Timplick, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy.
Justin Tiprick said, "It's a place to show you now."
If Wales won the Wallads, he would be the most hot winner of the Pool D, and probably the semi-final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, who had previously played 15 against Wales, would win 14 against Wales, Tiprick and his team would be one straight line for England's best eight.
"It's natural, I want both teams to challenge and win at the top of the group, and I want to end."
Although the fight against Australia had been severe, it was good to win in autumn last year.
Australia thinks it will be a lot of blame for returning the loan, but until we try to make sure we win again.
I knew it was a mountain before I came here.
And I came here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa in the past World Cup, and the victory to Wallady is the third-place victory of 32 years ago.
Under Warren Gatland's supervision, the team's total score for the Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight 3 team was only 7 in 41.
Wales stopped last November at 13 Test Match Australia, but Tiprick was included in a number of representative members who won the match 9-6 and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium on this Sunday.
He said, "It's hard to answer."
I'm sure the match was good, and maybe I thought that everyone should win, but I don't know well.
As a result, I had a score of about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be a very narrow score than actually."
In order to win Wales, the key is the breakdown battle between Michael Hoover and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Back Lo.
Tiprick, who has previously played 67 international matches, has experienced several matches and two players in the past, and knows what they are waiting for.
"They're definitely a global backs player," he says.
When you play against the background of the world glass, you'll always know that you're going to face a tough game.
They are always at the highest level in the world.
So you know what kind of game you're going to play.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in the defensive battle, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense of having to go to the right place when needed.
I want to fight against the world's best player and increase myself.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against the two, you have to keep up with yourself.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important match for us.
momentum is important.
If you continue to build up a good performance, you will be able to play a game that won't lose on the momentum.

In East Enders, the column highway (Tony Clay) was surprised by Whitney Dean's sudden bomb news, so the column returned to the original of the mistress, and the hot tension between the column and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowen) was about to explode.
But will the relationship between the two begin?

Is it true that if Yoshimoto Kogyo has 90 percent of Gala, it will be a gift from comedians?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo, which triggered the dark business of antisocial forces, have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto spoke at the press conference on July 22, saying, "The company is 9 and there is no talent at all."
If the ratio of "9:1" is 90 percent to Yoshimoto, it is considered that there was a gift from comedians to Yoshimoto, and the view of investors who were paying taxes is also on Twitter, which has been retweeted more than 30,000 times.
If Galla's deal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was asked by Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to a gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual, it is not the subject of gift tax in the first place.
If it was "9:1," Yoshimoto's sales amounted to ¥100,000 and the cost of ¥10 million.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax declarations and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you are wondering about allocation, you don't argue that the amount you actually receive is different from the original amount.
And I think the amount you received will be declared as sales.
If the person who gave the gift is not aware of it, it would not be a gift if he was an individual.
It is a matter of calculating taxes if you make transactions at prices that are clearly priced (e.g., real estate sales, etc.) away from the original market for tax avoidance purposes.
However, as this time, third parties will not be able to decide on how much tax appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen payment book is a poison.
[Interview cooperation tax accountant] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working as a bank, after graduating from university, he registered as a tax accountant in 2008.
There are a wide range of activities such as university lecturers, seminars and writing.
It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for accounting beginners.
the white house, the impeachment is a big panic.
White House officials were eager to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and detailed officials in this issue explained that there was a "big panic" feeling for a week in response to the lack of plans to deal with the emerging reality.
The person close to the White House stated that the appeal of the whistleblowers seemed to be increasing in concern, anxiety, and anxiety about the atmosphere of the West Building.
He said, "I don't think it's true."
The White House officials were joking about the lack of clear plans for this situation, and the fact that the normal measures that the President has made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied, the more serious this claim is, so there was no confidence in how to proceed, "It seems not to be erased from the news reported next."
Another person familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state with a great shock" because the President's response to this impeachment would increase the likelihood of being "punished."
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the President is expected to be raised every day, and some of the close associates of the President are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has spurred concerns about the increasingly unpredictable behavior and the possibility of aggressive attacks by unexpected means, and is concerned about President and politics in the environment of election year.
Trump has faced the greatest threat ever before in his presidential term, and has transformed himself into a counter-attack or into a defense, such as reviving the strategy that Robert Morler has judged himself effective during the Russian investigation.
Trump tried to take a light look at the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate with the investigation of political enemies, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and the presidential candidate Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblowers as a motive for factional conflicts.
However, many of the White House officials have endured Morler's trials, but this time they began to feel the difference, and they said.
Although he was a brand president, he seemed to be in the press conference on Wednesday, and he said he was familiar with this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers have been aware of the fact that President Trump, Vladimir Zerensky, and President of Ukraine did not have direct information on the call, claiming that it would undermine the credibility of the whistleblower and are convinced that damage can be reduced.
Furthermore, it is often happens when the President is attacked, but the momentum of the support layer increases to defend against such facts.
However, Republican strategic families close to the White House point out that the basic support rate of the President is already very high and the effect of impeaching new supporters will not be much.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those claiming that impeachment could help the President did not fully understand how the President's response would be a deterministic factor.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the plan, this initiative is still in the early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of action such as the strategic decision room will be implemented.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have a clear leader who can organize public relations activities aggressively in order to counter the publication of organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, and the momentum that critical internal accusations were given to the Democratic impeachment.
According to some sources, the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munshin, who expressed that they would not publish a note on the call with the Ukrainian president of Trump 48 hours later.
It is expected that the pressure will increase even more now than Robert Morler's investigation, who only spoke through the indictment, according to the person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitble of Trump and the Corrie Luwanduski, who served as the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwanduski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"I've been doing everything I can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but I've never talked with the President and his close associates about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney Jay Cellow is also involved in impeachment efforts.
In an interview with NBC News, Cellow replied, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmet Fladd, who was involved in the impeachment of Clinton and led the White House until the end of the Morler investigation, left Pat Cipolon, the current White House legal adviser, without such experience, and the White House currently lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
For more information on the White House's strategy, it is generally recognized that the parties are far from recruiting and building a strategic team, but must be organized and able to lead all the efforts to respond and political struggle.

I said, "Let's marry someday," but I can't see the goal and I can't see it.
How can we connect the situation with our allies to marriage?
Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa of Waseda University gave a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice and reading from detailed data analysis.
this is my concern.
I'm worried about continuing my relationship with my boyfriend in distant love.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I have work and my family, but his work is in Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office).
The couple who got married from a distant love is a minority.
The Nikkei Doors Editor (hereafter -) C is in love with a boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also a word "to be tested in distance and the two will be stronger," but in the first place, is the distance love going well?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter, Morikawa) Speaking of distance love, the survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the other person (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touching), smelling (no smell), kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there is a big half case to hear the voice on the phone.
It may be difficult to keep working with hearing only in situations.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to an opponent's house, you'll be burdened with the time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if you're on a holiday to heal the tiredness of your work, your body will be a factor.
When I return home, I feel comfortable.
Isn't it the only way to break away?
Morikawa I think it will work if there are couples who can endure even if they don't meet frequently, or couples who are determined in advance for a distance.
I'm married a year later, or I'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you don't see a future landing point.

debin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request.
Senator Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, in a comment to defend the President, he condemned the Democratic Party to attempt to get the presidential nude photo.
Members of the House Information Special Committee of the Republican Party, Nunes, filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about the internal charges Trump asked for the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son to investigate.
The member accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the full naked picture of the President, stating that Ukrainian suspicions were "grotesque shows" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democratic Party of the Special Committee negotiated with the Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It is natural that everyone asks why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the President, and that there is a chance within a year.
After the scolding of Nunes, the senior political reporter of the Huff post, Jennifer Bendilly, decided to examine whether the Democrats were trying to find the truth.
It was only the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, Jim Heizes, but many other members questioned whether the answer was a naked truth.
Medire Dotcom speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more detailed and unidentified details" that are said to have been written in the steel document.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected shocking claims against Trump, in one room in Moscow's hotel, where Trump is projected to see the urination of prostitutes, referring to the "Okko Tape" which suggests existence.
Origami, wallet and real card.

The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services said, "We will create new financial services to solve the problems of the younger generation who need to live in a variety of problems such as pensions and low interest rates," adding that "for example, we want to provide services that are equally useful for people who have been alienated from financial services and those who have not benefited from the system until now."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origami ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and provide timely information.
He also explained that it would be possible to deploy not only on the Origami app but also on partner companies' apps.
Regarding loans, we introduce functions that can be used to pay after payment in conjunction with settlement.

New business for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support effective utilization of data, including data held by companies, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its payment function provided by Origami.
Origami recognizes that effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge for partner companies, such as sales and settlement functions, such as acquisition of structured data and unstructured data in real society, accumulation, processing and analysis of data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports the acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with its payment data and structured data owned by its partner companies.
It aims to contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.

renewable biofuel research can reduce emissions.
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only flight to fly in the sky and the only aircraft to be able to reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta developed a technology to use renewable biofuels as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, launched the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory has developed hydrocarbon fuel from lipid waste such as oil fat, livestock rendering, and Canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low-quality fats in production, while carbon emissions are less than 85% lower than crude oil-based fuels, and other industrial waste can be used during production.
This technique also acts as a reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude fuel.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline.
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems in aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma," said Bresler.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as a biofuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bresler explained the second option: "You can try the reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Fortune Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They expect someone to impose carbon tax in the future."
I would like to prepare a substitute for the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a production facility of $22 million in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 1 million liter of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher in terms of fuel transport and production.
"As a technology store," says Bresler.
My job is to create an option so that you can make multiple choices in parallel with the decision given.

Boris Johnson warns that if Brexit is over, Britain faces riots like Los Angeles, the prime minister calls for calmness.
A senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a danger that "the violent riots by the people" would occur in this country.
The high-ranking officials of the prime minister warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that it was necessary to "teach anger" against political words exchanged with intense speech, but insisted that the term "default" would not be used.
Despite the appeal of the prime minister to regain his calmness, one cabinet said to Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gilles Joan or the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement - they're encrypting mobile phones and organizing demonstrations, and then a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when the jury sentenced four white cops who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to acquitted verdict.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstration participant Zire Joan, wearing the eye-catching yellow vest, has caused confusion and destruction in Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed to Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives, stating that if the United Kingdom failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be catastrophic.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, the 10 million people would be dissatisfied."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, they would not give up by writing letters to the House of Representatives.
It's not much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum would cover the first outcome, there would be a danger that "strong riots by the people" would occur in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to have been facing the House's Rebellion, seeking to lower the demands for EU withdrawal and instead hit the EU with compromises.

Pakistani social media celebrity brother named honor murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is often prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderers are bailed and the memory of the incident is reduced.
"It's time-consuming, so people forget" women's rights activist Farzana Bali, the first gender faculty founder of Pakistan's university, added that it took more than three years to solve even the Barochi incident, which is attracting attention.
Although human rights organizations say that it is difficult to prove reliable data, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "religious murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the actual number of honorable homicides is much more than that, but it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorary homicides occurring every year around the world are occupied by Pakistan.

Floods and disruptions caused by monsoons in many areas
The Monsoon season in India is about a month long, with unprecedented rainfall, buildings collapse and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoon in northern India usually weakens its forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month has increased by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, Monsoon will weaken in the last few decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune in western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays caused the collapse of the building to be disastrous.
The houses were flooded, and the residents took water to the knees to cross the street, usually seen only at the peak of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Laguna and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rain.
In northern Utah, heavy rains have caused significant damage to homes.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
Water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for the possibility of drought.
Monsoons are not desirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Bimtal, Uttalakand, said, "We are making cabbage, beans, peas, tomatoes, but vegetables are rotting in rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that can't be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow Monsoon influence.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, onions of 20 rupees (23 pens) are usually sold at 80 rupees (about 1 pound).
The festival is also in danger.
The next big festival is Dašera on 8 October, and the Hindus set up Ravana, an evil laugh figure of a beard that appears in the huge comic book-style doll, epic "Lamaryana."
The burning of Ravana means that good destroys evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if the monsoon is pulled long, it may be that the last laugh is Ravana.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides and risk of heart disease and heart attack
The latest research shows that working around a high concentration of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This is the result of a survey of Japanese-American kloops in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared with a group of men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides at work, writing medical records about the presence of pesticide exposure in work, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the research.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manora.
This is the result of the study of data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu, who participated in the Qui Akini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this study may not be applied to women and other races because it is only for Japanese Americans.
Since pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years after exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years after exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably due to the growing importance of other factors related to aging and hiding the possible relationship between pesticides and mental disorders in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Zerrensky Trump's telephone meeting with Poloshenco intervention
The impeachment procedure for President Donald Trump was made, and it was a dramatic week in Washington's political affairs.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners Vladimir Zerensky.
But what has happened to Zellensky Trump's phone problems?
At the beginning of the telephone meeting, Trump told Zelensky that the United States has made many conveniences in Ukraine from other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail as being criticized by Trump that Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders were devoted to speaking rather than concrete proposals.
The response of Zerensky, who opposed Trump 100% rather than 1000 percent, is considered controversial.
Zerensky added that both Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian president Petro Poloshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for the support received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the support of the EU's sanctions and economic assistance during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voivoticus said, "Is it possible to negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Following Trump's request for military assistance and two investigations, not one, to Zerensky, the first is to ask Joe Baiden's son Hunter, and the second is to investigate the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic e-mail intrusion during the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would interfere with European relations, or whether the French and German leaders would lay back water.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
"I'm grateful to those who helped me with the announcement of the call record."
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana and the International Civil Aviation Organization won two awards.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The award was awarded to Ghana, who won an effective implementation rate of 89.89% and was awarded the highest score in Africa by air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019, following the United Nations Air Force's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was approved by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding the safety of the airport and its own air.
These awards were created as part of the support of the ICAO Zero Campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications and 17 certifications were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Cofi Ada Ghana, Simon Alati, Director of Civil Aviation in Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aico Otou to Canada, and Director of the Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
The Chairman of the Council of International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Benad Aliu, emphasized the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries in the speech.
"It is important to continue to realize that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also stated that the award is a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's impending efforts and patience.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry had a great future to develop the domestic economy as "airs are likely to change our lives dramatically."
There are social and economic benefits, but they all have safety and security that we have achieved.

Trump and Peter Gateau appointed FEMA Chief Officer: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Secretary of State for Emergency Management, Peter Gateau smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Council at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington (Royter Communications) - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gateau as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Director of FEMA, was the deputy director of the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes and fires.

The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, stated that Mr. Long had illegally used the government's public car to commute to work between Washington and his home Noor Carolinea.
Mr. Jeffrey Baird, who was already nominated for one, brought up suspicions that he was drunk in alcohol and involved in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of the month after consideration.
Mr. Gateau's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of Senate approvals are required.
Before taking office as Deputy Secretary of FEMA in 2018, Gateau stated that he was on duty at the Emergency Management Bureau in Rhode Island and was a naval soldier.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down the illegal marijuana baying business in San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity in San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m. on suspicion of selling illegal marijuana pens, large containers of botan honey oil (rich cannabis oil) were discovered at office buildings located in 9600 blocks on Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found equipment packed with bayp cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
Lieutenant Cano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigations and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used for Bayp products.
"The static electricity from clothes can only be ignited, and because it is concentrated, it will cause fire as well as explosions."
In addition, if there were multiple containers like A, there was a possibility that the entire building would be blown away not only by explosions one after another, but also by fire.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
He received an anonymous information and told the investigators that it led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still pursuing who is the black curtain of illegal Bayp activities.
The police said that the office was empty, so Zhang himself thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that they would like to take recent news, especially about the dangers of bating, to tend to be illegal bating products and not go out.
Captain Cano said, "It's a substitute that you don't know whether it's real or not.
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our community and children, so police have always warned people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there is a huge earthquake with 6 intensity!
Evacuation Training at the Hall of Miyazaki City - Yahoo! News
A practical evacuation drill was conducted at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held every year.
At the stage, there is a performance by the Miyazaki Fire Department, and it is assumed that there will be a 6-strong earthquake in the middle of the song.
Approximately 300 people participated in training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff.

Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I.
It was woven with silver foil silk made of the finest camlet silk, and the gorgeous embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Herstic Royal Palace dress collection curator, Eli Lin, has decided to be one point.
Lin saw this faded piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in one country, which was placed there 100 years ago, and it is thought to be part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this gorgeous cloth used as the altarpiece of the church in Bactton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited at Hampton Court Palace next month, near exactly that room where the Queen of Tudor could wear over 450 years ago.
Other than the rest of the 16th century dresses, it is clear that the entire royal dress collection was an important discovery.
Although there was no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing through the sleeves in his dress, he was convinced by the experts that the dress was not part of the royal possession for three years.
The silver threaded cloth was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but it also suggests that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later was noble.
It seems that the dress was the price equivalent to one house in the Tudor style.
In addition, it is speculated that in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, the Queen would be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or would not be tolerated by rivals wearing such gorgeous clothing.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues.
When I saw the cloth, I was always happy to hear that it was amazing, and I was convinced that I was looking at one of the royal dresses."
The long second life of a dress used as an altarpiece of the Holy Face Church of Bakton, cut off and blind, seems unexpected but not so.
Bactton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and is said to have long been associated with Parley.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, she must have been presented to her family or church as a memorial to Paley.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and a very delicate hand sewn altar cloth will be exhibited next to Elizabeth's portrait depicting a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition period.
The vast space as much as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, and the preservation work was done almost here, and Libby Thompson, who taught the work, said, "I feel really respect for the craftsmanship of the people who made it."
When you look at the embroidered embroidered on the back of the table, you will be very respectful to those who made it.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"We searched for the scope of the request for a week after the missing female child, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew and the volunteer men were missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It's a week since the first-year-old girl in elementary school was missing in a campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces, which had no clue yet, closed the search and withdrew.
The search for Ogura Misaki, a first-year student in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw as "the scope of the request was searched and searched."
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly on the slopes of the mountains and places of danger such as Sawa, but they could not grasp clues.
On the 27th, there was no way to find a 20-year-old man who volunteered to search for.
The police and fire are planning to continue searching from 6:30 am on 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, where voters were seeking to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the plaintiffs appealed for election invalidity, as the value of one vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared with the number of voters per member in Fukui Prefecture, the lowest in the country in July this year.
In the first oral statement of the 27th day at the Fukuoka High Court Miyazaki Branch, the plaintiff argued that "the value of one vote was inequality and constitutionality."
On the other hand, the defendant's prefectural election manager asked for a rejection of the bill as "not even though it was in a significant inequalities that had a problem with constitutionality."
The judgment is passed on 30 October.

A drone arrived at the space base and caught with a robot arm | Shizuoka Shimbun at ess
No. 8 of the drones arrived at the International Space Station.
From the bottom left, the robot arm of the station is growing.
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Kinotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA staff on 28th (JAXA)
On the night of 28th, Astronauts arrived near the station and captured the robot arm.
The aircraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by the control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the speed difference and closes to about 10 meters.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters in length is the flow that grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.

one third of the u.s. domestic drugs
After the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Control Department (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
Nearly 800 people died in Chicago last year in drug overdose.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA, commonly known as El Mencho, focuses on the Mexican drug king Nemecio Servantes.
"Mencho is the first person to ask for DEA and the top priority of the federal law enforcement agency in the United States."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $1 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forests were inundated.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva, is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, Cartel sold "a large amount of cocaine, methane fetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin."
El Mencho's neck was awarded $1,000.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and returned to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
Donahhe said that he actually owns his own special maneuvers.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by drug trafficking.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic, so it is necessary to wear protective clothing when handling.
At the manufacturing base, the seal of the solder is pressed in the bag of cocaine.
More than one third is expected to be made by El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahhe said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively capture the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone died, Donahhe said that it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, Playstation 4 surprise news, PS4 game was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to Last of As.
Some of the video footage of this new action game was presented to fans.
A few days after the final of As2 news, further details were announced.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in various ways.
Since the time of PSwan, the last of the as part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Notydog Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous work, the story is magnificent and complicated."
In this way, it was necessary to tell stories with many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game was very spectacular and did not enter a single blue ray, making it two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 includes one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it is not possible to ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs during the game contain the works of nostalgic notic dogs.
If the last of the as part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 limited to PS4, you will know more.
Those who have PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered with PS Plus and prepare for the sequel release.
Sony recently released the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like Last of As Remastered and want to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including popular character Erie backpacks and bracelet replicas, and bonus versions with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Save" Council attempts Residents wish to continue - Yahoo! News
On the 26th day of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased, mobile sales started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council.
During the trial until December, wagon cars with daily necessities, seasonings, and food went through the Suso Town Council and the Hanpo Town Council on the first day.
Some of the products that were sold more than expected were quickly replenished, and the residents asked them to continue saying, "I'm happy to pick goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, designated garbage bags and detergents.
The total vegetables, such as potato salads, which are divided into packs, are lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Susomachi-kai, people's columns were built, and salt and sugar were sold out.
"I didn't think it would sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping for his husband, expressed his expectation that "the price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope he will continue."
Users also received orders such as "I want a cup of coffee that is not a can coffee, but a cup of coffee that is dripped by myself."
The Council considers the products that were requested.
On Noto Island, there are only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell the goods to save "shopping weak."
By December, the 20-machi-kai in the island will be around once a month and will be considered to be able to continue as a business after the next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that it had decided to add about $100 million to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances are greatly reviewed for simplicity.
In addition, approximately $34,000 million will be recorded as a drought-affected resident support organization, and the target farmers will receive an emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities are assisted by a drought relief fund with a maximum of $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion budgets for drought support.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Hasskel (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014, killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of his five children.
According to the authorities, on July 9, 2014, Haskel was pushed into the house of Stay and asked where his wife Melanie Haskel was staying.
Melanie was absent, but his sister, Katie Stay and his family were there.
Haskell fired and reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13-year-old and four-year-old son, nine-year-old and seven-year-old daughter, died.
In his family, only one person, Cashy Stay, who was 15 years old at the time, died.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but then recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed allegations against the loss of the heart of Ronald Lee Haskel.
The jury was dismissed from the commission until Monday.
"If you choose to disappoint us, never forgive us."
Is the appeal of a girl who shook her voice with anger resonated with each other's leaders?
Global warming is becoming more severe.
At the UN Climate Action Summit held in New York City, Swedish 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
For example, boycotting classes and sitting in front of the parliament, the school strike became a spark to spread throughout the world.
The young people, who were anxious and anxious, protested all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people from over 150 countries participated.
Morioka also set up a message board and marched.
The threat of climate change is approaching close.
The Paris Agreement, which will be launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century, and reduce the temperature rise to less than twice before the Industrial Revolution.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed countries and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to the relationship with global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is followed by various regions.
In order to increase global warming at a fast pace, one-step efforts are required.
At the summit, which was realized by the call of Secretary General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to make real zero by 50.
Other 70 countries raised their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which had announced the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not explicitly express their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers became apparent.
It is also strongly criticized for Japan's strong coal-fired power generation.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at the environmental-related meeting, told him that he should work on fun, cool and sexy issues at the meeting.
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no resistance to Greta, who is now a symbol of environmental movement.
The injury, which cannot be discussed, will not be included in the "replacement of issues" that the person counters.
There is no longer a grace to combat global warming, and the international community must respond to the common crisis of mankind in a timely manner.
There is no sufficient effectiveness for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act to avoid taking the future.
one step forward to quantum internet realization
The results of the U.S. Army's research led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to secure military safety, measure and measure time functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Distributed Quantum Information Center of the Army Research Institute of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, which is funded by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 kilometers using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in the entangle state and the measurement is performed on one side, even if the other quantum bits are physically distant, the measurement results are affected by the other.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a real distance to start building a intercity quantum network," says Dr. Ben Lañon, experimental physicist at Insbruck University, who is the leading researcher of the project, who announced the results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network is composed of a network of physical quantum bits in the entangle state despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale decentralized engagement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum network use.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and then excited them until quantum information was released.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangles.
The challenge is to transmit the photon with a fiber optic cable.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Dr. Lañon.
The team then sent the light particles through a non-linear crystal with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, which is the optimal value for long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
This photon was then sent through a fiber optic cable of 50 kilometers long.
In the measurement results, atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance migration of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of entangled networks in long-range atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army from the perspective of accurate positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications."
