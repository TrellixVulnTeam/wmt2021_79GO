PayPay salesman "I'll ride the waves" "Cashless to wake up" I wonder if the waves will swell (Thai TV) - Yahoo! News
The tax hike started in October.
In line with this, the country will start the cashless point reduction project.
Reducing up to 5% to reduce the coldness of consumption is "cashless."
[Looking at the picture] just before the tax increase... store and business operators introduced cashless.
So what's happening now is "introduction."
It is a cashless shop that has been a cash business.
It was closely linked to the installation site.
"Cashless" was introduced just before the tax hike.
"Okiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular shop operated by Takeshin Seika, and there are more than 100 kinds of sweets in the shop.
On this day, Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users.
PayPay Yasuda: Is there any payment method other than cash?
Mr. Shinmi: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it's easier than cash if you get used to it, because it's not possible to receive Tsurisen.
Up to now, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce 20% of usage by points.
Anta has been increasing the number of users explosively, but Yasuda is a salesman that sells the user's use, that is, PayPay's introduction to the store.
"Okiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also listened to Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's a peak now, and if you're not able to talk about it before you jump, or if you're going to do a consumer return business together, you'll be able to listen to it at PayPay, and now you're riding a wave."
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the country's consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves, but the country's consumer return business.
In October, the country introduced a system to reduce the consumption tax by 5% to consumers in order to prevent the cooling of consumption.
There are few small retail stores that consider it to introduce cashless payments before tax hikes.

What is the Münchhausen syndrome that appeared in The Politician of Netflix?
The symptoms suggest that parents and parents are sick.
The Polytchan is broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is the story of Patton Hobart, who aims to become president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council of his high school.
It was produced by American Horror Story and Gree producer Ryan Murphy, and featured by Gwinness Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that allows parents to behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, despite the fact that humans under their protection are not seriously ill.
There are various types of pathology, but it is also included in the Münchhausen syndrome, which is hypothesized to be sick of himself.
However, the representative Münchhausen syndrome clearly implies that others under their protection are ill.
This is also known as FII, counterfeiting or induced disease, and is a type of child abuse.
Although it is unusual, parents usually exaggerated symptoms or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what is the sign of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS is listed as a precaution.
The child is healthy, but if the condition is poor, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
I'll explain to you, or complain about false symptoms.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing diabetes.
Overdose drugs and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How general is Muunchhausen syndrome?
Many cases have not been reported, so it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000, estimated that 89 cases of 100,000 people had occurred over two years.
what should we do if we suspect a child's damage?
Contact local social welfare agencies or call NSPCC Children's Protection Helpline 0808 800 5000.

Kaduna - The State Police conducted an investigation yesterday at Imam Ahmed Bun Hanbal School in Rain Maidhuven Tumma, Igabi jurisdiction, arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
The police said that the children were placed in an inhumane environment, but the school denied the claim.

"Before entering a child, parents signed their consent.
The parents came to deliver their meals every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were doing.
It was very surprised that the police came and evacuated the children, and all the food that parents delivered left, and that the school closed.
There are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair treatment."
He added that the former police chief Abdullahman had visited once to see what kind of environment the kids were doing, but there was nothing to complain about.
The children also learned Corlan and said that it was all.
However, police spokesman Yakb Savo said that children would be reunited after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of getting knowledge about Corlan, they were placed in an inhumane environment.
Many children were injured on their back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage gilly suit with leaves caught a 12-year-old girl from behind in a school at Central Coast in the state.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to wood and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized numerous items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges, including this assault and another 11-year-old girl grooming and sexual abuse.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on the road and witnessed a man armed with a large tree branches and knife suddenly coming out of the bushes.
When the girl asked him, "Don't stop, stop it."
The man said to the girl, "I don't speak loud.
When I hear it, I can't see it."
The man had a knife on his right hand and the girl's hands tied in a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused for nearly an hour.
When a man broke the cable, the girl ran into a school crying like crazy.
The man had several phone emails and telephones from his colleagues at work, but he did not respond and arrived at work around 9:30 a.m.
The man stood out in the clothes of mud, grass, and trees, and claimed that he had been involved in street violence, and that he had been chasing the driver down to the bush.
The men's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development is based on public interests and warns IT representatives.
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats and investors that if there was no ethical assessment of public interests, artificial intelligence development competition and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met.
At the conference titled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and dangers in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions on the future of war technology development and increasing machine work were held, and there were also cases of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and social media companies responding to the atrocities.
In his speech at the conference, Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines were freed from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If the advancement of technology causes increasingly noticeable inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advancements are hostile to public interests, then unfortunately, we're going to go back to some kind of barbarism based on the theory of the bull.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to use the expertise of the participants in this conference to find the talent that can become a future advisor to the Catholic Church in high-tech fields.

Martin Woodegoll performed a surprise support for Michel Oyalusabal.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, renewing the undefeated record in the current domestic season, making it the top spot in La Liga.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, Zinedine Zidane was exposed to tremendous pressure, such as a fierce open battle and a public discontent with Welsh star Gareth Bail.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, the pressure seemed to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Jimine Zidan and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.

With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third penalty spot of the stunning Oyalusabar, he secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before Alabeth's midfiller and Manuel Garcia left for 5 minutes before the end.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally achieved this territory.
She was surprised by the name of Sharad Powerle at Anna Hazale and Maharashtra bank fraud loans.
Anna Hazale said, "When we contacted this lawsuit, the name of Sharad Power was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra Co-operative Bank fraud incident involving thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Bureau (ED) filed a fund-cleaning lawsuit against Sharad Powerll and his nephew, Deputy Minister of State Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Act on Preventing Money laundering, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, accused of the name of the former chairman of the bank, Amit Powerle and the former staff of the union bank of 70 members.
When he came to contact the lawsuit, his name was nowhere.
Anna Hazale asked the executive officer's lawsuits and suspicions that Sharad Powerll was involved in the fraud case, and stated on Thursday that "only they know how Sharad's name emerged or who mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Power, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud case, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerle denied any misconduct and claimed that it had no relationship with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of a lawsuit registration just weeks before the Maharashtra parliamentary election on October 21.
The former U.S. Minister clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, stating that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
The NCP referred to the action by the Executive Bureau as a formality.

Stop the accident with the accelerator pedal!
Four quick-moving devices that can be reared - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
Traffic accidents caused by driving mistakes.
In particular, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator steps by elderly drivers is increasing.
In particular, when you start suddenly, you will be panicked, and the accelerator will remain on the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with a safety driver support function that can cover such driving errors, but there is also a rearing device that can be mounted on unmounted vehicles.
After-sale parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapids and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARRM] The "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pibott to inform you of pedal steps from a new perspective.
The pedal's step mistake is to avoid using an alarm sound.
The mechanism occurs when the brake is wrong and the accelerator pedal is required or higher when it is stopped or running low speed.
It helps to react to the sound and return the accelerator to avoid rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the step mistake.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the step mistake of the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf to hear.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with two-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (tax excluded) and it is easy to set up.
The world wing was launched in mid-September to prevent accelerator and brake step errors.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without advance.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped, the vehicle's vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, electrically suppresses the accelerator opening and suppresses the rapid advance.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator and instantly control the rush by turning it into a creep running state (where the brakes are separated by the D range).
At the back of the vehicle, it also detects the speed of about 5Km/h or more, and has the ability to force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The mounting is only possible with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Ms. Suosato KUSUNOMOTO (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that the three-year-old child who liked the nursery school suddenly disappeared after the water damage and was forced to go to the nursery school at night.
Recalling that adults were busy cleaning up their homes and had no time to face enough," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can not panic and say "I'm okay."
Yukari Otsukashi (36) in Shiraishi-cho spent a night in a shelter town office with four families, including three-year-old children.
"If you have a child who can't stay still, you can use your mind around it."
The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children from 4 to 12 years old, was soaked in water around the house.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much as possible at home as possible during a disaster, with food and simple toilets.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in family configuration and home situation."
Shinko Kawasaki (40) in Shiraishi-cho, with a child of 6 years and 8 years old, proposed that elementary school had an e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or mail system.
There was also a request to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed since before, and I don't know "It was okay last time."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
Tanaka said, "The opinions that were issued are thought to convey to the administration as a group."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Urcuri is a reference to the police agency.
The Police Agency (IOPC) will examine whether the scandal in London mayor's office should be investigated as a violation of criminal law.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts on acts" on suspicion that Archery had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"There is information that indicates that crime could have been done," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this issue.
The issue was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC was an agency that responded to accusations issued by police in England and Wales.
The issue was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the police chief at that time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship with Arcuri.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information about his relationship with Urcuri.
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported that the Americans who moved to London seven years ago were paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the London Mayor's era, and that Johnson and other foreign trade-related dispatchers three times.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to the hacker house, the company of Mr. Curi during the investigation.
The company will ask questions about the investigation process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Digital Department has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns the British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arcuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among employees."
The movement of the GLA trying to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
The government officials said that this was a "politically motivated attack," and that the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too party-oriented."
"In any case, the supervisory authority did not submit evidence, and the prime minister was not given an opportunity to answer the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late Friday night."
The people and the mass media will be able to see the political Kyogen that was carefully organized.
As I mentioned earlier, Standard Newspaper heard that Johnson, who supported the London Tourism Promotion Division, and his friends with California businessmen were "public secrets."
The former staff of the London and Partners (L&P) said that despite some people who believed that the company was "untrustful" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany the foreign trade-related talks led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Yawakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard about the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Iwakami Sunobu.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what are you feeling now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all those involved, not just the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of supporting the formation of property for general consumers.
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursued for 20 years.
When the general public eliminates the anxiety of money, the world will be bright from the foundation.
In the long term, operation will not be performed unless you walk with beneficiaries.
Many money comes from the "Sawakami Fund" when the market plunges like the Lehman shock and the IT bubble burst.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have been talking about since the time of our day.
This is the reason why it became a long-term fund for 20 years, and I believe it is because it continued to be a direct sales system to deliver messages directly to many people.
At the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just conveying the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box, but all the "Sawakami Fund" has been disclosed.
This is why we can trust you.
m. miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested for drug offenses associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the trial record, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit pills of oxycodon mixed with Fentanil before Miller accidentally took over cocaine, alcohol and Fentanil, but Fentanil was a powerful opioid drug that was plagued by thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Pett, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Pettyt had obtained drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Libis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, was accused of delivering drugs to Petty as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still an anti-verbal about individual cases.
Walter, currently in detention, was under probation for drug offenses in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The prosecutors in charge of the case, first reported by the celebrity site TMZ on Thursday, requested that Walter be detained until the trial start due to the high possibility of escape from abroad.
There was no immediate response to the phone call message to the lawyer.
Pettyt was prosecuted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defenders refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics include a frank word about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as a member of the Grand Palace in hip hop.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, but was defeated in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram, and released a song titled "Sancue Neckst."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died of opioid drug abuse in recent years.
The rock band Three Doors Down guitarist Matthew Roberts died of overdose of drugs in 2016 and found Fentanil and Hydrocodon in the body.
This article corrected Walter's spelling of the name Stephen instead of Steven.
More than 30 mobile games developed in Nigeria
This 9-year-old boy uses a free programming app called scratch2 to create a game of ghosts.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, animations and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats from the hiding place.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that he spends time making games when bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day short-term intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course hosted by Code Fest International was introduced to give children a chance to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in many mobile games.
"Since Basil always had a mobile phone and had a game, he bought a tablet at the age of four.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did pretty well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, Basil became interested in making games.
"One day I was doing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," he said.
He said, "I'm always playing games, but how about making games myself so that others can play?
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basil has been interested in learning how to make his own games and asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to be a scientist in the future, has a name in his game.
One of the games, "Moskite mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is made, young people such as Basil have the leadership.
Two of Nigeria's twelve-year-olds have recently been recognized to create robots that use program code to separate housework.
In May 2019, a women's high school team from Ghana, who programming boxed robots, won the Robot Fest Contest.
African investment in Google and Microsoft giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil-chan and the children of the same age will become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, a false testimony for bribery investigation
According to a court document submitted on Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to falsely testify to federal agents who conducted corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the list of federal court cases, Robin Hayes is convicted on Wednesday next week.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes, Hayes was aware of false statements by FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the documents based on the facts do not specify which sin Haze recognizes.
Hayes was initially accused of conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor accused Hayes of being involved in a plan for the insurance company's heavy duty to fund the state's insurance director's election.
Two co-owners, Greg Lindbergh, were accused of attempted bribes to Secretary of State Mike Cozy.
Lindberg, founder of insurance and investment companies, has donated more than $500 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported Republican principles and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer asked him to comment on Friday and email, but he did not answer.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the defendant's lawyer, requested an additional comment by email, but did not reply.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes did not speak with Corsey about the State Insurance Bureau staff.
However, according to the fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about requests for personnel transfer from the State Insurance Director and the Insurance Bureau from Lindberg.
The prosecutors said he helped Lindberg's request that Hayes would like to meet with Corsey, and spoke directly with the director.
The prosecution announced in April claimed that Lindberg had sought special treatment for his own insurance business and was planning to raise $200 million to campaign for Cozy's 2020 re-election.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy was involved in a request for replacement of officials who had reviewed the company in Lindberg.
Republican Corsey reported alleged attempted bribes to federal agents and helped them.
There is no doubt about Cozy.
Indictment is described in a conversation involving Lindberg and Cozy that Lindberg's co-owners instructed Hayes to send $25 million to Cozy's re-election campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would pay attention if he could move a lot of money, but eventually broke out in the conversation.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do anything you want."
i know, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutors Office requested an e-mail address for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like other people's posts!
This change followed the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July.
This new Facebook attempt will start on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager Mia Garrick said that this change was based on feedback from mental health experts that would cause happiness surveys and goodies!
Garlic said, "There was a very positive feedback from many bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
Users only delete numbers so that they can focus on the quality and content of exchange, rather than the number of actions they like!
Garlic said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick said that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test is conducted as early as the test.
Instagram, under Facebook, does not announce when the test ends or changes.
"We initially had positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now we're listening to feedback and learning," Garrick said.
Garrick, who is in Australia in the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very aggressive Facebook and Instagram user.
He thought Australia was a great country to get really good feedback on whether this was a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my favorite bag, and I couldn't move somewhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was a part of Cando's handicrafts that helped me.
when i gave up
My mother's broken bag, my chin is the ultimate pchipra.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main body was significantly exceeded.
My mother unfortunately said, "Don't throw away ...," but I didn't want to give up.
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for the replacement of this connected fitting.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
It will be 100 percent as expected.
It is originally used for key holders and Charm DIY.
It was planned to be used one by one at the end of the bag handle and bought two pieces.
Although the size of the ring is small, it is made exactly the same as the bag fittings on one side left.
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is attached tightly.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
The color of the gold fitting feels good♪ However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor ...
So I decided to make the ring a couple of times.
The number of metal fittings increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight is not quite a problem.
Rather, I feel that the number of cracked parts increased and the design level was improved.
The express "Aso" of the JNR is a temporary train, Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train designed by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 train fans boarded 12 blue coaches from Hiroshima Station and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and Japanese travel was organized as part of the "Kumamoto Destiny Campaign" by JR companies.
The train consists of seven cars, including a passenger train and a locomotive.
A special headmark was drawn by Mt. Aso.
his brother's life imprisonment with the honor murder of a social media star in pakistan.
Candy Barochi, who gained fame in a photo posted on social media, was hanged in July 2016.
His older brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment with an honor murder, which was the most popular in Pakistan.
Undoubted selfie photo - Although it is not large in Western standards, Barochi, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, which is very strong for female derogacy - was hanged in July 2016.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
In a press conference a few days later, his brother said that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Saldar Memoud, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
He said, "Insharah (God's thought) would be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that his son wanted to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Baroch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of lightening the rules of his father's right-of-law society, the voices of victims and most women seeking action against the spread of so-called "principal murders."
Women chose their own marriage partner, and in the case of Mr. Barochi, they burned down in crimes such as praise of their sexuality and shamed their family, killing, killing, stabbed or strangled.
The murder is usually carried out by relatives.
Later, in Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) law, the perpetrators can be pardoned from the relatives of the victim.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill that required life imprisonment for honorable murder.
However, whether the murder is an honorable crime is held at the discretion of the judge, the killer can claim another motive in theory and may be pardoned.
In the case of Mr. Baroch, his parents initially insisted not give him a pardon.
However, the parents who were sad about losing their son changed their thoughts and said they wanted to forgive their son.
In response to international hatred for murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented measures to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket Team and wearing a straight red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although it became critical and threatened, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that it opened the new heavens and earth in a country where it was considered a political activity to enhance the status of women boldly and to express itself as a presence like Kim Kardashian.
The roots of "respectful" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, especially in women's behavior, although men may be victims.

In addition to actively cooperating in projects conducted by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
When both organizations conduct training related to sports, they mediate and dispatch specialized trainers and instructors, and share information.
When a team of remote islands travel outside the island, they will work to solve problems such as the trainers are not oblivious in terms of travel costs.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in conjunction with the prefectural competitions and other events on the mainland, we will support the reduction of the performance of the athletes due to fatigue during boat trips and night stay.
In addition, when the tournament is held on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players from outside the island by cooperating with local recoil clinics and hospitals.

Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice about "mote."
The brain science theory is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the previous edition (see related article), Moteko is hard to stick to the traditional "male fantasy" and the pattern learning to make it is overwhelming!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and mote man.
if you are bound by what you should do
In the first part, since "coolness" is constantly evolving, I talked about various works, people's behavior, and learning patterns every day.
When learning patterns, I think that the brain will be able to systematically organize actions in this case.
I think it's still evolving every day, apart from whether it's "mote."
That's why I can live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you're stuck in the old pattern that says, "The teacher at university is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say, "What should I do?" or "What should I do?"
Because people and society change even if they don't change.
I talked about that in my recent talk book, "No matter how terrible it is in the world."
"It's heavy" and "authority" are things that naturally come out by admitting that person around.
I don't think he's not easy.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
I don't know how to do it at Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, it can't be light if you're stuck in the sense.
As long as I heard a lot of women, regardless of their position or age, it seems to be a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to say that this is cute.

In the northwest of Nigeria, the illegal state doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled by about 40,000 due to the intensifying violence over the last four months.
According to the UN Refugees Agency, a new humanitarian crisis was created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, each institution cooperated to fund $35.5 million.
The UNHCR spokesman Barbar Barrok said that the Islamic extremist organization Bokohalam, which has been active in anti-government in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina in Nigeria over the last ten months was organized by armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok told reporters on Friday.
Abducts, tortures, assaults, murders and sexual violence are frequently occurring, and the attackers are also working for theft and destruction of homes.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoham and the West African branch of the Islamic State, which was split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," he says.
What they carry is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that, in particular, the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the coming months.
The new trial date for men killed two women and two children was confirmed.

According to the police, on 16 July, he was shot dead by Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and son (5).
In court records, a new date of trial will be determined on January 27, giving the time to prepare both plaintiffs and defendants.
According to officials of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Bureau, Escoral Orillana was illegally staying in the United States and was forced back twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.

In order to respond to requests from advertisers in recent years, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year to directly purchase advertising frameworks in conjunction with media companies.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header binding allows them to participate in bids directly to the header binding target advertising framework, which is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, due to limited media coverage, the advertising framework for distributions along with individual commercial materials and brand images is secured, preventing brand value damage.
One of the advantages of media companies is that it is possible to work closely with the hope of introducing media companies through a solution that manages the code of bidder companies called " wrapper solutions" that LFP promotes collaboration.
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, Jettro Support for Overseas Shoe | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Trade Promotion Agency (Jetro) is working to support the expansion of sales channels for small and medium-sized enterprises through the Internet page overseas.
It is an attempt to set up a special corner in Japan on the overseas site to introduce local products together and sell them directly to overseas consumers.
The company's application has exceeded 1,000 companies, and has been successful in China and Southeast Asia.
"JAPAN MALL Project" started last year.
The main target of small and medium-sized enterprises with no overseas sales channels is to promote the global expansion of cosmetics, beverages and processed products.
It is possible to sell at 24 major sites including Europe, the Middle East, and Asia in cooperation with Jettro.
Two months of suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata at Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that he had suspended an assistant professor at the Yonezawa Campus for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the General Affairs Department, in October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, Assistant Professors of the Department of General Affairs repeated oppressive behavior, such as being emotionally emotional and abused in inappropriate words.
He was a teacher of education and was certified to deteriorate the learning environment.
A survey conducted in September 18 reported several students.
In December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and in December of the same year, they conducted a survey of harassment prevention measures committees by teachers at Yonezawa Campus.
In response to the findings from the committee, President Kiyohito Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
Even after the survey, Assistant Professors continued to teach, but during the interview, the previous act was improved, and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Oyama said, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to take all of my studies to prevent harassment and try to recover confidence."
The university also conducts internal surveys on the alleged sexual harassment of female students led by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts The San Paper Requests Boris Johnson to reduce EU withdrawal requests and make compromises with the EU.
Now, just three weeks after the EU summit, which will be a settlement, there is a growing concern around the prime minister that the prime minister might be out of time to withdraw substantial concessions.
Boris Johnson faces a cabinet rebellion that seeks to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and compromise with the EU.
The negotiations over a new tariff system, which replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border, are packed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative to "improvement."
The Senior Ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by the German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose a compromise proposal in the ground, including a three-year time limit on backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the Conservatives' annual meeting in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the "strong" strategy that threatens the EU, which was devised by the Advanced Advisor Dominique Camings, without agreement, and insists that the EU will accept the offer that the EU will be out of limit time.
One cabinet member said that the ruling that the Supreme Court had illegally closed the assembly on Tuesday would be "the alarm," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his step.
It is not effective even if it is radical, and the Camation's plan is obviously unsuccessful.
It is impossible to fight in many areas.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Mr. Johnson to run an agreement with Prime Minister Terryza May.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are a number of reasons for this, and everyone is trying to end this.
If we can't postpone, Boris will end, and we will all end.
Lord John Mayer denounced Boris not seriously considering negotiations.
The leader of the Conservative Party said in a harsh speech: "The prime minister wants to make an agreement with the EU.
However, we do not see the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Ures, and discussing with the people in the streets.
The prime minister's press yesterday admitted that the agreement was still a long time ahead, saying, "If anyone does not think of it, the way is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month re postponement, would significantly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue their progress despite the enactment of the bill."
Stephen Barclay, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, returned to Brussels today to further discuss with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how the regulation of all Irish islands on food and livestock works.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never be a success in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, revealed that he was told by the TV station boss that he would "not succeed."
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, 59 years old, said he was very nervous.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I worked as a surveyor at the BBC Scotland branch and told my boss that your Glasgow accent would not succeed in the absolute television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, he went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Ann Diamond and Mike Morris interviewed the legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe he was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a TV-am Scottish correspondent in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast, and Daybreak, and later began a program named after her.
In commemoration of his 35th anniversary, he broadcast a special program to reflect Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
He added that passion and enthusiasm and curiosity were the key to survival in the television industry, and that the host said, "You have to put it into work."
It must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that it was "very painful" to interview Danbourne shooting.
The next day of the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think we were watching many of the families of the children who were killed or injured, broadcast live shows from Dunblane.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna's daughter, personally wants to see me, so we talked for hours at her house.
Not all that covered on the show, I went to Joanna funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McKan's daughter Madrelain were missing, saying that it was "very painful" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets that do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine was broadcast on ITV from 8:30 am on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga, fearing traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantine Chiwenga declined the offer of President Robert Mugabe, who was in the midst of a political change, due to fears that it might be a trap that would lead to military action in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the Defense Forces continued, and Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give him the presidency, and the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week.
However, Tiwenga refused the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of the regime in a coup, rather than anxiety.
According to Jamwanda2's Twitter account, which confirms that officials are senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has held the administration for 37 years, is willing to give the administration to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munangagwa," it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
Mugabe, who realized he was losing power, told the government officials that he had made contact with Chiwenga by envoys.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three.
George Charanba, president of Spokesman, and his high-ranking officials reported that Arron Nepera, the top representative of the Central Intelligence Organization at the time, and Fidelis Mukonoli, Roman Catholic bishop, were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, former president of the Zimbabwe Preparatory Bank, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Chiwenga.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, attempted to condemn the African Union's actions while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to give the presidency to former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of former presidents.
"Some of the family members of the late president began to fatigue, and it was a wasteful act to save the rapidly expanding situation as dangerous as possible," he wrote.
However, at least diplomatically, the political aim of the late president was a little.
If we could destroy the constitutional order, we would have been to clash with the views of the African Union on the coup, but we would remind you that the commanders were not breaking the constitutional order and that they were not going to break.
The late President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top military officer of the time, would trap and destroy the claims of the commanders claiming that the constitutional order was not broken.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, could decide whether to position it as a coup, would eventually be considered a valid military intervention request, even though it was called a coup.
That was the intention and calculation underlying this offer.
When the defense forces realized they were not protected, Mugabe was moving, and officials said.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe would have to write his resignation.
The commanders of the army told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the president's house called Blueloo, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family and prove his power deprivation by the military.
The commanders and commanders at that time read the intent accurately.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa" (which we belong to the Kamowaju group, the military department), were used to describe a powerful metaphorical expression that "if we are not politicians, there is no political competition."
The Army told the local commanders that through the military officers who stayed in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at that time, South Africans, who were key to this process, refused to intervene, but were repeatedly threatened behind it, revealing that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military invaded the office.
"It wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, so it wasn't possible to achieve it," he said.
The ratification of the treaty in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
[New York Joint] On 26th at the UN Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and Mr. Takeuchi (63), the granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, spoke to support the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
The new five countries ratified the Treaty of Prohibition and ratified it into 32 countries and regions.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
The meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons.
Secretary-General Guterres also spoke of strong concerns in recent years that there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is no other way to eliminate it."
China needs strong leadership, and if it doesn't matter, the collapse of policy documents
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In the White Paper, the Chinese State Council said that the success of the Communist Party 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified, powerful leadership, China will lead to division and collapse, and will be disastrous for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing issues in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratization movement in Beijing, as needed for national stability.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held the government in late 2012, further strengthened the control of the party and tightened the resistance to the party.
He also oversaw the modernization program of the military that threatened the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export the development model of its own country, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but rather just seek peace.
Some Chinese genes do not invade or control other people.
In modern times, China was bullied from the bullies, and war and confusion left a deep scar with its pain; China would never take the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as sluggish economic conditions and anti-government movements in Hong Kong, China, which are difficult to cope with during the harsh trade war with the United States.
China will never "delete" its core interests and will not allow the loss of security and sovereignty.
"The tariffs that continue to rise with the threat of trade war are no problem-solving," says White Paper in relation to trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with a complete industrial system, full industrial chain, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"It never weakens in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities and opening a new world.
China has no idea of competing against the United States, and I don't want to replace it with the United States, so the United States should calmly grasp the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely to stop China's development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move its domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director of Kaneko.
Yokohama Taka, a high school baseball master who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced on August 28, that he was dismissed by Toru Hirata (36) and Masashi Kaneko (42).
In the future, he will act as a coach and the director (responsible teacher) will promptly decide.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that local newspapers had a rumor about baseball players.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's neck, and Kimko admitted some of the rumors.
In addition, in light of the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two again confirmed the facts, and the fact was generally accepted as facts.
In the summer of 1515, Motochizen Watanabe (74), who was raised by Daisuke MATSUSAKA (present-day Nakanichi) and others, left the city.
He served as Director of the Board of Directors and Director of the Board of Directors.
He participated in the Kokoen Garden in the summer of 16 years and also participated in the Spring Senbatsu.
However, after losing to Sagamihara in the semi-finals in the summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semi-finals in autumn and was desperate for the next spring.
The Spice Girls' MelC and Severage Severage Diseases banned diet topics in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melannie Chizom, who had been unable to eat anything other than fruit and vegetables for many years, admitted that diet was banned at home.
The sporty spices have long been "excessive exercise" without eating enough under pressure from members of the global pop group.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by the child rearing of his daughter Scarlett, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old, and I'm getting distracted by my own appearance."
However, because I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's customs.
Having gained fame as a member of Spice Girls in the 1990s, Mer told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that, in the early 1990s, a "bad" comment on himself in the media led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I was able to remove certain food groups, get more and more exercised and get too thin," Mel.
I was sick, and that condition lasted almost a few years."
The same-sex marriage justice judgment: The Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch judged that this was a case where "in fact marriage" according to marriage was contested whether or not it was established in the same sex.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, and there is no legal effect in Japan.
Based on this, the decision was approved by two women.
It is considered the first judicial decision to recognize legal protection by the same-sex couples.
In the case that the same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Register Act, a lawsuit seeking compensation for damages to the country is conducted in five districts including Sapporo.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights protection of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system to recognize the diverse families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The decision was certified as "the reality that is different from the fact of marriage between men and women" due to the achievements of the two living together.
It is a revolutionary decision to extend the recognition of marriage with the right to marry in social insurance and other social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution to "free marriage" as the marriage is "only based on the mutual agreement."
It is said that both sexes were not considered same-sex marriages at the time of the establishment, but were not resolved to deny same-sex marriage.
"The Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," but it is expected that it will be a driving force for the same-sex marriage lawsuits in various places.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, the problem remained, as "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women."
While recognizing the actual situation equivalent to men and women, it may be difficult to distinguish the right to protect.
According to the National Family Trend Survey conducted by married women, about 70% of people were required to recognize same-sex marriage by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, the law is bound by traditional family statues to take away the rights of people who cannot afford it.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" who admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from various viewpoints, such as not only marriage between the same sexes but also the expansion of legal rights for marriage in fact.
to the trial and jury trial of former athletes prosecuted for rape against multiple women.
A jury trial was held for former Delaware University baseball players who were prosecuted for sexual assault.
Friday, after ten days of testimony and speech, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
A 21-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted after she sent her to her home by car.
After three weeks of meeting at Banbble, Konaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Conaway was accused of sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women's paradoxical claims and memory differences would have regretted having physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure and said, "The next season is the Penang Detachment." - Yahoo! News
In the third round, Hiroshima was defeated in the final round of the season, and the possibility of his own entry into the CS failed.
If the player wins the remaining three games, they will be replaced.
At the ceremony after the match, Director Takao Ogata (50) said, "I'm sorry that I didn't win the final match and I couldn't determine the rankings.
He was attracted by some fans.
In addition, at the end of his remarks, he said, "I will do my best to steal Penangt next season."
However, after the end of the ceremony, he was asked by the press for the matter, saying, "I'm not finished yet, so I'm not going to finish everything."
[Dospo] Ota is No. 4 after his transfer and No. 20 is his most self-responsibility.
He became a "returner" to seniors.
He took the lead four times, and on the left side, he made his 20th home run at the liner.
I reached the number of home runs that I had targeted, "I stopped receiving this number and tried to do it with trial and error."
His intention was also firm.
It was the first four-seater to join.
He said, "I put it in the fourth place to shake it off."
Oda responded to his expectations, saying, "I felt so excited about it and entered the game, and I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal four statues is the giant Abe who retired from active service this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads to victory, and the 4th is the team's 4th, and the 4th seniors who have seen the giant were the same."
Among them, "The appearance of Mr. Abe is the most thought, and it was a reliable existence, and I looked at that back and became my style."
List of new sports on September 27
it's a serious pollution of popular tourist attractions, videos, obviously
Sydney Harbour is one of Sydney's tourism resources that brings $209 million to the Australian economy every year.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways with about 15 cups of contaminants each year in the Olympic pool.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities often flow into Sydney Harbour due to heavy rainwaters flowing through the road, including sucking shells, plastic bags, plastic bottles, shoes, clothes and even animal corpses.
Among them, plastics are the most important factors to block waterways.
Dr. Catherine Duffon, vice president of Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of Japan's coastlines that has been significantly altered and polluted.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but after that, Sydney Harbour was pretty tragic."
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what the truth is there," said David Center Manley, owner Richard Nichols, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is under the water surface), I think everyone will really do it.
It's overwhelming, but more than half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The remaining half is used in plastics at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone can see that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing down the water immediately.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of Ocean Protection, said that local residents may also be able to reduce plastic and waste flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source of development.
It reduces the use of plastics, recycles more well, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we suck comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
However, we repair Sydney Harbour and return it to our old appearance, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing people.
A new study on plastic and mental health was also announced this month, as part of an effort to encourage Australian citizens to know more about environmental protection and the reduction of the effects of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of the 546 children between 12 and 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
In this study, both parents and parents ranked fourth in concerns about plastic waste, and 93 percent of respondents surveyed said they were increasingly concerned about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
Former Karatsu Power Station in October | Administration and Society of Saga News | Saga Shimbun
The construction of the former Karatsu power plant started in October, and the chimney of the former Karatsu power plant started.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) located in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
It was used to emit gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
The chimney is split from top to bottom with a tower crane.
The plan requires nine months of decomposition and 18 months.
The remaining turbines and boilers were not destroyed.
There is a regrettable voice, and a man in his 60s who runs a restaurant nearby said, "When you look at a chimney back from afar, it is like a symbol that made you feel back to Karatsu."
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and second in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port, and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because it is near Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine, agreed to use the site in 15 years.

He negotiated with tourist facilities in the city to sell goods.

This time, Mama Takahashi, a freelance announcer and a monthly commentator on CBC TV, said about his master.
the advice of the master who saved me who was rotten
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a teacher beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I don't know what I'm doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important as a working person.
I finally became an announcer of the TV station by 120% of my efforts, but when I was told to be "conne" or "busyk," my father said, "If I thought it was "conne," and Mama was said to be in power.
After that, when I joined the company in the second and third year, I was only working "Anyone with an empty woman is good," and when I wasn't motivated by what I wanted to do, I didn't get motivated, and my heart was rotten.
i learned naturally from my father's performance.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but in fact, since I joined the TV station, I've been in touch with the news all the time with the narration of BS and news shows.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe praised me as "very good to read Mama news."
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sensed.
It has been cultivated by watching his father's stage, film, television, and historical drama in his childhood.
In other words, I think my father's thanks to the various experiences of my childhood.
Midori's 300-year history/education promotion project | Miyako Daily Newspaper Website - The latest news of Miyakojima is packed!
Workshops in Kagamihara
Workshop on the role and effect of five musical instruments played by dancing was introduced on the 26th.
The group dance workshop (hosted by the Prefectural Board of Education and Education Agency) was held on 26th at Kagamihara Junior High School.

The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is WRC revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship are held.
Since 1973, it has been held every year to become the world's highest rallying championship with history and tradition, and it is said that the competition will be the most demanding car competition to run fast on various road surfaces such as gravel roads and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title from 1999 and became a big topic.
This time, the Japan Round Invitational Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with stakeholders to achieve the success of the Fall 2020 Games so that we can make a big appeal to the world as the center of motorsports in Japan.

is it the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could bring great reforms to patient care.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells were camouflaged.
Researchers found the same process in Tasmanian devils and humans.
This discovery is expected to create a new method for treating cancer patients.
What are the similarities between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
The researchers, including researchers at the Peter McClell Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to working on a deadly face tumor that threatens the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
This study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camflage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating small cell lung cancers, neuroblastomas, and skin cancers called Merkel cells.
Prof. Mark Dowson, a researcher at Peter McCallum, said, "The very important thing in this project is that for patients who have been resistant to immunotherapy, we may be able to reverse that process."
Reuse traditional therapies, revitalizing markers, i.e. proteins known as MHC, may enable the immune system to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a considerable impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Doson said.
"The lung cancer is an epidemic in the world.
And treatment may be much better.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat the face-to-face tumors of Tasmanian devils, where cancer cells escape detection.
"Unfortunately, the same process occurs at all (in humans and Tasmanian devil cancers).
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if drugs that are effective for humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may be useful to control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting polar stars.
Scientists have discovered the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, which orbits a giant Jupiter-type planet around a small star called red dwarf, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b around the red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the size of stars and planets is not large, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% larger than the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"Yes, that's another surprise," said Juan Carlos Morales, an astronomical physicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, who led this research published in Science.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, and only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, the surface temperature is much lower than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I'm doing a red color."
While the second planet orbits the star, Morales stated that the third planet could have been released from its star system in the past, explaining the elliptic orbit of its Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gases and dust that generate stars orbiting themselves.
The most powerful planetary formation model, known as the "core integrated" model, generates objects from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes atmosphere by pulling the eggs of the planet.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature was lower."
Since the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses may grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a medip containing stimulants, ate to his colleagues and prosecuted.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernandes (38) was accused of eating dipping beans with awakening agents to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Animina Hernández (38) was accused of subtracting methane fetamin and taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to the estimates of the oaths obtained from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Merion County Sheriff to give a little taste to see Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach deteriorated and her legs fell.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have had methane fetamin in soy dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández had told the victim's food that he had "puted drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message that he had accidentally put methane fetamin into beans.
According to the Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows that Medina Hernández turned back to the camera and was stuck behind the microwave.
It is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table to put a dip in a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff has stated that there are no customers who have been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was jailed in Marion County instead of $250,000 bail.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has been a criminal record of assault, robbery, suffrage, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Mr. Kaneko emphasized that "It's not quite possible to start the construction of a lot of problems after organizing them all."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea, and we must talk about it."
The prefectural side is concerned that spring water from the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he recognized that it would be difficult to think about the safety of the construction, although it would be possible to do it realistically.
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the change of route mentioned was "not possible."
The impact on the opening period included three locations: the South Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station and Nagoya Station, which took a particularly long time for construction.

5 Medical institutions in Saga Prefecture | Administrative and Social News | Saga Newspapers
Five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced the hospital's name on 26 March that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare needed to reorganize and integrate.
The total population of 13 medical institutions in the prefecture is 38 and 5%, which is the tenth highest in the country, and three have already been integrated and transferred.
The hospital in the prefecture is known as the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki Town, Mie Prefecture), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Citizen Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Taramachi Tatara Hospital in Fujitsu County.
The city of Imari Matsuura Hospital was relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating surplus in recent years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi stressed that "the town itself operates alone and has a concept of working with hospitals in neighboring towns, and hospitals must be left absolutely for residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The Director of the Office of the Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "We don't hear the contents from the prefecture," and stated that "We will actively participate in the Regional Medical Design Coordination Conference in the prefecture and respond to it based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not mechanically determined by the direction of public hospitals, but it is accepted that the local medical planning coordination meeting in each prefecture asked to reconsider again."
The representatives of the prefectural medical department who explain the country's thoughts to each medical institution said, "I would like to listen carefully to the parties about future hospital operations.
In some cases, it may be necessary to review medical subjects and to further reduce the sickbed."

Secrets of the Royal Family: A surprise frequent guest of the Royal Family.
As part of public service, the Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world.
In most cases, it is easy to use a private machine that travels around the world for important events and appearances.

Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, like most important royal customers, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggy Dog is famous, and it is not surprising to ask if you want to take a cute pet together to travel.
Queen Elizabeth loved dogs from childhood, and it is said that she had more than 30 coggy dogs since she became queen.
In 2007, he had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linet, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, five Cocker Spaniel vists, oxo, flash, pick, and spans were added, as well as four Daxmund and Coggy mix dogs cider, Berry Balkan, and Candy.
The staff on the Royal Air Force will be busy.
The royal staff were witnessing that they had been asked to leave the dog on the lawn before boarding, and Seals continued.
I've never been in an accident.

According to the narrator, "The Queen's luggage was 12 tons at 44,000 miles in 1953."
It can be understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
However, it is not only the queen who loves fashion.
The Marquis of Cambridge is also said to have its own taste when carrying his clothes, and in Uwasa it takes one seat per dress.

In a frank conversation, Mrs. Motonaga recalled how her mother and mother changed herself.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "The mother is like being in an advanced class to let go."
My job was almost always to find myself that children want to grow and keep a suitable distance.
To find out who they are, in essence, not the ideal for children as parents or the admiration of their childhood.
Mrs. Obama, who really knows the pressure on spotlights in the world, advised Duchess little by little in the interview of Good Housekeeping.
sometimes the pressure from yourself and people around me is too big.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't have time to do anything.
In the first few months of the White House, instead of starting to work ambitiously, the girls began their school life well and careed for new friends.
I think it's good, but rather good.

Trump Hotel owner's right to complain, liquor sales license holds.
Washington (AP) - The Commission on Alcohol and Drinks in Washington State dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel, as the owner's reasonable question was raised.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three members, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders that most petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, it is the second time that an appeal to the cancellation of the right to provide alcohol at the Hotel was made based on a state law requiring the applicant to obtain a license to sell alcohol.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year included repeated frauds against Trump's assault charges and violating state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already granted.
This was the second time that the petition was issued to update the permit.
The honey collected by the beekeeper FlyingBees is the first harvest!
How do you taste honey collected by FlyingBees who are bred on your knees?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September.
More than 100 bottles of honey were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make beekeeping on a factory site where cars were assembled?
I want to taste this!
Bentley's honey is here (11 pieces)
Peter Bosch, director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant.
From wildflowers planted on the site and mountains around the area, the beekeepers watched the appearance of bees gathering various flowers.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been working on a wide range of activities to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers through its Crew Plants and our business.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the amount of beet honey harvested.

The Cleveland Police, which continues to scandal, is said to be the worst in the UK in a violent report.
A police officer who followed the scandal was accused of being the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud, which was inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continued to "a serious deterioration," and Phil Gomley of the Police Department said.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect socially vulnerable.
Phil Gomley of the Police Bureau said, "We're continuing to make a lot of serious deterioration since our last investigation."
The police chief Mike Vill resigned in January less than a year, but he was "very serious" about his actions, but was investigated for multiple charges of unpublished.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee for the illegal act, because he worked for his colleagues to act sexually.
He resigned from the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Home Affairs intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Bar was a "criminal" and impeachment was necessary to settle.
Nobody knows what's going on.
Currently, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, and it may take some time to investigate," said Pelosi in Congress to interview CNN.
"We're going to do a job that we're starting to do based on the time it takes to discover facts and facts," said Pelosi.
This week's White House record revealed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Vladimir Zellensky to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zellensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Juliani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN first noticed internal accusations against Trump's actions involving Ukraine for more than a week before formal inquiries on Thursday.
The Ministry of Justice, accused of inquiry by information agencies, found that Trump's telephone talks were not covered by the investigation of violations of political funds.
In response to Barr's question of whether to testify, Pelosi stated Friday that he would decide who the intelligence special committee would testify.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"It was the name of the bar from beginning to end," said Pelosi, who touched Trump's name on the telephone talks in July with the Ukrainian president.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will approach judgment on the disposal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" about the whistleblowers who became the source of information when Trump attacked the accused on Thursday as a spy.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that internal accusations play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to the whistleblowers is a significant loss in the government."
On Tuesday, he spoke of suspicions about pressure on foreign leaders for political profits, and announced that Trump would formally impeachment Trump, and wrote a historic step.
The content of the call was included in the accusations released on Thursday, which claimed that Trump abused his office to seek intervention in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from their ministerial-level computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the review committee
Cofi Manuel, the football administrator and executive officer of Secondi Hasccus, expressed concern about the composition of the review committee for the next Ghana Football Association (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davis and expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Mr. Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the results of the judging process, and that it was fair or doubtful to include the chairman.
The review committee should be composed of fair and neutral members from outside of the previous interests, whether they have any relationship with each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, Manuel argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manuel suggested that if the Olympic Board member Fred Papoue attended the committee, the relationship between the club and the chairman would result in a conflict of interest, while Palmer would attend the committee, suggesting that prejudice and injustice would be biased.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after the inauguration of the ceremony held at the GFA Akra Secretariat on September 19 (Thu).
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Akpocavi, a sports director.
A survey of the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture believe that the minimum wage rate should be 1,000 yen.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of plans was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees.
The number of companies who answered "approved" to raise the yen was 100 percent, construction (70-60%), wholesale (61-70%).
In contrast, the majority were manufacturing (51-90%) and service businesses (60-90%), including food and drink, and accommodation (60-90%).
The representative at the conference said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with a lot of parts and hours."
The average amount of money paid was 895 yen (from 4 October to 829 yen in Fukui Prefecture).
After hearing the employment status of the company in March 2007, new graduates of regular employees were 61-3%, mid-term employment was 54-5%, and non-regular employment was 15-4%.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the scheduled number was 44, 7 percent, 50 and 3 percent, while non-regulars remained 31 and 1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (including 13 and 3 percent of new graduates, 37 and 5 percent in the middle) and construction (24, 1 percent of new graduates, 38 and 1 percent in the middle) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% were employed, and in many cases the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government for recruitment were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the second graduate (departure within three years of graduation) and mid-career recruitment.
There was also a view to encouraging students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-sector and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied, "It is already accepted."
One third of the total was admitted, including 20/3 percent of the "I intend to admit in the future."
The company was 64.4%, with construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%), and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Timplrick, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiprick said that Wales would host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Walladés, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D, and perhaps the semi-finals against France or Argentina will be sure.
On the other hand, if Australia, which has played 15 matches, wins 14 against Wales, Tiprick and his team will be one of the best eight races in England.
"It's a matter of course, I want to challenge both teams and win at the top of the group."
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last autumn.
Australia thinks it's going to be a lot of blame for returning the loan, but it's time to make sure you win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I'm here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have won only one World Cup in the past, and Wallad's victory in the third place was 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the total score for the Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight 3 team was only 7 wins during 41 rounds.
Wales stopped at 13 November Test Match Australia last year, but Tiprick included several representative members who won the match 9-6 and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
I'm sure the match was good, and maybe I thought that everyone should win, but I don't know.
As a result, he scored about 15 points in the final game, so he seemed to be far less competitive than actually."
In order to win Wales, the key is the breakdown battle between the Australian duo, Michael Hopper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Back Lo.
Tiplrick, who has previously played 67 international matches, has fought several matches or two players in the past and knows what is waiting for.
"They're definitely a global backs player," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you're going to face a tough game.
They are always the best in the world.
I'm sure what kind of game will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in defensive battles, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when needed.
I want to increase myself by fighting against the world's best players rather than fighting backro.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against the two, you have to keep yourself up.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important match for us.
momentum is important.
If you pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose on the momentum.

Meeting of the Government Subcommittee on the treatment of the first nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Tokyo, on the afternoon of the 27th

(Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd.), a government small committee on the 27th to consider the treatment of water that is increasing at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, presented equipment and concrete procedures that would be expected to emit marine and water vapor as a means of disposal.
Because it contains radioactive tritium, it is necessary to check the concentration of substances and detect abnormalities before release.
A member of the committee said, "I want to clarify how much time it takes," "It is different from the release of the fishery in Fukushima in a situation where the fishery is not recovering and releasing it to some extent.
We should also consider the time axis of society."

If Yoshimoto Kogyo has 90 percent of the gala, would it be a gift from performers?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo, which triggered the dark sales of antisocial forces, have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto spoke at the press conference on July 22, saying, "The company is 9 and there is no talent like 1 or so," on average, "5:5 to 6:4," but the geisha protested.
If the ratio of "9:1" is 90 percent, it is considered that there were gifts from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and investors who were taxed are also on Twitter.
If Galla's deal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was asked by Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to a gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not the subject of gift tax in the first place.
If it was "9:1," Yoshimoto Kogyo will benefit 90 million yen from sales of 100 million yen and cost of 100,000 yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you're wondering about distribution, it doesn't mean that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should have given.
And I think the amount I received is reported as sales.
If the person who gave the gift does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if he was an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) away from the original market for tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as this time, a third party will not decide on how much tax appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one-yen payment bills are poisonous.
[Interview cooperation tax accountant] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working as a bank, after graduating from university, he registered as a tax accountant in 2008.
University lecturers, seminars, and writing are broad.
It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for beginners in accounting.
the white house, the impeachment of the impeachment, a panic.
White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and detailed officials in this issue explained that there was no plan to deal with the emerging reality for a week.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have been increasing concerns, anxiety, and concerns about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't think it's true."
The White House officials were joking about the lack of clear plans for this situation, and the fact that the usual measures that the president has been able to do so well can not be applied, the more serious this claim is, so there was no confidence in how to proceed, "It seems that the next news will be erased."
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state with a great shock" as the president's impeachment response would increase the likelihood of being "neared in hand" if the impeachment was prolonged.
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the President is expected to be raised every day, and some of the close associates of the President are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable actions and concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means are spurred by concerns about President and Politics in the environment of election year.
Trump faced the greatest threat ever before in his term of office, and revived his strategy, which he considered effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Morler, as well as becoming a defender and changing his hands.
Trump attempted to take a light look at the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate with the investigation of the political enemies, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and also attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblowers as a motive for the factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the trial of Morale, but this time they began to feel the difference, and they said.
Although he is a brand president, he seemed to be visiting at a press conference on Wednesday, and he said he was familiar with the situation.
Although Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russian alleged investigations, it was not a border to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers have identified the fact that President Trump, Vladimir Zellensky, and Ukrainian presidents did not have direct information on the call, which has been controversial, claim that it is a fact that undermines the creditworthiness of the whistleblowers and are convinced that damage can be reduced.
In addition, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, Republican strategic families near the White House point out that the basic support rate of the president is already very high and the effectiveness of impeachment to acquire new supporters is not much.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those who claim impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how the response of the president would be an indeterminate element.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the plan, this initiative is still in the early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as strategic decision rooms will be implemented.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have a clear leader who can organize public relations activities aggressively in order to counter the momentum that the publication of organized legal strategies and communication strategies, and the publication of critical internal accusations to the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic viewpoints is clearly visible, such as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Finance Stephen Munshins, who stated that they would not publish notes on the call with the Ukrainian president of Trump 48 hours later.
According to Robert Morler's investigation, which has only stated little inconsecution, the pressure is likely to increase now.According to the person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitble of Trump, and the Corrie Luwanduski, who was the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwanduski told NBC news that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never talked to the president or close adviser about participating in a team that counters this false impeachment."
Trump's external attorney Jay Cellow is also involved in impeachment efforts.
In an interview with NBC News, Crow replied, "The problem is properly handled."
Emmet Frad, who was involved in the impeachment of Clinton and led the White House until the end of Morler's investigation, left the White House, and Pat Cipolon, the current White House legal advisor, lacks such experience, and the White House currently lacks lawyers with experience of impeachment.
More information on the White House strategy is generally recognized that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but must be organized and able to lead all the efforts and political struggles that have total power.

Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter Morikawa) Speaking of distant love, the survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touching), smelling (no smell), kissing (taste).
However, in the case of distant love, there are cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing only situations.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to an opponent's house, you'll have time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if you're on a holiday to heal the fatigue of your work, your body will be the key.
I feel comfortable when I return.
Is that the only way to break away?
Morikawa I think it will work if there are couples who can endure even if they don't meet frequently or couples who have a certain period of time in advance.
I'm married a year later, or I'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you don't see a future landing point.

devin nenes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, in a comment to defend the president, he accused the Democratic Party of trying to get the presidential nude photo.
Members of the House Information Special Committee of the Republican Party, Nunes, filed an appeal at the beginning of a hearing on internal charges that Trump had asked for a Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son to investigate.
The member accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the full naked picture of the President, stating Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with Ukrainians who seemed to be Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude pictures."
It is natural that everyone asks why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the President, and that there is a chance within a year.
After Nunes' scolding, HuffPost's journalist Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine if the Democratic Party members were looking for the truth.
He was the only member of the House of Representatives from the Democratic Party of Connecticut, but many other members questioned whether the answer was a red naked truth.
Medire Dotcom speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to "more detailed details of unidentified details" that are said to have been written in a steel document that has been discussed.
It is a notorious report that former intelligence officer Christopher Steel collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected in Trump viewing the urination of prostitutes in a hotel in Moscow.
Origami, wallet and real card.
Money transfer, loan, insurance and investment - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to make payments by Origami Pay as well as transfer money (moving) through collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investment, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, growing, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the challenges of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have an Origami ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get information timely.
He also explained that by deploying not only the Origami app but also on partner companies' apps, it would be possible to use the service even if you don't have the Origami app.
In terms of loans, we introduce functions that can be paid after in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were needed suddenly, the Origami app was completed from application to repayment.
In terms of insurance, he introduced his first life as a partner.
The two companies said they would use their data and knowledge to develop insurance products along the life event.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually through registration of necessary administrative agencies.
New businesses for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that it will launch a new business that will support effective utilization of data, including data owned by companies, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its payment and settlement functions provided by Origami.

On September 7, a ceremony was held in Aweena Osaka, Osaka City to commemorate the singer Mitoko Ogasawara, who died at the age of 100 in July.
the people involved showed the representative songs of Ogasawarasan
About 140 people from Japan participated, including the chairman of the General Union Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Mr. Eisai, and Mr. Yukie Ikebe, chairman of the Japan-Korea Music Arts Exchange Association.
In the ceremony, Mr. Yukie IKEBE gave a speech.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I still can't believe that the teacher passed away."While preparing for "Remembers," Ms. Mitsuko Ogasawara felt how wonderful and great he was."
On the other hand, he said, "If we can do activities that can expand our meetings even if we can."
After his dedication, Messse-ji, who was sent by Mr. Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the Korea Institute for Arts and Exchange in Korea, was introduced.
the potential to reduce emissions by renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only aircraft to fly in the sky and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta developed a technology to use renewable biofuels as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor of bioenvironmental science at Alberta, started the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as fat fat, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology uses low-quality fats for production, while carbon emissions are less than 85% lower than crude oil-based fuels, making it possible to utilize waste from other industries in the production process.
This technology also acts as a reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology is the hydrocarbon of the molecule itself in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technologies tend to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma that doesn't matter," Bresler said.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options: biofuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler described the second option: "You can try it with a reactor to change chemical reactions a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the US Army increasing investment in renewable options, Fortune Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes."
I want to prepare an alternative to the worst case.
Currently, Foj operates a test plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center, and recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin as a supporter to build 2500 million production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce about 1900 million liters of biofuel per year.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but it is not possible to reduce fuel transport and production.
"As a technical shop," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decision given.

Boris Johnson warned that Britain would face riots like Los Angeles if Brexit was over.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first results, there was a risk that a violent riot by the people would occur in this country.
The Prime Minister's officials warned that Britain would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
Johnson stated that it was necessary to "teach anger" against political words exchanged with intense speech, but argued that the term "default" would not be used.
Despite the appeal of the prime minister to regain his calmness, some ministers said in the Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Yellow Best Movement or the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement - they've encrypted their phones and compiled a demo, and a few populists who use dirty hands to drive people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when four white policemen who were beaten by black taxi driver Rodney King complained that the jury was innocent.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstration participant Zire Joan, wearing the yellow vest, has caused confusion and destruction in the city of Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers noted Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to withdraw from the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, the 100 million people would be dissatisfied."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time until tens of thousands of people go through the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first result, there would be a risk of "a fierce riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing the House Rebellion, which seeks to lower demands for EU withdrawal and instead hit the EU with compromises.

Pakistan, the older brother of social media celebrity, was sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is long and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderers are bailed out and the memory of the incident fades.
The women's rights activist, Farzana Bali, the first gender faculty founder of Pakistan's university, said it took more than three years to solve even the Barochi case, which is attracting attention.
Although human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "respectful murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the number of real honor murders is much more than that, but it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorary homicides occurring every year around the world are occupied by Pakistan.
Countermeasures against pork cholera 1.3 billion yen To add to the September correction plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo! News
It was reported by the Council on September 26 that the prefectural government would add 1,4800 million yen to the supplementary budget plan for September 26 to the government's decision-making cost of 116 million yen (about $12 million) for the pig cholera emergency project and $12 million for the land acquisition of the JR Numazu Station elevated project.
It is proposed by the prefectural assembly on 27th.
As a result, the total amount of public accounting for the supplementary budget for September was 81.87 million yen.
With new pig cholera outbreaks in Saitama Prefecture, the prefecture has expanded the disinfection point of livestock transport vehicles currently in Konishi City to three locations, including Gotemba City, Fujinomiya City, and Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City, near the Kanto region.
The total cost of the project was 7.7 million yen.
In addition, in order to prevent infection from wild boars, which are the main infectious pathways, we will start measures to capture wild boars in areas other than western prefectures and confirm that they are not infected with pig cholera.
The cost of capturing and inspecting 1560 heads in eastern and central prefectures is 58.6 million yen.
In the case of the decision-making procedure related to the elevated Numazu Station, the cost of entrusting the evaluation of the planned site to be obtained and the operating costs associated with the holding of the committee for the use of the equipment are added.

Floods and catastrophes caused by monsoons in many areas
The monsoon season in India is about a month long, an unprecedented rainfall caused by buildings collapsed and many of the crops began to rot.
Monsoon in northern India usually weakens its power at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month has increased by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, Monsoon will weaken in the late decades.
Many areas in India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in the western part of India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays caused the collapse of buildings and the disaster.
The houses were flooded, and the residents moved through the streets with water to kneel, usually seen only at the peak of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Lakna and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Utah, heavy rains have caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for the possibility of drought.
Longing monsoons for farmers are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarkand, said, "We are making cabbage, beans, peas, tomatoes, but vegetables are rotting in rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak Monsoon.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pens) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees (about 1 pound).
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dašera on October 8, where Hindus set up Ravana, an evil smile figure of the beard that appears in the huge comic book-style doll, epic "Lamaryana."
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the dolls are made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, then the last laugh may be Ravana.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
The latest research shows that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to a group of men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective gears when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from over 6,000 men living in Oahu, who participated in the Kakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this study could not be applied to women and other races, as only Japanese-American males.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
This study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to aging and hiding possible relationships between pesticides and mental disorders in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Zerrensky: Poloshenko intervention at the Trump telephone meeting
The U.S. President Donald Trump's impeachment process was a dramatic week in Washington's political affairs.
For political beginners, Volozimir Zellensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump phone problem so far?
At the beginning of the telephone meeting, Trump told Zellensky that the United States has provided various conveniences to Ukraine from other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the fact that Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders were dedicated to speaking more concrete proposals.
Zerrensky's response to Trump's 100 percent argument is disputed.
Zellensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian president Petro Poloshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the support including the sanctions and economic assistance of the EU during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voyticus said, "Is it possible to negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Following Trump's request for military assistance, instead of one, to ask Zellensky for two surveys, the first is to suggest that Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is to investigate the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would interfere with European relations or lay back water against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
Thanks to the announcement of the call, I would like to thank the supporter."
Zelensky will meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
He won two awards in Ghana and the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded by Ghana to provisionally acquire the effective implementation rate of 89.89% and to receive the highest score in Africa by air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activity (ICVM) on April 3, 2019, following the United Nations Air Force's Global Safety and supervisory audit report.
The safety award was approved by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding safety at airports and their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of the support of the ICAO Zero Campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications and 17 certifications were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Minister of Aviation Joseph Cofi Ada Ghana, Director of Civil Aviation Simon Alati Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aico Otou to Canada, and Director of the Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
The Chairman of the Council of International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Benad Aliu, stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to remain aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also stated that the award was a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's efforts and patience.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a great future to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to change our lives dramatically."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump and Peter Gaino appointed FEMA Chief Officer: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Secretary of State for Emergency Management Peter Gayno smiled at the National Security Senate Committee at Capitol Hill, Washington, United States.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gayno as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Director of FEMA, was the deputy director of government disaster response, such as hurricanes and fires.
The office had been absent from the Senate since March, when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Security, the upper body of FEMA, decided that Long had illegally used government-owned cars to commute to work between Washington and his home, Noor Carolinea.
Mr. Jeffrey Baiard, one of the other recommendations, raised suspicions that he was drunk in alcohol and involved in the riots, and was excluded from the selection at the beginning of this month after the examination.
His appointment as director was as expected.
In the future, the majority of Senate approvals are required.
Before taking office as Deputy Secretary of FEMA in 2018, Mr. Gayno stated that he had served at the Emergency Management Bureau in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - The police closed illegal marijuana baying activities in San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of Butanhanie oil (intensified cannabis oil) was discovered at an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found equipment packed with bayp cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
Captain Cano said that he had previously been engaged in drug investigation and that he could fire during the process of extracting oil used for Bayp products.
"The static electricity from clothes can only be ignited, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," he adds.
In addition, if there were multiple containers, the entire building could be blown away as well as a fire one after another.
The group of hazardous substances was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
He received an anonymous information and told the investigators that it led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators still pursue who is the black curtain of illegal Beip activities.
The police said that the office was empty and that Zhang himself had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that, in particular, they would like to receive recent news related to the danger of bating, tend to be illegal bating products and not go out.

In the middle of the concert, there was a 6-strong earthquake!
Evacuation training at the hall in Miyazaki City - Yahoo! News
A practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held every year.
At the stage, a performance by the Miyazaki City Firefighters is performed, and it is assumed that a seismic intensity of 6 people will occur during the song.
About 300 people participated in training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff.

The participants increased their awareness of disaster prevention through training.
Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was woven with silver foil threads made of the finest camlet silk, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Herstic Royal Palace dress collection curator, Eli Lin, has decided to be one.
This fading piece of cloth, which was hung on a wall of a small church in one country, was placed there 100 years ago, and is considered part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this gorgeous cloth used as the altarpiece of the church in Bactton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited at the Hampton Court Palace next month, near exactly that room where the Queen of Tudor could wear more than 450 years ago.
Only one dress left in the 16th century was found in the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence that Elizabeth passed the sleeves to the dress, the study of the three years increased the conviction of experts that the dress was not part of the royal possession.
The simple, expensive fabric "silver cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but the quality of plant and flower embroidery also suggests that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later was noble.
It is believed that the dress was the price equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions at that time.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rivals wearing such gorgeous clothing could not endure.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues' experts.
Everyone was always happy to hear that the cloth was "great," and I was convinced that they were watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of a dress that was cut and used as an altarpiece of the Church of St. Face in Bactton is not as unexpected.
Bactton is a native village of Brunswick Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Elizabeth's long life, and is said to have long been associated with Parry.
Although the dress dates back to 1590, experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and a very delicate hand-sewing altar cloth, will be exhibited next to Elizabeth's portrait of a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition period.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, and the preservation work is done almost here, and Libby Thompson, who taught the work, said, "I feel really respect for the craftsmanship of the people who made it."
When you look at the embroidered embroidery on the front and back, you will be very respectful to those who made it.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched and found" A week after the missing female child, the Self-Defense Force withdraws and the volunteer men are missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It's a week since the first year of elementary school girls are missing at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Force, which still has no clue, closed the search and withdrew on 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, a first-year student in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared, and the search for the 28th was started at 6 a.m. with about 240 police and SDF personnel.
However, the village requested to withdraw from the Self-Defense Force as "the scope of the request has been searched."
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Force launched a total of 650 people, mainly on the slopes of the mountain and the dangerous places such as Sawa.
On the 27th, there was no way to find a 20-year-old man who participated in the search by volunteers.
The police and fire departments are planning to continue searching from 6:30 am on 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters were seeking to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation, as compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member is the lowest in the country in July this year.
In the first oral statement held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that "the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional."
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendants asked for a rejection of the claim as "not even though it was in a significant inequalities that were likely to cause the issue of constitutionality."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

one third of the drugs in the united states
Chicago After the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Department of Narcotics (DEA) revealed what was going on in white daylight.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose.
McNight said that 90% of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican narcotics king named El Mencio Servantes.
The Mexican agent Matthew DonahewDEA said, "Mencho is the first person to ask DEA and the top priority of the federal law enforcement agencies."
El Mencho's winnings reach $1 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were violent.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva, is involved in at least one third of drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, Cartel has sold a large amount of cocaine, methane phenyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $1 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and returned to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
In fact, Donahhe said he owns his own special mobility team.
From the death of six Mexican helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders have occurred due to drug trafficking.
According to the Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occurred a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican narcotics are toxic, so they must wear protective clothes when handling them.
At the manufacturing center, the bag of cocaine is engraved with the sealant.
More than one third is believed to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahew said, Mencho is involved in the influx of harmful substances that effectively exploit the lives of innocent women and children.
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahhe said that it was "probably" drugs brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news, PS4 game was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to Last of As.
Some of the video games of this new action game were shown by fans.
A few days after the Last of As2 news, further details were announced.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in many ways.
Since the era of PSwan, the last of the as part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Notydog Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous work, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to tell the story that there were so many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game did not go into a single blue ray, and it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it is not possible to ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs in the game include nostalgic notydog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 only on PS4, you will see a lot more.
Those who have PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered with PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced a free PS4 game for PlayStation Plus, including the aforementioned Notic Dogs.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like Last of As Remastered and want to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including popular character Erie backpacks and bracelet replicas, and bonus versions with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Transportation Sales "Hidekaru" Council attempts Residents wish to continue (Khokukoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of the island of Noto in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging population, traffic sales started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council, which was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagon cars with daily supplies, seasonings, and food ran through Susomachi Kai and Hanura Town Kai on the first day.
Some of the products were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and the residents asked them to continue saying, "It's fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, city-designated garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, a total of vegetables such as potato salad and kinpira gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Susomachi-kai, the population was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the Council expressed his surprise that "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with his husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I don't know when my father can drive, I hope he will continue."
Users also received orders such as "I don't want a can coffee, but I want you to bring coffee that you want to flip."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell the goods to save "shopping weak."
By December, we will examine whether the 20-machi-kai in the island will be held once a month and whether it will continue as a business after next year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that the drought-stricken population had decided to add about $1 billion.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been greatly reviewed for simplicity.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-stricken community support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-related areas, up to 13 municipalities provide assistance to drought relief funds with a maximum of $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion budgets for drought relief.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing four of Stephen and Katie Stay and five children.
Haskell said on July 9, 2014 that he was in the house of Stay and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent, but she had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old, nine and seven years old were killed.
In his family, only one person, the fifteen-year-old Cashy Stay, took his life.
At the time, the authorities reported that he was seriously injured, but then recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed allegations of innocence due to the loss of the heart of Ronald Lee Haskel.
The jury was dismissed from prison until Monday.
"If you choose to disappoint us, never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who was shocked by anger was echoed by the leaders of each country.
Global warming is getting worse.
At the UN Climate Action Summit held in New York City, Swedish 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of parliament, and became a fireman to spread the school strike all over the world.
The young people who raised anxiety and anxiety protested all over the world, including Japan.
It is estimated that about 4 million people participated in more than 150 countries.
Morioka also marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century, to less than twice the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution and to 1-5 degrees if possible.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed countries and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to be associated with global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is frequently observed in various places.
In order to increase global warming at a faster pace, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit, which was realized by the call of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal to virtually zero by 50.
Other 70 countries raised their targets for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which expressed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not explicitly express their new goals, and the slow movement of the emitter power became apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as the second half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at an environmental-related meeting, said that he should work on fun, cool, and sexy at a conference on climate change.
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of environmental movement.
The injury, which cannot be discussed, will not be included in the "replacement of issues" that the person counters.
There is no longer a grace to combat global warming, and the international community must respond to the common crisis of mankind.
It is not possible to achieve sufficient effectiveness in each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
If you don't take that future, you should act as an adult.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The research results of the United States Army approached the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to secure military safety, measure and measure time functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Distributed Quantum Information Center of the Army Research Institute of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between matter and light - 50 km away using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state, and one is measured, even if the other quantum bits are physically distant, then the other is affected by the measurement results.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building a intercity quantum network," says Dr. Ben Lañon, an experimental physicist at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bit points in entangles despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the variance of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains enough quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum network use.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and at the same time excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with fiber optic cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Dr. Lañon.
The team first sent the light particles through non-linear crystals with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, which is the standard wavelength of long-distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a fiber optic cable 50 km long.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms can capture calcium at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangled network in long-range atomic clocks.
The large Entangle clock network is a very important field for the Army from the viewpoint of accurate positioning, navigation, and time-keeping applications."
