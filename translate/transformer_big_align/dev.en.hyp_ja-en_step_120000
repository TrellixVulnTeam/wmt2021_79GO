Croatia's nuclear treatment facility plan, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the town of northwestern Bosnia and protested the next Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered at Novi Grado in the town of Bosnia strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the Turgovska Gola barracks and fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," and "We need a solid blocker."
We must oppose it.
The head of the municipality of Novi Grado, Miloslav Draka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko nuclear power plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
On Friday, Croatian national broadcasters reported that Croatia had not yet decided to build its own storage facility or to pay for the cost of the waste of Croatia being processed by newly built facilities.
Croatian Minister of Environmental Protection and Energy, Tomislav Chorich, told the announcer that Croatia has a problem with public waste disposal from schools, hospitals, and prisons, and wants to find a full solution.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents of the country claimed that Croatia would seek another construction site on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket be the best place in Croatia?"

PayPay salesman "Get on the Wave" "Cashless to wake up" (Tokai TV) - Yahoo!
The consumption tax started in October.
The country begins with the cashless point reduction project.
It is to reduce the coldness of consumption by up to 5%.
[Looking at the picture] just before the tax hike... shops and businesses were introduced to cashless.
So what's happening now is "introduction."
It is a cashless shop that has been a cash business.
I was close to the installation site.
"Cashlessing" is an introduction just before the tax hike.
"Okiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular restaurant operated by Takeshin confectionery, and in the shop there are more than 100 kinds of oysters.
On this day, Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.50 million users.
PayPay Yasuda: "Is there any payment method other than cash now?
Mr. Shinmi: "No, we are dealing with cash alone, oldfashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it will be easier than cash if I get used to it because it will not be possible to receive Tsurisen.
Up to now, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce 20% of usage by points.
As an explosive increase in the number of users, Yasuda is a salesman that sells the introduction of PayPay to customers, that is, the store.
"Okiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also heard from Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it's really busy, and I think it's a peak right now.If you don't know what you've been talking about before, or if you're going to do a consumer return business together, you'll be able to hear it on PayPay.
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the country's consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves, but the country's Consumer Reducing Business.
In October, the country introduced a system to reduce the consumption tax by 5% to consumers in order to prevent the cooling of consumption.
Like "Okiya Tatsushin," there are few small retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before tax increases.

What is the Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are sick.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is the story of Patton Hobert, who aims to become president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree producer Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinnes Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, despite the fact that humans under their protection were not seriously ill.
There are various types of pathology, including the Münchhausen syndrome, which is hypothesized to be a disease of himself.
However, the proxy Munchhausen syndrome is clearly hypothesized that others under their protection are ill.
This is also known as FII, counterfeiting or induced disease, and is a type of child abuse.
Although unusual symptoms, parents usually exaggerate symptoms or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what is the sign of Münchhausen syndrome?
Although the symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, NHS is listed as follows:
The child is healthy, but if the condition is poor, the medical practitioner will try to calm down.
I'll explain to you, or complain about false symptoms.
The test results are hoaxed to make the child feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing that it is diabetes.
Overdose medications and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How common is Muunchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000, estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.
what should we do if we suspect a child's damage?
Ask local social welfare agencies or call NSPCC Child Protection Helpline 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: police force the school of caduna, rescue 300 children.
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police conducted an investigation yesterday to the Imam Ahmed Bun Hanbal School in Rain Maidhuven Tsunma, Igabi jurisdiction, arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
The police said that the children were placed in a humanitarian environment, but the school denied this claim.
"The children are in school with parents' consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
The parents came to deliver a meal to their children every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were doing.
I was very surprised that the police came and evacuated the children, and after all the food delivered by parents left, the school closed.
There are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair treatment."
He added that the former police chief Abdullahman had visited once to see how the children were in the environment, but had never complained.
The children also learn about Corlan and say that it is all.
However, police chief Yakub Sabo said that the children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of getting knowledge about Corlan, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were injured on their back.
Therefore, we are investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

When I hear it, I can't help it."

The man's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development is based on public interest, warning IT representatives
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, investors, etc. that if there was no moral assessment of public interest on Friday, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met.
At the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions on the future and dangers of artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the development of war technology and the future of increasing machine work.At the same time, examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and the responses of social media companies during the atrocities were examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely on robotic engineering to pursue profit, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advancements are causing increasingly noticeable inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advancements are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, we will be going back to a state of barbarism based on strong theories.
According to the organizers of the conference, they would like to take advantage of the expertise of the participants in the conference and find the talent to become a future advisor to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.
Produced by Nagano surprise Go Abe's debut song is a hit!
thank you.
Hisayoshinote (34) in Hiroshima and Nagano started his career in the mid-day battle (Mazda) on the 27th.

Real Madrid's loan, player Martin Woodegor, and fan excitement with voice assist.
Martín Woodegor showed a surprise support for Michel Oyalusabar.
Real Madrid won the Ossana at 2-0, renewing the undefeated record in the current domestic season, leading to La Liga.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, including a fierce open battle and a public discord with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint Germain (PSG) in the Champeons League, the pressure seemed to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidan and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Arabes, and was surprised by Michel Oyalusaval's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won his home in 3-0.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite pass through the inside of the other two players to Oyaru Sabal, where he scored the goal with a completely accurate srubber.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third goal from the stunning Oyalusabar penalty spot, Alabeth's midfiller Manu Garcia secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before the end of 5 minutes.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
The Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated this territory.
Anna Hazale, the name of Sharad Powerle was amazing in the case of bank fraud in the Maharashtra state cooperative.
Anna Hazale said, "When I contacted this lawsuit, the name of Sharad Power was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the name of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud incident involving thousands of rupees.
The Executive Bureau of the Investigation Agency (ED) filed a fund-cleaning lawsuit against Sharad Powerll and his nephew, Deputy Minister of State Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Act on the Prevention of Fund Cleaning, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, accused of the name of the former chairman of the bank, Amit Powerll and the former staff of the former union bank of 70.
When he came to contact the lawsuit, his name was nowhere.
Anna Hazale said on Thursday that she only knew how the name of Sharad emerged and who mentioned it.
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Power, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerr denied any fraud and claimed that the joint bank had nothing to do with it, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the Maharashtra parliamentary election on October 21.
The former coalition minister clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
NCP referred to the lawsuit by the Executive Bureau as a formality.

Stop the accident!
Four Preliminary Supplies - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A car accident caused by a driver's mistake.
In particular, an increase in the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator steps by elderly drivers has been observed.
Especially when it comes to a sudden, it becomes a panic, and when you are going to step on the brake pedal, the accelerator remains on.
There is a new car equipped with a safety driver support function to cover such a driver error, but there is also a rearing device that can be attached to an unattended car.
Such an after parts manufacturer is developing and selling emergency prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and at the same time it passes.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] The "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot will inform you of the pedal mistake from a new perspective.
It is to avoid pedal stepping errors by " alarm sound."
When the mechanism is stopped or slow running, the " alarm sound" occurs when stepping on the accelerator pedal by mistake.
By reacting to the sound and prompting the accelerator to return, it avoids rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the step errors.
It is also effective for elderly drivers who are difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the body is attached with two-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excl. tax) and it is easy to set.
[Ashimori-kun] The world wing started its launch in mid-September, but the accelerator brake step prevention device "Ashi-no-kami-kun."
It is also possible to reverse (back) without advance.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is stepped suddenly, the vehicle's vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the rapid advance.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, do not tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantly control the advance by turning it into a creep running state (where the brake is separated by the D range).
At the back of the vehicle, it also detects the speed of about 5Km/h or more and features that force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The mounting is possible only with caplaron and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Ms. Suosato Kusumoto (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that the three-year-old child who liked the nursery school suddenly went to the nursery school after the flood damage, and was forced to leave at night.
"Because adults were busy cleaning up their homes and didn't have enough time to face them," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can't panic and say that children are okay."
Yukari Okushi (36) in Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
"If you have a child who can't stay still, use your mind around you."
The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, where there were five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend my time at home as much as possible during a disaster and has food and simple toilets.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparations will change in family configuration and living conditions."
Shinako Kawasaki (40) in Shiraishi-cho, with a child of six and eight years old, proposed that " elementary school had an e-mail from the school on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or email system.
There was also a request to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I don't know that the last time it was okay."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connection with people and prepare for disasters."
Tanaka said, "I think the opinion that was issued will be communicated to the government as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Urcuri
The Police Agency (IOPC) will examine whether the scandal in London's mayor's office should be investigated as a violation of the Penal Code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts on acts" on suspicion that Archery had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"The matter of conduct exists in the presence of information indicating that crime could have been done," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this issue.
The issue was entrusted to IOPC, but the IOPC was an agency corresponding to charges issued by the police in England and Wales.
This problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the police chief at that time.
Johnson denied cheating related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information about his relationship with the U.S. government, while claiming that he was "constitutional."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported that the U.S., who emigrated seven years ago to London, was paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the London mayor's era, and was given preferential treatment to join three foreign trade dispatchers together with Johnson.
Since then, the government has frozen a subsidy of 100,000 pounds to the hacker house, a company under the investigation.
The company will be asked questions about the investigation process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Waman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Ministry of Digital has "normally appropriate evaluation" and that the company owns the British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Curi (34) is currently based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among employees."
The move of GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
The government officials say that this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"In any case, the supervisory authority did not submit any evidence, and the Prime Minister had no opportunity to answer the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late on Friday night."
The people and the mass media will be able to see the political Kyogen played by the people.
As I mentioned earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Tourism and Regional Promotion Division was "public secret."
The former staff of the London & Partners (L&P) said that despite the fact that there was a person who considered the company "untrustful" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany the foreign trade-related talks led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund for ordinary people to use for property formation!
This is the 20th anniversary of Yahoo! News.
I heard the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Iwakami Tsushin.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
What are you feeling now?
First, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all those involved, not just the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the desire to support the formation of property for ordinary people.
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursued for 20 years.
If the general public is eliminated from the anxiety of money, the world will be brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operation is not performed unless you walk with beneficiaries.
A lot of money comes from the "Sawakami Fund" when the market plunges like the Lehman shock and the bursting of the IT bubble.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have been talking about since the time we have been doing so.
We believe that this is the reason why it became a long-term fund for 20 years and that it has continued to be a direct sales system that can deliver messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mcmirr's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested for drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling oxycodon counterfeit pills containing fenthanyl before Miller accidentally took over cocaine, alcohol, and Fentanil before he died, but Fentanil is a powerful opioid drug that is problematic as thousands of deaths occur in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Pett, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Pettyt had obtained drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Libis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, was accused of delivering drugs to Petty as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still an anti-verbal about individual cases.
Walter, currently in detention, was under probation for the 2005 drug case, and was sentenced to five months in prison in violation of his compliance.
The prosecutors in charge of the case first reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday requested that Walter be detained until the trial start due to the high possibility of escape from abroad.
There was no immediate response to the phone call message to the lawyer.
Pettyt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
The lyrics of Miller's lyrics include a frank word about depression and drug use, and have earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke out in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his own Instagram-loved mirror, and released a song titled "Sancue Neckst."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with opioid drug abuse in recent years.
The rock band Three Doors Down guitarist Matthew Roberts died in 2016 due to excessive intake of drugs, and Fenthanyl and Hydrocodon were detected in the body.
This article corrected the spelling of Walter's name as Stephen instead of Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch2 to create a hidden game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime, and stories on and off-line.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats that come out of hiding places.
He learned how to make games in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN that he spent time making games when he was bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day short-term intensive course for children aged five to fifteen.
The course hosted by Codefest International was introduced to give children such as Basil a chance to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in numerous mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a bit angry," his father said.
"I've always been playing games, but what do you want to make games yourself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basil, who had been interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step in making the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has the name of his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world and the younger generation, like Basil-chan, is led by African innovation.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds have been awarded a robot that uses program code to divide housework.
In May 2019, a women's high school team from Ghana who programming boxed robots won the Robofest contest.
African investment by Google and Microsoft giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil-chan and the children of the same age are going to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the Republican Party of North Carolina, acquitted for bribery.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman faked federal agents who conducted corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the list of federal court cases, Robin Hayes is guilty next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware of false statements by FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which charges Hayes deems.
Hayes was initially accused of conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor accused Hayes of being involved in a plan to serve as a senior insurance company to fund the election to the Secretary of Insurance.
Both Greg Lindberg and his co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindberg, founder of insurance and investment companies, has donated more than $500 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported Republican principles and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer asked him to comment on Friday and email, but he did not reply.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the Defendant of Hayes, also called for additional comments by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes did not speak with Corsey about the state insurance staff.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutors said he helped Lindberg's request that Hayes would like to meet Cosey, and spoke directly with the supervisor.
The prosecution, published in April, claimed that Lindberg had sought special treatment for his insurance business, and that he was planning to commit $2 million to an election campaign aimed at re-election in Kosey in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindberg's company.
Republican Corsey reported alleged attempted bribes to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no doubts.
Indictment is described in a conversation involving Lindberg and Cosey that Lindberg co-owners instructed Hayes to send $50,000 to Cosey's re-election campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would draw attention if he did so much money, but he eventually broke out in the conversation.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes said, "What do you want?"
i know, i'll do it.
The U.S. Attorney General asked an e-mail for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like other people's posts!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, is a good thing!
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager Mia Garrick said that this change was based on feedback from mental health professionals who would consider the number of happy surveys and the cause of social comparisons.
Garlic said, "There was a very positive feedback from many bullying groups and mental health organizations that are working together."
The user only deletes the numbers so that they can focus on the quality and content of the exchange, rather than the number of reactions.
Garlic said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick also stated that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test was conducted, and the test was conducted in the same manner.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test ends or changes.
"There were initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, who is in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very aggressive Facebook and Instagram user.
He thought Australia would be a great country to get really good feedback on whether this was a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag and I couldn't move anywhere.
If my favorite bag is broken, I want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
At that time, I was able to help Cando's handcrafted parts.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, the chin is the ultimate pchipra.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main body greatly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for what changed to this connected fitting.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Candy, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I found it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be 100%.
Originally it is a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
It was planned to be used one by one on both ends of the bag handle, and we bought two pieces.
The size of the ring is small, but if you look at the bag fittings on one side left, make the same thing at all ...
This opened the road to bag repair.
It is a smooth installation.
what?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
The color of the fittings is good for the gold system ♪ However, because the ring size is small, it is difficult to move ...
So I tried to make a ring in two pairs.
Although the number of fittings increased, due to lighter parts, there was no problem with weight.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts has increased and the design level has been improved.
The express train "Aso" of the JNR took a temporary train, Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for the departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train that was inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 people including railway fans boarded 12 blue passenger cars from Hiroshima Station and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destiny Campaign" by JR companies, a tour was organized.
The train is a seven-car train consisting of a passenger and a locomotive.
A special headmark was drawn by Asoyama.
his brother's life imprisonment with the honor murder of a Pakistani social media star, kandir balochi.
Candy Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, the popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the most attention of his father-in-law, Pakistan.
In July 2016, the famous Baroch was strangled.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
A few days later, at a press conference, his brother said that he killed his sister, and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardahl Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
The lawyer said, "Insharah (God's thoughts) will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that he wanted his son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Balochi's murder became a major news all over the world, and as lightening the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, were killed, and the so-called "principal murders" were reburning.
Women chose their marriage partner by themselves, and in the case of Mr. Barochi, they were burned by crimes such as praise of their sexuality and shameful of their families.
The killing is usually done by relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow the perpetrators to forgive and request from their relatives.
Three months after Burrought's murder, Congress passed a new bill that required life imprisonment for honorable murder.
However, whether homicide is an honorable crime is held at the discretion of the judge, the killer can claim another motive in theory and may be pardoned.
In the case of Baroch, his parents initially insisted that his son not be pardoned.
However, the parents who were sad about losing their son changed their thoughts and asked them to forgive their son.
With the international hatred of killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented means of declaring the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team, and wearing a straight red dress that opened widely on Valentine's Day.
Although it became critical and threatening, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that it opened a new heaven and earth in a country considered to be a bold and political activity to express itself as a presence like Kim Kardashian.
The origins of the "principal" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, especially in women's actions, although men may be victims.

In the city of Tsuruoka, they escaped to the first evacuation site where they were located on high ground in each village.
Although the large tsunami did not occur, most of the refugees returned home without moving to a second-order evacuation site where accommodation facilities and facilities were well equipped, many of the first evacuation sites were asked to appeal cold because they were outdoors.
As a result of similar disaster preparedness, countermeasures against severe cold and wind rain were one of the challenges.
Seats that can cover the whole body during evacuation and break cold and wind rain.
It also has a heat insulation function in the flames.
The seat is about 1.3 meters x 2.1 meters, and when folded it becomes 9cm × 12cm pocket size.

【Asa Amami Sports Academy, NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda, Amami City) and ELOVE (President Junya Maeda, China Town) of Okinaga Sports Club signed a partnership to support the promotion of remote islands.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects conducted by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
The two organizations engage in training related to sports, mediating and dispatching exclusive trainers and instructors, and sharing information.
When a team of remote islands embark on an expedition outside the island, they work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in the event of a prefectural tournament and other events on the mainland, support is provided to prevent the player from losing their performance due to fatigue during a boat trip or staying overnight.
In addition, when the tournament is held on Amami Oshima and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players from outside of the island by cooperating with local recoil clinics and hospital officials.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Elabco in China-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.
After that, the two organizations co-hosted a training session by Athletic Trainer Yuichiro Hidaka.
Local sports boys, club leaders and parents learned the proper use of taping and prevention efforts.
Mr. Sonoda (52) said, "The purpose of the activities of eliminating the Handi of the island in terms of sports environment is common to each other, and there are many areas that can cooperate.
Mr. Maeda (43) said, "It is very hard to have a partnership with a proven organization like ASA, and I would like to absorb good things to improve the sports environment for children on the island."
Kenichiro Shigeki: "Now, the era of the conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Shigeki has been thinking twice about "mote."
A surprising "brain science monotheism" that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will send you a piece later.
In the first part (see related article), Mote-no-Otoko firmly adheres to the traditional "male fantasy" and the pattern learning to make it is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool man.
if you're stuck with it, you're going to live.
In the first part, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and behavior of people.
When learning patterns, I think that the brain will systematically act like this, so I think it will be possible to live in Lak.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether I'm "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit hard to say, "The teacher of the university is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say, "What should I do?" or "What should I do?"
Because people and society change even if they don't change themselves.
I talked about that in my recent interview book, "No matter how terrible it is in the world."
"It's heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by admitting people around them.
He doesn't want to be light.
It's hard to get around yourself.
I didn't know how to do it at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, his surroundings will be treated as "a great film director."
Those who have a proven track record need to behave greatly.
In other words, it can't be light if you're being bound by "thinkness."
As long as I heard from various women, regardless of position or age, it seems to be a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It's hard to say that this is cute.

Nigeria's Northwestern illegal state doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 due to increased violence over the past four months.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created, and by the end of this year each institution will work together to raise $35.5 million.
The UNHCR's Barbaru Barrok spokesman said that the Islamic extremist Boko Haram, who has been active in anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in the last 10 months in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok spokesman said on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, assault, murder and sexual violence were frequent, and that the raiders had destroyed and stolen houses.
Military and police are also sent to combat criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Boko Haram and the West African branch of the Islamic State, which broke out in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with the name of the group."
What they carry is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the coming months.
the new trial date for men killed two women and two children is confirmed.

The Service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a mechanism that allows media operators to prioritize high-priced ads by conducting fair bidding competition with multiple bidders.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
Until now, SSP has been provided for advertising.
In recent years, in response to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to certain advertising frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP began in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, directly buying advertising frameworks with advertisers' requests.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP's header binding allows them to participate in direct header binding bids and increase their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, due to the limited number of medium-sized companies, it is also possible to secure ad frame for delivery in line with individual commercial materials and brand images to prevent damage to brand value.
The benefit of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each Vidder company called the "Lapper Solution," which LFP is working together, will enable the implementation of media companies to follow.

Two months to stop Assistant Professor Yamagata at Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced on the 27th that an assistant professor at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Department of General Affairs, Assistant Professors of the University of Tokyo, from October 2017 to October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, they were emotional and abused in inappropriate words.
It has been recognized that the educational environment has deteriorated.
A survey conducted in September 18 reported several students.
In December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and in December of the same year, the U.S. campus faculty conducted a survey of harassment prevention measures committees.
Based on the findings from the committee, President Kiyohito Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
As an assistant professor, he continued his education after the survey, but his actions were improved through interviews and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Oyama said, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to take all of my studies to prevent harassment and work to recover confidence."
The university also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students led by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts The Sun Paper demands Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of EU withdrawal and to make compromises with the EU.
Now, just three weeks after the EU summit, which will be a settlement, there is growing concern that the prime minister might not be able to take a significant concession.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of withdrawal from the EU and a compromise with the EU.
The negotiations on a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are packed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative to "impossible."
The Senior Ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose a compromise, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers, who were ready to face the Prime Minister, after the Conservatives' annual meeting in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the "extraordinary" strategy that threatens the EU devised by the senior advisor Dominique Camings without agreement, and insist that the EU will accept the offer that the EU will take out of time limit.
One minister said that the ruling that the Supreme Court's closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday would be "the alarm," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House of Representatives, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use what can be used more than his steps.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and the plan of Camings is clearly unsuccessful.
It is impossible to fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised that he would speak to Johnson to carry out an agreement with Prime Minister Terryza May.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I'm going to tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many things that everyone is trying to end this.
If we do not postpone, Boris will end, and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer condemned Boris not seriously thinking about negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party gave a harsh speech: "The Prime Minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we do not see the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Ures, and discussing with the people in the streets.
The Prime Minister's spokesman acknowledged yesterday that the agreement was still a long time ahead and said, "If anyone does not think of it, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which forced a three-month delay in the absence of an agreement, would greatly weaken our position of negotiations in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue their progress despite the enactment of the bill."
The European Union Departure Minister Stephen Barclay returns to Brussels today to discuss further with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how the regulation of all Irish islands on food and livestock works.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lauren Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, revealed that he was told by the television chiefs that he would "not succeed."
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was so nervous," Kelly, 59-year-old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was still 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I was working as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewed by legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a TV-am Scottish correspondent in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast, and Daybreak, and later began a program named after her.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, she broadcast a special show that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
He added that passion, enthusiasm, and curiosity were the secret to survival in the television industry, and that the host said, "We must put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that the interview was "very painful" about the Danbourne shooting.
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think we were watching many of the families of the children who were killed or wounded who broadcast the show live from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna, personally told me to meet me, so we talked for hours at her house.
I went to Joanna funeral, Pam and I have been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McKan's daughter Madeleine were missing, saying that it was "very painful" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple really don't poison.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 am on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantine Chiwenga declined the offer of President Robert Mugabe, who had been in the midst of a political change, due to fears that he might be a trap to defer military action in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the Defense Forces continued, and Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give him the presidency, and the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week.
However, Chiwenga refused the offer because he saw the intention of Mugabe to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders of all over the world and the African Union that he was stripped of the regime in a coup, rather than anxiety, and government officials reported on social media.
According to a series of Twitter by Jamwanda2, officials confirmed that he was a high-ranking official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who had held the administration for 37 years, is willing to give his administration to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munngawa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, tried to contact the envoy to Chiwenga.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was carried out by three.
George Chalanba, president of Spokesman, and his high-ranking officials were involved in negotiations by Aaron Nepera, the top representative of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, and Fidelis Mukonoli, the Roman Catholic Bishop.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Zimbabwe Preparatory Bank, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Chiwenga alone.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to condemn the African Union's military action while seeking intervention by leaders from African countries.
The offer to give the presidency to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the choice of the former president.
"I began to suffer from fatigue in part of the late President's family, and was an act of abandonment to save the dangerous and rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, at least the political aim of the late president was to change the flow even in diplomacy.
If there was anything to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the views of the African Union on the coup, but I would like to remind you that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not be defeated.
The late President (Mugabe) hoped that Chiwenga, who was at the top of the military at that time, would break up the claims of the commanders claiming that he was trapped and not breaking the constitutional order.
The late President (Mugabe) hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, would decide whether to position it as a coup, would ultimately be considered valid for military intervention requests.
That was the intention and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe had to write his resignation.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that they would not turn guns to the citizens, even if they were intruding into a presidential house called Blueloo.
At that point, Mugabe wanted two things to protect his family and to prove his power deprivation by the military.
The commanders and commanders at that time read their intentions accurately.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa (which we belong to the Kamo Fullerge group) " were used to describe a strong metaphorical expression of "We are not in political competition unless we are politicians."
The Army told the other military commanders of the region that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the purpose was to remove the "criminals" surrounding him rather than to defeat Mugabe.
In order to discuss coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at that time, South Africans, who were key to this process, refused to intervene, but were repeatedly threatened behind it, clarifying that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military entered the presidency.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and leaders of Africa, it was not possible to achieve it," said the intelligence sources.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to the ban on nuclear weapons in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
[New York Joint] On 26th at the UN headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and Mr. Takeuchi (63) of the second generation of atomic bombings, a granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, spoke to support the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
The new five countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and ratified it in 32 countries and regions.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
The meetings and ratifications were made according to the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons.
Secretary-General Guterres also spoke, and in recent years he expressed strong concern that there was a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is nothing else to eliminate."
China needs strong leadership.
Before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the Chinese State Council said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complex, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified strong leadership, China will go to division and collapse, and will be disastrous for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing issues in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratization movement that occurred in Beijing in 1989.
President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the control of the party since he held the government in late 2012.
Mr. Xi has also directed a military modernization program that threatens the region.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development model, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but merely seek peace.
Some Chinese genes do not invade or control other people.
In modern times, China was bullied from the bullies, and war and confusion left a deep scar with its pain; China would never give the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as the economic downturn and the anti-government movement in Hong Kong in China.
The White Paper states that China never abandons its core interests and does not allow security and sovereignty to be compromised.
"The tariffs that continue to rise with the threat of trade war are no problem-solving," says White Paper in relation to trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with a complete industrial system, complete industrial chain, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"It will never weaken in the trade war."
I am confident that China is facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities, and opening a new world.
The United States should consider China's development calmly, as China has no idea to counter the U.S. and does not want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more likely to stop China's development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move the contradictions of other countries abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director of Kaneko. (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
Yokohama Taka, a famous high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced on 28th that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masami Kaneko (42).
In the future, Oteru Takayama will act as a coach and the director (responsor teacher) will promptly decide.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local newspaper had an appeal to the baseball team.
When the school side heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and the director Kimko admitted some of the rumors.
In addition, based on the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two again confirmed the facts, and generally accepted the facts, and dismissed them on 28 December.
In the summer of Yokohama, Motochika WATANABE (74) directed by Daisuke MATSUSAKA (present-day Naka-day) and others retired.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
He participated in the Kokoen Garden for three consecutive years from the summer of 16 to the summer of 16.
However, when he lost to Sagamihara in the semi-finals in the summer, he lost to Kiriko Gakuen in the semi-finals in autumn and was desperate for the next spring.
The Spice Girls' MelC, the Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage, banned diet topics in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, who had not eaten anything other than fruits and vegetables for many years, admitted that they banned diet at home.
Sportsy spices have long been "excessive exercise" under pressure from members of the global pop group, and have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom stated that his experience was influenced by the child care of his daughter Scarlett, and that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"When Scarlett was 10 years old, he started to care about his appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it is a habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, in front of SNS Taito, Mer told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that "heavy" comments about himself in the media led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself, I took out a certain group of food, I became more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted almost a few years."
The judgment of same-sex marriage, and the opportunity to broaden diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch recognized this case in a lawsuit against whether "real marriage" in accordance with marriage was established between the same sex.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriages, and there is a system in which local governments such as Sapporo City certify the same-sex partnership.
Based on this, the decision was approved by two women.
It is considered the first judicial decision to recognize the legal protection of the same couple and is meaningful.
In the case that the same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Register Act, the lawsuit is filed for damages to the country as a nonconstitution.
To overcome the judgment, I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights of sexual minorities and deepen discussions on the legal system that recognizes the various families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years, and received a certificate of marriage in the United States, but the plaintiffs sought damages to former partners.
The decision was certified as "the reality that is different from marriage between men and women" due to the achievements of the two living together.
It is a revolutionary decision to extend the recognition of marriage with the right to marry in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that makes marriage "only based on the mutual agreement."
Both sexes were "unprecedented at the time of the enactment of the same-sex marriage, and the purpose of denying the same-sex marriage is not understood."
"The Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," but it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits across the country.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women," the problem remained.
While recognizing the actual situation as equal to men and women, it may not be possible to change the rights to protect them.
According to the National Family Trend Survey for married women, about 70 percent of the population's awareness has changed, including the fact that married women should be admitted by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, the law is bound by traditional family statues, and it will take away the rights of those who do not fit.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" that admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriage between the same sexes but also the expansion of legal rights for marriages.
the trial and jury trial of the former athletes prosecuted for rape of multiple women.
A jury trial was held in the trial of former Delaware University baseball players who were accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
The 21-year-old woman stated that she was sexually assaulted after sending her to her home by car.
The two met each other in the dating site Bunbble three weeks later, when Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway has been accused of sexually assaulting six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault the woman.
The defense argued that women's contradictions and differences in memory, and that women were reluctant to have physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure and said, "The next season is the Penantto Era" (Sport News) - Yahoo!
In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final match of the season, and the possibility of his own entry into the CS failed.
If the player wins the remaining three games, they will be eliminated.
At the ceremony after the match, Koichi Ogata (50) apologized, "I am sorry that I could not win the final match, and I could not confirm the ranking.
Some fans were invited to join.
In addition, at the end of the greeting, he said, "I will do my best to take Penantto next season."
At the end of the ceremony, however, when the press was asked about the point, he said, "I'm not finished yet, so I'm going to leave."
[DOSPO] Ota is the first person to transfer to Japan after his transfer, No. 4 and No. 20.
He became "a reward for the seniors."
Four times he was greeted by one lead, and on the left side, he made his 20th home run on the liner.
I reached the number of home runs that I was aiming for, "I stopped receiving this number and tried to do it again, and I became a big one."
His intentions were also firm.
This was the first time a four-point transfer took place.
He said, "I put it in fourth place so I could shake it off."
Oda responded to his expectations: "I felt that I was in the game, and I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the four ideal statues is Abe, a giant who retired from active service in this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads to victory.The 4th of the team is the 4th, and the 4th seniors who have seen the giants were the same."
Among them, "The appearance of Mr. Abe is the most thought: he was a dependable person, and he looked at that back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, the video clearly
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is one of the largest contributors to the opera house, Mercury Key, Luna Park, and the famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of the worst waterways in Australia, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow through the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around the most popular cities in Australia have a lot of suckers, plastic bags, plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing through rainwater into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, the biggest factor in clogging waterways is plastic.
Dr. Catherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the mouths that were significantly altered and contaminated among the coastlines of Japan.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but after that, Sydney Harbour was quite tragic," Dr. Duffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and there is a greater problem that 70 percent of the plastics that flow into the ocean are deposited on the seabed.
"I don't really know what the truth is there if I don't go under the sea level," said David Center Manley, owner and owner Richard Nichols, who will collect about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is under the water surface), I think everyone is really cool.
More than half of what we find is plastic bags.
Plastics are used at least somewhere in the remaining half.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe that all these plastics and garbage are flowing right down the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of Ocean Protect, said that local residents and tourists can also reduce plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the use of plastics, recycles more well, and eventually flows into the sea.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
However, we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing humans.
A new study on plastic and mental health was also presented this month, as part of the activities of the Australian public to be aware of the environmental protection and the reduction of the effects of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of the 546 children aged between 12 and 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
The study also stated that the problem of plastic waste for parents was ranked fourth among concerns and that 93 percent of the 551 parents surveyed were increasingly concerned about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Station was demolished in October | Administrative and Social News | Saga Newspapers
The demolition work began in October, and the chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, Futatako, Karatsu City
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) located in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantlement was two used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991 due to aging.
One smoker splits from top to bottom with a tower crane.
The plan requires a total of 18 months for each decomposition.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
The man in his 60s who runs a restaurant nearby said, "If you look back from the far away and see the chimney, it's like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu."
The former Karatsu Power Plant began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the eastern part of Karatsu Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because the prefecture's Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station are nearby, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

During the workshop, participants discussed the needs of consumers and tried prototypes.
It was also designed to use naggets, but because of the peculiar smell of fish, it adopted mutts.
Masaki Yamaguchi (17) said, "It's a product that can be eaten by people who don't like fish, and I'm happy if you can eat it for many people."
It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell goods.

This time, Maya Takahashi, a free announcer and CBC TV "Chat!," said his master.
my teacher's advice was to save me.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a master beyond his father.
Despite the same industry, my father was an actor and I was an announcer.
It is different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important as a working person.
I finally became an announcer of the TV station by 120% of my efforts, but when I was struck by being said to be a cone or a bosyk, my father said, "I thought it was a cone, but I didn't think it was.
After that, when I joined the company in the second and third years, when I was only working "Anyone with an empty woman is good," and when I wasn't motivated because I didn't want to work around and my heart was rotting, "I asked everyone to do good work, but I was glad that I was in charge of Mama.Next, I decided to appoint Mama."
i learned naturally from my father's performance.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but in fact, since I joined the TV station, I have been in touch with the news all the time with the narration of BS and news shows.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript.
When I read the news, I feel that I'm important and sensed.
It has been cultivated by watching his father's stage, film, television, and period drama in his childhood.
In other words, I think that my father thanks to the various experiences of my childhood.

Workshops in Kagamihara
Workshops on the role and effect of five instruments played in the dance were introduced on the 26th.
The group dance workshop (hosted by the Prefectural Board of Education and Education Agency) was held at Kagamihara Junior High School on 26th.
All students attended the event and learned about the 300-year history and birth of dance, as well as the acoustic effects and utilization of musical instruments played.
In the workshop, members of the OB Association of the Ryukyu Performing Arts Department of the Prefectural University of Arts and Sciences introduced the role of each instrument in dance while playing three lines, koto, drums, and kokyu.
The host was from Miyakojima City, and Mr. Kawamakata of the OB Association, who introduced the charm of dance.
In this workshop, I learned about the three components of dance (music, chanting, Ryukyu dance) and how five kinds of instruments are represented in dance.
As for the three lines, it was explained that it was an element of the movement and emotional expression of the characters along with the songs, and that Hukyu pulled out of the song and the melody of the three lines while playing.
In the latter half, the students actually touched the instrument and experienced the sound of the instrument, and felt the appeal as an instrument.
This initiative has been implemented with the aim of becoming familiar with Ryukyu classical music through musical instruments, and to attract many students interested in "gumi-dori" and this is the first time in Miyako.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Looking back on the past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
(18)
The final event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is WRC that will revive in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which Formula One (F1) and World Endurance Championships are held.
Since 1973, it has been the world's highest rally championship with a history and tradition, and it is said to be the toughest car competition to run fast on various road surfaces such as gravel and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title since 1999 and became a big topic.
This time, the Japan Round Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsports Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.) and Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), both governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, speak as follows.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship 2020 to be held in Japan, and we will work with stakeholders to achieve the success of the 2020 Autumn Games in cooperation with them so that we can make a big appeal to the world as the center of representative motorsports.
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you soon."
Mr. Shoo Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation)
"I am very pleased to be able to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Motorsport Promotion, commented on the Japanese round.

The main venue is "Love Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is it the key to cancer treatment?
Tusmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells were camouflaged.
The researchers found that the same process occurred in Tasmania and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will bring new ways to treat cancer patients.
What is common between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
The team, including researchers at the Peter McCall Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing a deadly face tumor that threatens the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
In this study, we found that some cancer cells in humans and bags would no longer respond to markers because they used a series of proteins called PRC2 to cam fullage.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and mellkel cells.
"The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy," said Mark Doson, a researcher at Peter McClum.
Reuse conventional therapies, revitalizing markers, i.e. proteins known as MHC, may enable the immune system to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Doson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And treatment may be much better.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat the face-to-face tumor of Tasmanian devils, where cancer cells escape detection.
"Unfortunately, the same process happens at all (to humans and Tasmanian devil cancers)," Professor Doson said.
"It was very difficult to treat Tusmaniadeville tumor.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may be useful to control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting polar stars.
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system covering the current understanding of planetary formation by orbiting a giant Jupiter-shaped planet around a small star called Red dwarf, 30 light-years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of a giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting a red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the size of stars and planets is not large, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, led by this research published in Science.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet takes about 204 days to explore the elliptical orbit around the star.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only quite small than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, and only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I'm red."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet could have been released from its star system in the past, explaining the elliptic orbit of the Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gases and dust that generate stars orbiting themselves.
The most powerful planetary formation model, known as the "core integrated" model, generates objects from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes atmospheric by the attraction of the egg produced by the planet.
This rare planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature might have been lower."
As the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses may grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee and a stimulant bean dip were eaten by his colleagues and prosecuted.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating dipping beans with awakening agents to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Ani Medina Hernández (38) was accused of the transfer of methane fetamine, a B-grade felony, and the use of regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to the estimate of the oath issued by OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked him to give him a little taste because Medina Hernández saw the making of beans dip.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane fetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach became worse and her legs were fluffy.
According to Albany Demokrat Herald, a local hospital where women went was judged to have had methane phetamine mixed in soy dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández had told the victim's food that he had "puted drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane fetamine into a soy dip.
According to the Oregon Live article, the surveillance video that was seized by Deli shows that Medina Hernández turned back to the camera and was stuck behind the microwave, but something was taken out of the brager.
It is said that he was standing up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put a soy dip in a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff has stated that there are no customers who have been contaminated at present.
Medina Hernández was jailed in Marion County instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of assault, robbery, suffrage, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

5 Medical institutions in Saga Prefecture | Administrative and Social News | Saga Newspapers
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare needed reorganisation and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced their hospital name on 26th.
The population of 13 medical institutions in the prefecture is 38 and 5%, which is the tenth highest in the country, and three have already been integrated and transferred.
The official name of the hospital in the prefecture was Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Midorimoto-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Citizen Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Taramachi Tatara Hospital in Fujitsu County.

Trump Hotel owner's suitability also holds a license to sell liquor.
Washington (AP) - The Washington Alcohol and Beverage Board of Directors in Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the local Trump International Hotel's license to sell liquor because of the question of the owner's suitability.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three members, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to cancel the right to provide alcohol at the hotel is based on the state law that requires the applicant to obtain a license to sell alcohol.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year included repeated deceptions against President Trump's assault and violating state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time that the license was renewed.

In May 2019, a set-up bee was started on the grounds of the UK's Bentley Crew Plant, and in September of the same year, honey was harvested.
More than 100 bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley become a beekeeper at the factory site where cars were assembled?
I want to taste this!
Bentley's honey is here (11)
Peter Bosch, director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant in the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers watched the scene from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains where nectars are gathering various flowers.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Through the Crew Plant and the Company's business, Bentley has conducted a wide range of activities as much as possible as possible to the top of a sustainable luxury car manufacturer.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of betray honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to fulfill our role." In May 2019, 12 million bees of bees, FlyingBees, started.
In September of the same year, over a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was sprinkled with a centrifugal separator and filtered the fallen honey.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen as Bentley's signature.
The label design was designed by Louise McCarlum, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only served by the staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to Fennerty, which is compatible with honey, I would like to enjoy afternoon tea together with the "FiveBees" beets in Scorn and others.
The newspaper, the Cleveland Police, is said to be the worst in the United Kingdom in a violent report.
The police, who continued the scandal, were accused of being the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and rated it inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continued to be "a serious deterioration," says Phil Gomley.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, efforts to prevent crimes, arrest suspects and protect socially vulnerable persons were unsuccessful.
Phil Gomley of the Police Department said, "It has been a long time since our last investigation."
The police chief Mike Vill resigned in January less than a year before his inauguration, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for multiple charges of unpublished.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Commission for the Investigation of illegal acts for his colleagues to act sexually.
He resigned from the police.
The Conservative mayor of Teas Valley Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Interior intervenes."
The police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Bar was a "criminal" and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what will happen next.
Currently, we believe that we are involved in a cover-up case, and it may take some time to investigate."
"We're going to do what we've started to do, based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," said Pelosi.
This week's White House record revealed that Trump asked the President of Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Mr. Bar to cooperate with his own personal advisor, Rudy Juliani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine over a week prior to formal inquiries on Thursday.
The Ministry of Justice, accused of contacting information agencies and others, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not extend to the investigation of violations of political funds.
In response to the question of whether Burr should testify, Pelosi stated on Friday that he would decide who the Special Committee of Intelligence will witness.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was always included," Pelosi said, and he touched on Trump's name for the Secretary of Justice on the telephone talks in July with the President of Ukraine.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be approached by the judge regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" when Trump attacked the whistler on Thursday, claiming that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
President's statement is too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that the whistleblower plays an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to the whistleblower is a significant loss of the sum of the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about the suspicions that he had tried to pressure foreign leaders for political benefit.
The call content is included in the accusations released on Thursday, and the whistleblower claims that Trump abused his job to seek intervention in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that the White House advisors instructed officials to remove calls from the cabinet-level computer system and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Bentek, driving ban on speed violations
The Premier League star, Christian Bentek, who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.
The 28-year-old forward at Crystal Palace allowed her to drive her own Bentley on January 20 to drive 50 miles per hour at a speed limit of A3 in Richmond, southwest London.
The Belgians then took a speed control camera in Patney, southwest London, where they ran 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Benteke, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Lavender Hill Court of Justice this morning.
In early July, Bentek pleaded guilty of these two violations under a single trial procedure to appeal to the judgment of light crimes.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the review committee
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasccus, expressed concern about the composition of the next GFA election review committee.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davies and expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA sports, Mr. Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the outcome of the judging process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should be composed of a fair and neutral member from outside of the previous interest, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Palmer about 10% compensation.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if the Olympic Committee member Fred Papoé attended the committee, the relationship between the club and the chairman would result in a conflict of interest, while Palmer suggested that the committee would be biased and unfair.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after the inauguration of the ceremony held at the GFA Akra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19.
Mr. Frank Davis, Chairman of Corporate Governance Consultants, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, lawyer, and Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Akpocavi, a sports director and lawyer.
The survey of the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage by the state to raise the minimum wage.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of plans was around 50% for new graduates and mid-term employees, and 30% for non-regular employees.
The number of companies that answered "approved" to raise the hourly salary to 1,000 yen was 100 percent, construction (70 and 6 percent) and wholesale (61 and 7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (51-90%) and service industries (60 and 9 percent), including food and beverage, lodging, and transportation.
"There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it will increase labor costs," said the representative at the meeting.
The average amount of money was 895 yen (from 4 October to 829 yen in Fukui Prefecture).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, the hiring of new graduates was 61/3 percent, the hiring of new employees was 54-5 percent, and the non-regular employment was 15-4%.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of plans was 44, 7 percent, 50 and 3 percent, and nonregulars remained 31 and 1%.
In particular, transportation (particularly 13 and 3 percent of new graduates, 37 and 5 percent) and construction (24, 1 percent of new graduates, 38 and 1 percent) were struggling.
A total of 86 and 4% had challenges in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the company's reputation was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the adoption of new graduates (in three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There were opinions to support students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-sector and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied, "It is already accepted."
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total acceptance attitude was expressed.

The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) answered.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiplic said, "We are here to show you now," when Wales comes to the World Cup Tenoyama and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Walladés, it will become the hottest candidate in Pool D, and perhaps the semi-finals against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game win against Wales was the 14th victory, Tiplic and his team would be the 8th straight line against England.
"It's natural, I want to challenge both teams and win at the top of the group."
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win in the autumn of last year.
I think Australia will be blamed for returning the loan, but until I try to win it again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I came here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales had only one win in the previous World Cup, both Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the total score for the 3rd Southern Hemisphere heavyweight team was only 7 out of 41.
Wales finished 13th in the November Test Match Australia match last year, but Tiprick included several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
He said, "It's hard to answer.
Indeed, the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it would be impossible to win.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so I seemed to have been much closer to the score than actually."
To win Wales, the key is the combination of Australia, which is worshiped as Back Law, Michael Hopper and David Pocock, and the Breakdown Battle with Tiplic.
Up to now, Tiplic has played 67 international matches, and has played several matches and two players in the past.
"They are definitely the world level backs player," he says.
When you fight against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you're going to face a tough game.
They are always at the highest level in the world.
I am fully aware of what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in defensive battles, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs.
I want to increase myself by fighting against the world's best players rather than fighting against the strong backro.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against them, you have to keep yourself up.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important match for us.
momentum is important.
If you continue to build a good performance, you will be able to play a game that will not lose on the momentum.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings '90 percent of the gala', would it really be a gift from comedians?
A series of problems with Yoshimoto Kogyo, which triggered the dark business of antisocial forces, have been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto, at the meeting on July 22, said that the average "5:5-6:4" is that the company does not have any talent at 9.
If the ratio of "9:1" was 90 percent for Yoshimoto, the views of investors who were deemed to have been gifted from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and taxed, flowed on Twitter.
If the Gala deal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was asked by Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not the subject of gift tax in the first place.
If the amount of work for 100 million yen was "9:1," Yoshimoto Kogyo will benefit 90 million yen from sales of 100 million yen and cost of 100,000 yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you're wondering about allocation, you don't argue that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should have originally received.
And I think the amount I received is declared as sales.
If the person who gave the gift does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if he was an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g. buying and selling real estate) away from the original market for tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as this time, third parties will not be able to decide on how much tax appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think that one yen payment bill is a poison.
[Interview Cooperation Tax Rishi] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working as a bank, after graduating from university, he registered a tax accountant (a book, financial statements, corporate tax law, income tax law, inheritance tax law) in 2008.
University lecturers, seminars, and writing work are broad.
It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for beginners.
the white house, the impeachment.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and detailed officials in this issue explained that there was little plan to deal with the emerging reality this week.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have increased concerns, anxiety, and concerns about the possibility that the appeal of the whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't know what it is."
The White House officials were joking about the fact that there were no obvious plans for this situation, and the fact that the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far could not apply was so serious that they were not convinced how to proceed.
Another person familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state with a great shock" because the President's response to this impeachment would increase the likelihood of being "punished."
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the President is expected to be raised every day, and some close associates of the President are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable actions and concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means are spurred by concerns about President and Politics in the environment of election year.
Trump faced the greatest threat ever before in his term of office, and revived his strategy that he judged effective during the Russian investigation by Robert Morler, and changed his hands to attack or defend himself.
Trump tried to lighten the request of the President of Ukraine to cooperate with the investigation of political enemies, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and the presidential candidate Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured Morale's trials, but this time they began to feel the difference.
Although he is a brand president, he seemed to be attending the press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed a question about the alleged Russian investigation, but did not seem to have a mind to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers have been aware of the fact that President Trump, Vladimir Zellensky, and the fact that he did not have direct information on the call with the President of Ukraine, which has become controversial, claim that it is a fact that undermines the credibility of the whistleblower and are convinced that damage can be reduced.
Furthermore, it often happens when the President is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, Republican strategic families, close to the White House, point out that the basic support rate of the President is already very high and the effect of impeaching new supporters is not much.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those who argue that impeachment could help the President did not fully understand how much the response of the President would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to the officials who explained the plan, this initiative is still in the early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the strategic decision room will be implemented in the form.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have a clear leader who can organize public relations in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum of the publication and publication of critical internal accusations on Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible, such as the statement that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munshins would not publish a note on Trump's call with the President of Ukraine after 48 hours.
According to the person involved in this case, the person who could be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump, and Corrie Luwanduski, who served as the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwanduski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never talked with the president or a close associate about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Scorp, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Crow replied, "The problem is properly handled."
Emmet Frad, who was engaged in impeachment of Clinton and led the White House until the end of the Mollah investigation, left Pat Ciporon, the current White House legal adviser, with little experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience of impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy is generally recognized that the parties are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but must be organized and capable of leading the efforts and political struggle that all have done so.

I am worried that I should continue my relationship with my boyfriend in a distant love.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I have work and my family, but his working place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from distant love is a minority.
Nikkei dors Editorial Department (-) C is in a long distance relationship with a boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested in distance and the two become stronger," but in the first place, does it work well?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa The survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered.
Since love is done using five senses, it is originally a relationship with the other person (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (artificial), smelling (or smelling), kissing (taste).
However, in the case of distant love, there are cases where you can hear voices by phone.
It may be difficult to keep in touch with the auditory situation.
There is also a cost issue.
If you go to an opponent's house, the body is a factor, even though it is a holiday to heal the fatigue of your work.
When I return, I feel comfortable.
Is that the only thing that can be separated when it comes to a distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure without having to meet frequently or a couple whose time is determined beforehand.
You'll be engaged one year later or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you don't see a future landing point.

Debbie Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Senator Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems to be unable to bear the idea of President Donald Trump being investigated.
On Thursday, in a comment to defend the President, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Congressman Nunes, a Republican executive of the House Information Special Committee, filed an appeal in the opening statement of the hearing about the internal charges Trump requested to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The Congress condemned the Democratic Party to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians who seemed to be Ukrainians to obtain Trump's nude photographs."
It is natural that everyone asks why the Democratic Party is so exciting to impeach the President, and that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes ended, HuffPost's senior political correspondent Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democrats were trying to find the truth.
The only response to this was the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, Jim Hems, but many other members questioned whether the answer was a red naked truth.
Mediate Dotcom speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that were written in steel documents that were controversial.
It is a notorious report by former intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected by Trump in a hotel in Moscow looking at the urination of prostitutes.

Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services said, "We will create new financial services to solve the problems of the younger generation who need to live in a variety of issues such as pensions and low interest rates," adding that "For example, I would like to provide services that are equally useful for those who were alien to finance and those who were not able to benefit from the current system."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origami ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get timely information.
In addition, he explained that by deploying not only the Origami app but also on partner companies' apps, it would be possible to use the Origami app without having it.

After being devoted to silence, Messse-ji was introduced by Mr. Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the Korea Arts Exchange Association and the Chuchu Institute of International Studies.
the potential to reduce emissions by renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only aircraft to fly in the sky and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables regenerative biofuels to be used as jet fuels.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, launched the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil and fat, livestock rendering, and canola oil from restaurants.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used for production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude oil-based fuels, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma that doesn't matter," says Bresler.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as a biofuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try the reactor to change chemical reactions a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someone will impose carbon taxes in the future."
I would like to prepare an alternative to the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmondton's Waste Management Center, and recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin as a support to build 2,500 million production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million litres of biofuel per year.
Dr. Bresler stated that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher in terms of fuel transport and production.
"As a technology store," says Bresler.
My job is to create an option so that you can make multiple choices in parallel with the decisions that are explained.

Boris Johnson warns that if Brexit is over, the British will face riots like Los Angeles.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a danger that "a violent riot by the people" would occur in this country.
The Prime Minister's officials warned that Britain would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that he "nearing anger" was necessary for political words exchanged with intense speech, but insisted that he would not use the term "default."
Despite the appeal of the prime minister to regain his calmness, one minister said to the Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Yellow Best Movement or the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country just because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and a few populists who use dirty hands to drive people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when the jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to a verdict of innocence.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstrators Gire Joan, who wore the yellow best, have caused confusion and destruction in the city of Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed to Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives, stating that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, the 10 million people would be dissatisfied."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time until tens of thousands of people go through the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first result, there would be a danger that "a violent riot by the people" would occur in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing the House of Representatives rebellion, seeking to lower the demands for EU withdrawal and instead to hit the EU with compromises.

Pakistani social media celebrity brother, he was sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed and the memory of the incident fades.
The women's rights activist, Farzana Bali, the founder of the first gender department at the University of Pakistan, said, "It took more than three years to solve even the Burrought case, which is attracting attention.
Although human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "elebrated murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the actual number of honorable homicides is much more than that, but it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorable homicides occurring around the world each year are occupied by Pakistan.
Countermeasures against pork cholera 1.3 billion yen To add to the September correction plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo! News
It was reported that the prefectural government would add a total of 14.8 million yen to the supplementary budget plan in September, with a total cost of $13.6 million for the emergency prevention project of pig cholera and 1,200 million yen for the decision-making expenses required for the acquisition of land for the elevated JR Numazu Station.
It is proposed to the 27th prefectural assembly.

Floods and disruptions caused by monsoons in many areas
The Monsoon season in India is about a month long, with unprecedented rainfall that killed buildings and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month has increased by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, the monsoon will weaken during the most late decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune in the western part of India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays caused the collapse of the building to be disastrous.
The houses were flooded, and the residents took water to their knees to cross the street, usually seen only at the peak of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Rakna and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rain.
In the northern part of Utttarkand, heavy rains caused damage to houses.
Monsoon's arrival was too late.
Due to lack of water in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
For farmers, prolonged monsoons are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmhouse in Bimtal, Uttarakand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but vegetables rot in rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pens) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees (about 1 pound).
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dašera on 8 October, and the Hindus set up Ravana, an evil smiling figure of a beard that appears in the huge comic book-style doll, epic "Lamaryana."
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, it may be Lavana to laugh at the end.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides and increased risk of heart disease and heart attack
The latest research shows that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This is the result of a survey of Japanese-American kloops in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from over 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kakitani Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research could not be applied to women and other races, as only Japanese American males.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study showed the greatest impact within 10 years after exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure to pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important."
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to aging and hiding possible relationships between pesticides and mental disorders in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Serensky: Poroshenko intervention in Trump's telephone talks
The impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump were made, and the Washington political issue was a dramatic week.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners Vladimir Zellensky.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump phone issue so far, and is the widespread impact of Zerensky?
At the beginning of the telephone talks, Trump said that the U.S. is more convenient to Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the fact that Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders were focusing on a more concrete proposal.
Zerensky's response to Trump's objection to 100% rather than 1000 percent is controversial.
Zerensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially opposition parties in Ukraine, argued on social media.
The former President of Ukraine, Petro Poloshenko, posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he thanked the EU for its assistance including Russian sanctions and economic assistance in the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Voyticica, said, "Is it possible to negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scolded military aid and asked Zelensky to investigate two rather than one, the first, against Joe Biden's son Hunter, the second, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic e-mail intrusion during the 2016 election, and the investigation of the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee.
It is uncertain whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
"I'm grateful to those who helped me with the announcement of the call record."
Zelensky will meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana and the International Civil Aviation Organization won two awards.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The award was awarded to Ghana for the provisional 89.89% of its effective implementation rate and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019.
The safety award was approved by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding safety in airports and their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of the support of the ICAO Zero Campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications and 17 certifications were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Minister of Aeronautics Joseph Cofiada Ghana, Director of Civil Aviation Simon Alloti Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aico Otou to Canada, and Director of Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICA) Ormiwa Bennard Aliu emphasized the need to maintain aviation safety in the participating countries.
"It is important to remain aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also stated that the award was a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the efforts and patience of the sector.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy, as "airs are likely to change our lives dramatically."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump and Peter Gayno appointed FEMA Supreme Court: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Secretary of State for Emergency Management Peter Gayno smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA budget bill at the National Security Council at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gayno as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, deputy director of FEMA, was in the position of deputy director of government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
Since March, when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned, the office had been absent from the Senate.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, stated that Long had illegally used government-owned cars to commute to work between Washington and his home, Noor Caroline.
Mr. Jeffrey Baiard, one of the other recommended, brought up doubts that he was drunk in alcohol and involved in the riots, and was excluded from the selection at the beginning of the month after the examination.
Mr. Gayno's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will be approved.
Before taking office as Deputy Secretary of FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had served at the Emergency Management Bureau in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down the illegal marijuana baying business in San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of botan honey oil (rich cannabis oil) was found at an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that investigators also found equipment packed with bayp cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
Captain Cano said that he had previously been engaged in drug investigations and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used for Bayp products.
"Just static electricity from clothes can fire, and because it is concentrated, it will cause not only fires but also explosions," said Lieutenant Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions and fires one after another.
The risk management team was summoned to the vacant office to seize illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately disclosed.
The investigator said that he received an anonymous information and led to an investigation warrant on the site that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still pursuing who the illegal Beip campaign is.
The police said that the office was empty and that Zhang himself had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that, in particular, the recent news related to the dangers of bating, would like to tend to be illegal bating products and not go out again.
Captain Cano said, "It's really a real thing or something you don't know about."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our communities and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert there was a 6-strong earthquake!
Evacuation training in Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
As the earthquake occurred during the concert, a practical evacuation drill was conducted at the hall in Miyazaki City.
This training is held every year.
It is assumed that a six-strong earthquake occurred along the way of the song.
Approximately 300 people attended the training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff.

Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was woven with silver foil threads made of the finest camlet silk, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Herstic Royal Palace dress collection curator, Ellie Lynn, has decided to be one.
This fading piece of cloth, which was hung on the wall of a small church in one countryside, was placed there 100 years ago, and is thought to be part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this luxurious cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Bactton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited at the Hampton Court Palace next month, near exactly that room where the Queen of Tudor could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one dress left in the 16th century was found in the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence that Elizabeth passed the dress through the sleeves, the study of the three years increased the confidence of the expert that the dress was not part of the royal possession.
One of the most expensive textiles of the royal family, "the cloth with silver thread," was prepared by law only for senior members of the royal family, but the quality of the plant and flower embroidered also suggests that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later was a noble person.
At the time the dress was made, it seems that the price was equivalent to one house in the Tudor style.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rivals wearing such luxurious clothing could not endure.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues.
When I saw the cloth, I was always happy to say, "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one of the dresses used as an altarpiece of the St. Face Church of Bactton, cut off, and unmarked, seems unexpected but not so.
Bactton is a village of Brunswick Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and is said to have long been associated with Parley.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
More than 1000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altarpiece cloth will be exhibited next to Elizabeth, one of the most admired contemporary paintings leased by Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, and the preservation work was done almost here, and the work led by Ricky Thompson said, "If you are dealing with historical fabrics, you will feel really respect for the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered embroidery on the front and back, you will be very respectful to those who made it.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held from October 12 at Hampton Court Palace.
"The scope of the request has been searched and found" A week after the missing female child, the Self-Defense Force withdraws and the volunteer male is missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It's a week since the first year of elementary school girls are missing in a campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces, which still had no clues, closed the search and withdrew on 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared, and the search for the 28th day began at 6 am.
However, the village requested that the Self-Defense Forces withdraw from the SDF as "the scope of the request has been searched."
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Force has invested 650 people, mainly on the mountain slopes and the dangerous places such as Sawa.
On the 27th, there was no way to know the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who participated in the search by volunteers.
The police and fire department will continue to search from 6:30 am on 29th.
The first oral dialect, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
As a result of the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation because the value of one vote is 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared with the smallest number of voters per member in Fukui Prefecture in July.
In the first oral statement on the 27th, held at the Fukuoka High Court Miyazaki Branch, the plaintiff argued that "the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional."
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the Defendant asked for a rejection of the bill as "not even though it was in a significant inequalities that could cause the issue of constitutionality."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

On the night of 28th, the unmanned spacecraft "Konotori" No. 8 (JAXA), carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) carrying about 400 kilometers of altitude, arrived near the station, while astronauts during their stay operated the robot arm.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced with the control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, the speed difference is eliminated and the distance is about 10 meters.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters long is a flow that grabs the supply machine.
There are about 5 tons of supplies.
After being attached to the station, the flight attendants carry the luggage.
one third of the drugs in the united states
Shortly after the sunrise of Chicago West Side, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
Nearly 800 people died in Chicago last year in excess of drugs.
McNight said that the drug "probably 90%" was brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican narcotics king named El Mencio Servantes.
The Mexican agent Matthew Donahew DEA said, "Mencho is DEA and indeed the top priority of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's winnings reach $1 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were violent.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva, is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, Cartel sold "a large amount of cocaine, methane fetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin."
El Mencho's head received a $1 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he had actually owned his own special mobility unit.
From the death of six Mexican helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders have been occurring due to drug trafficking.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican narcotics are toxic and must be used in protective clothing.
At the production base, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the solder.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahew said, Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that virtually capture the lives of innocent women and children.
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said that it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news release, PS4 game was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent state of play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to Last of As.
Some of the video footage of this new action game was also presented to fans.
A few days after the Last of As2 news, further details were announced.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in many ways.
The last of the two parts, which had never been seen since the PSwan era, were released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Notydog Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous work, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
In this way, it was necessary to talk about the story of many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how much this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game did not enter a single blue ray, and it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it is not possible to ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic notic dogs.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 limited to PS4, you will know more.
Those who have PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered with PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently released the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like Last of As Rimasterd and want to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game including popular character Erie backpacks and bracelet replicas, and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Hidekaru" The Council attempts Residents wish to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th day of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased, traffic sales started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council, a local resident.
In an attempt by December, wagons with daily necessities, seasonings, and food ran through Susomachikai and Hanpomachikai on the first day.
There were also products that were sold more than expected and quickly supplemented, and the residents asked for a continuation of "helping" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, a total of vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiro gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Suso-chokai, the population was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuji of the Council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with his husband's driving, expressed his expectation that "the price is cheap and convenient.I do not know when my father can drive, and I want to continue."
Users also received orders such as "I want you to have a coffee that you don't have canned coffee, but you don't want to do it yourself."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to save "shop weak."
By December, the 20-machi-kai in the island will be around once a month.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he decided to add about $1 billion to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm benefits have been greatly reviewed to simplify.
In addition, approximately 34,000 million dollars will be allocated to the drought-affected community support organization and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a subsidy program for drought-related areas, each of the 13 municipalities will be able to provide up to $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion in budget for drought support.
Ronald Lee Haskell: charges of murder of a former wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014, killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of his five children.
The authorities said that on July 9, 2014, Haskell was pushed into the residence of Stay and questioned the whereabouts of his wife Melanie Haskel.
Melanie was absent, but she had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old, nine and seven-year-old daughters died.
Only one person in his family, the only one who was 15 years old at that time, Cashy Stay, died.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but it recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed the innocence of Ronald Lee Haskell's heart loss.
The jury was dismissed until the day of the month.
"If you choose to disappoint us, you will never forgive us."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook her voice with anger resonated with the leaders of each country.
Global warming is becoming more serious.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City, Swedish 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg spoke to strengthen the measures.
He helped to spread the school strike all over the world, including boycotting classes and sitting in front of Congress.
Young people, who raised anxiety and anxiety, protested all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people participated in the event.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will start in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century, to less than twice the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution, if possible, to 1-5.
All participating countries, regardless of the distinction between developed countries and developing countries, take measures to be taken.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to be associated with global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is often followed in various places.
In order to increase global warming at a faster pace, one-step efforts are required.
At the summit, which was realized by the call of Secretary General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal to virtually zero by 50.
Other 70 countries raised their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which expressed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not explicitly express their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers became apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
The Minister of Environment, Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's efforts at the environmental-related meeting, said that he should work on fun, cool and sexy issues at the meeting.
The appeal does not deny, but is too poor compared to the appeal of the girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wounds that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "replacement of issues" that the person counters.
There is no longer a grace to combat global warming, and the international community must respond to a common crisis in humanity.
We can't expect sufficient effectiveness for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act without taking the future.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The U.S. Army's research results led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such internet may enable us to secure military security, measure and measure time functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the U.S. Army Research Institute's Distributed Quantum Information Center, which is funded and operated by the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between matter and light - 50 km away using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state and one is measured, even if the other quantum bits are physically far from the other, the measurement results are affected by the other.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Dr. Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and leading researcher at Insbruck University, who announced the results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network of physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entanglement is essential to the formation of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale distributed engagement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and at the same time excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with fiber optic cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed into fiber optic cables," says Rañon.
The team first sent the light particles through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, which is the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a fiber optic cable 50 kilometers long.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-range transition of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, resulting in an entangled network of long-range atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army from terms of precise positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications."
