Croatia is planning nuclear treatment facilities, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and protested the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a beautiful natural river near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in the town of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the site of the barracks in Turkovska Gola, and vow to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote "Don't take a healthy future" and "We need to stop it," said the nuclear waste disposal facility could threaten the lives of about 250,000 residents in the Una and surrounding areas.
We must oppose it.
The head of the municipality of Novi Grad, Miloslav Draka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided to build its own storage facility or to pay for the cost of waste in Croatia that Slovenia would be treated at newly constructed facilities.
Croatia's Minister of Environment and Energy, Tomislav Chorich, told the announcer that Croatia has problems in the disposal of public facilities waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents in the country claimed that Croatia would seek another construction site on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket be the perfect place for Turkovska Gola?"
Don't allow us to hurt our self-esteem!

The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are sick.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is the story of Patton Hobert, who aims to become President of the United States, but it is the first step to become the student council president of his high school.
It was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, with appearances by Gwinnes Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness where parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, despite the fact that humans under their protection are not seriously ill.
There are various types of pathology, but there are also munchhausen syndromes that are false that they are sick.
However, the representative Münchhausen syndrome is clearly false that others under their protection are ill.
It is also known as FII, counterfeiting or induced disease, and is a type of child abuse.
Although rare symptoms, parents usually exaggerated symptoms or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what is the sign of the proxy Munchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following issues as a precaution.
The child is healthy, but if he is sick, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as rough or false.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing diabetes.
Overdose medications and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How general is Münchhausen syndrome?
Because many cases are not reported, it is hard to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that 89 cases of 100,000 people had occurred over two years.
what should we do if we suspect a child's damage?

Nigeria: police force investigation into caduna schools and rescue 300 children
The Kaduna Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
Police said that the children were placed in a humanitarian environment, but the school denied this claim.
The residents who call themselves the school pastor said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
The parents came to deliver their meals every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were doing.
It was very surprising that the police came and evacuated the children, and after all the food delivered by parents left, the school closed.
There are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair treatment."
He adds that Abdullahman, head of the former Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Savo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children had a scar on their back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

The women's tennis Wuhan Open (Chinese: Wuhan, hard, WTA Premier 5) took place on the 27th and the singles semifinals were held on the 27th.
[20 years old sabarrenka to the top 10]
Last year, Savarenka, the champion of the tournament, gained points with a probability of 75 percent when the first service was available.
He broke three world-class barty service games with eight double faults and won the game in an hour and 43 minutes.
The Women's Professional Tennis Association WTA publishes comments on the official website of Savarenka.
"Of course, I'm glad to come to the final, and it was a very tough game, and today I'm not supposed to be a great level of play, but I'm glad I could find a thread to win."
"I think this victory has a lot of meaning to me, and it's better than last year, and last year it was the first Premier final, the title, and this year it's really tough season, and I feel I can enjoy it back to this level."

Central Coast's "Super Evil Undo" girl raped by camouflage, and an order to confront the victim in court.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage gilly suit with leaves caught a 12-year-old girl from behind at a school in Central Coast, Kentucky.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to wood and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges, including this assault and grooming against another 11-year-old girl, and sexual abuse.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on a small road and witnessed a man armed with a large tree branches and knife suddenly coming out of the bush.
When a girl asks, "Don't stop, stop, stop."
The man said to the girl, "Don't speak loud.
If you hear a loud voice, you won't be able to see it hurt."
The man had a cutlery on his right hand and the girl's hands tied in the cable tie, then hit the tree and abused for nearly an hour.
When a man broke the cable, the girl ran into a school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace at 9:30 a.m., although he had several phone calls and mails from his colleagues.
The man stood out in the clothes of mud, grass, trees, etc., and was involved in street violence, and insisted that the driver had been chasing the bush, and that he had been around by hand.
The man's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development, based on public interests, warned IT representatives
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats and investors that if there was no ethical assessment of public interest on Friday, artificial intelligence development competition and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference, where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met.
In this conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference proved to be the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and dangers in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increased machine work, and at the same time, examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand, and responses by social media companies during the atrocities were examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines were released from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances are causing increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, then unfortunately, we're going to go back to a state of barbarism based on the theory of Qiang people.
According to the organizers of the conference, they would like to take advantage of the expertise of the participants in this meeting and find the talent to be a future adviser to the Catholic Church on high-tech fields.
Nagano Appliance Directed by G Abe!
thank you, master.
Hiroshima and Nagano Kuyoshinote (34) started their career in the mid-day battle (Mazda) on the 27th.
The first two-and-a-half-death hit was "September" by Earth Wind & Fire on the appearance of giant Abe who announced his retirement this season.
The result was a mid-fly with liner characteristics, but from a sensitive fan who noticed Nagano's stylish surprise production, applause arose.
For Nagano, Abe became a senior official after becoming a professional.
She also gave a message to the Tokyo Dome, which was held by the giant DeNA, who became a memorial match for Abe's retirement.
Real Madrid's loan, player Martin Woodegor, and fan excitement with a voice assist.
Martin Woodegor showed a surprise support for Michel Oyalusabar.
Real Madrid won the Ossana at 2-0, renewing the undefeated record in the domestic season, and the top of the La Liga rankings.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure due to the intense open battle and the unconstitutional disagreement with Welsh star Gareth Bayle.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, the pressure seemed to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Arabes, and was surprised by Michel Oyalusaval's preemption, and Real Socieda won 3-0.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite pass through the inner side of another two players to Oyalusabal to determine the goal.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third penalty spot of the stunning Oyalusabar, he secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before Alabeth's Midfiller and Manu Garcia left for 5 minutes before the end.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated this territory.
Anna Hazale, the name of Sharad Powerle was surprised by the fraudulent financing of the cooperative bank in Maharashtra.
Anna Hazale said, "When I contacted this lawsuit, the name of Sharad Powerle was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the name of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Bureau (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerll and his nephew, Deputy Minister of State Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Financial Cleaning Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, charged with the name of former staff of the former chairman of the Bank, Amit Power and 70 co-operative banks.
When he came to contact the lawsuit, his name was nowhere.
Anna Hazale said on Thursday that they only know how Sharad's name emerged and who mentioned it.
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Power, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerr denied any misconduct and claimed that it had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of filing a lawsuit just weeks before the Maharashtra parliamentary election on October 21.
The former coalition minister clearly pointed to the government led by the Indian People's Party and declared that he would not surrender before the "kingdom" of Delhi.
NCP referred to the action by the Executive Bureau as a formality.

The company agreed to pay $30 million for settlement in the case that investors did not disclose information about the investigation of the U.S. Department of Justice on the presence of excessive claims over epipens on Medicaid.
On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had classified epipen as "Generic" in the Medicadian drug rebate program.

Stop the accident!
Four Preliminary Prevention Devices - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by a driver's mistake.
In particular, there is an increasing trend in accidents caused by brake and accelerator steps by elderly drivers.
Especially when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes a panic, and the accelerator continues to follow the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with a safety driver support function to cover such driving errors, but there is also a rearing device that can be attached to an unattended car.
After-sale parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapids and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what features each have.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and the pedal interval is narrow.
[e-ACCEL ALARRM] The "e-ACCEL ALARRM" developed by Pivot to inform you of the pedal mistake from a new perspective.
The pedal's step-by-step mistake is to be avoided by the alarm sound.
The mechanism occurs " alarm sound" when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake with the brake at stop or slow driving.
By reacting to the sound and prompting the accelerator to return, and quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping, it avoids rapid acceleration.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf to hear.
It is attached to the OBDII connector, and the body is only attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and the affordable price is also attractive.
[Ashimori-kun] The world wing was launched in mid-September to prevent accelerator and brake step errors.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is plunged rapidly, the vehicle side detects the vehicle speed signal and brake signal, suppresses the accelerator opening by electrically suppressing the rapid advance.
If you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantly control the advance by turning it into a creeping state (where the brake is separated by the D range).
At the back of the vehicle, it is also equipped with a function to detect the speed of about 5Km/h or higher and force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The mounting is only possible with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

"I'm busy cleaning up my house and I didn't have enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can't panic and say 'OK' to children."
Yukari Okushi (36) in Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families, including three-year-old children.
"If I had a child who was not able to stay still, I would use my mind around me."
The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, where there were five children between 4 and 12 years old, was surrounded by water.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend my time at home as much as possible in a disaster, and I have food and simple toilets.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in family configuration and housing situation."
Ms. Shinko Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a 6-year-old and 8-year-old child said, "The elementary school had an e-mail on the day before, but there was no communication network or email system for the nursery school.
There was also a request to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "It was okay last time."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
TANAKA said, "I think the opinions issued will be conveyed to the government as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Urculi
The Police Agency (IOPC) will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandals of the Mayor of London in violation of criminal law.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts on acts" regarding the alleged suspicion that Archery had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"The matter of conduct exists in the presence of information indicating the possibility of a crime."
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this issue.
The problem was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC was an institution that responded to accusations issued by the police in England and Wales.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the police chief at the time.
Johnson denied cheating related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson said he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information about his relationship with Urculi, despite claiming that it was "constitutional."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but in the press, the Americans who moved to London seven years ago were paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the mayoral era of London.
Since then, the government has frozen a subsidy of 100,000 pounds to the hacker house, a company of Mr. Curi during the investigation.
The company will be asked questions about the investigation process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns the British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Curi (34) is currently based.
The relationship between Prime Minister and female businessmen was "public secret among staff."
The movement of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say that this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the previous night of the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"In any case, the supervisory authority did not submit any evidence, and the prime minister had no opportunity to answer the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late on Friday night."
Both the people and the mass media will be able to see the political Kyogen that was organized by Amasama.
As I mentioned earlier, Standard Newspapers heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division was "public secret."
The former staff of London & Partners (L&P) said that despite some people who believed that the company was "untrustworthy" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany foreign trade-related talks led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard about the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Iwakami Susumnobu.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all concerned people, not just the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of supporting the formation of property for general consumers.
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursued for 20 years.
If the general public is eliminated from the anxiety of money, the world will be brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operation is not performed unless you walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges like the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" has many money.
I feel that we understand the message that we have talked about since the time of the day, "We will support companies that are needed in the world."
We believe that this is the reason why we became a long-term fund for 20 years and that we continued to be a direct sales system that delivered messages directly to many people.
In the report at the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc miller's death, the third drug arrester is the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in overdose.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit pills of oxycodon, which had been accidentally possessed by Miller before he died of overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl, but Fentanil is a powerful opioid drug that has been plagued by thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying drugs to Cameron Petit, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Pettyt was getting drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Libis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, was accused of delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The prosecutors in charge of the first issue reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday requested that Walter be detained until the trial start due to the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to a phone call to a lawyer.
Pettyt was prosecuted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defenders refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics have been accompanied by a frank word about depression and drug use, which has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke out in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video to his Instagram and published a song called "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with opioid drug abuse in recent years.
The rock band Three Doors Down guitarist Matthew Roberts died in 2016 due to overdose of drugs, and Fentanil and Hydrocodon were detected in the body.
In this article, he revised Walter's spelling to Stephen instead of Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch2 to create a game of ghosts.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, animations and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats that come out of hiding places.
He learned how to play in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN that "I spend time making games when I'm bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course hosted by Codefest International was introduced to give children a chance to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, he became interested in Basil's game production.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but how about making games myself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basil, who has been interested in learning how to make his own games, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step in making the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his name to his game.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it becomes African innovation, the younger generation like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds have been awarded a robot that uses program code to separate housework.
In May 2019, a women's high school team from Ghana who programmed boxed robots won the Robofest Contest.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil-chan and the children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, false testimony of bribery investigation
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely testifyed to federal agents investigating corruption related to major political donors.
In the list of federal court cases, Robin Hayes will be convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of a judicial transaction and signed by Hayes' attorneys, Hayes was aware of false statements by FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Haze recognizes.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecution accused former Hayes of being involved in a plan for the insurance company's heavy duty to fund a campaign to the state's insurance director.
Both Greg Lindbergh and his co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cozy.
Lindberg is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported Republican principles and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer asked him to comment on Friday and email, but he did not reply.
On Friday, Hannes Davis, the defendant of Hayes, requested an additional comment by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken with Cozy about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to the facts, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cozy, and that he spoke directly with the supervisor.
The indictment published in April claimed that Lindberg had sought special treatment for his insurance business, and that he was planning to spend $2 million in an election campaign aimed at Cozy's reelection in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindberg's company.
Republican Cozy reported alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no suspicion.
Indictments are described in a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cozy that Lindberg's co-owners instructed Hayes to send $2.5 million to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would draw attention if he could move a lot of money, but eventually broke out in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
i know, i'll do it.
The Federal Prosecutors' Office of Public Prosecutors asked an e-mail for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like other people's posts!
This change, following the launch of similar tests of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and only posters can be seen.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager Mia Garrick said that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who consider the number of happy surveys and goodies to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had a very positive feedback from a number of bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
It is only to remove numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange rather than the number of good or reaction.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more confident than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
It is very early in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland and other countries where Instagram tests have been conducted.
Instagram, a Facebook affiliate, has not announced when this test will end or will remain unchanged.
"There were initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, who is in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very active Facebook and Instagram user.
He thought Australia would be a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience or not.

Self repair of broken bag fittings to otok ♪ 【Candu】 "Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was a part of Cando's handicrafts that helped me.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, the jaw is the ultimate Petit Plasma.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main body greatly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up.
First of all, I visited the home center to find a replacement for this connected fitting.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Candu for a bad time, I finally found it!
I was moved when I discovered it in the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It is originally a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle, and we bought two.
The size of the ring is small, but when you align it with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is a smooth installation.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outside.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, movement is poor ...
So, I decided to make a ring in two pairs.
The number of fittings increased, but because of the lighter parts, the weight is not quite a problem.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts that have been scratched has increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, an express train of JNR, travels 10 hours in Hiroshima - Kumamoto | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train designed by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A temporary train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded 12 blue carriages from Hiroshima Station and left Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destiny Campaign" by JR companies, a tour was organized.
The train consists of seven cars, including carriages and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo Line, Chikuto Line, and Kagoshima Line.

his brother's life imprisonment with the honor murder of a Pakistani social media star, kandir burochi.
Candy Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was hanged in July 2016.
His brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of his sister's murder on Friday, and sentenced to life imprisonment with an honorable homicide, the most popular in Pakistan.
Intelligent self-portrait photography - the extent that Western standards are not large, but in Pakistan, which is very strong for women's derogacy, it was provocative - the famous Baroch was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
In a press conference a few days later, his brother said, "Of course," killing his sister, that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Saldar Memoud, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan in the eastern city was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar (the thought of God) will be innocent in the Supreme Court," he said.
Prior to this, Balochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that his son wanted to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
The killing of Mr. Balochi has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of lightening the rules of father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "principal murders."
Women chose their marriage partner by themselves, and in the case of Mr. Barochi, they were burned by crimes such as praise of their sexuality and ashamed of their family.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow the perpetrators to be pardoned from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill that required life imprisonment for honorable homicide.
However, whether the murder is an honorable crime is at the discretion of the judge, the murderer can claim another motive in theory and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted that his son not be pardoned.
However, his parents, who were sad about losing his son, changed his mind and told him to forgive his son.
In response to international hate for killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented means of declaring the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
His famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team, and wearing a bright red dress that opened widely on Valentine's Day.
Although criticized and threatened, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that it opened up new heaven and earth in a country considered to be a political activity to enhance the status of women boldly to express oneself as a presence like Kim Kardashian.
The origins of "respectful" murder are ethnic social norms, which are still widespread in South Asia, particularly in women's behavior, although men may be victims.

In addition to actively cooperating in projects implemented by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both organizations engage in training related to sports, mediating and dispatching individual trainers and instructors, and sharing information.
When a team of remote islands embark on an expedition outside the island, they will work to resolve issues such as the lack of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in cooperation with the prefectural competitions and other events in mainland Japan, support is provided to prevent the performance of the athletes due to fatigue on board trips and nights.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players from outside the island by cooperating with local rectals and hospital officials.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Elabco in China-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.

Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where the conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice as much about "mote."
The brain science mothe theory is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Mote-no-Otoko adheres to the traditional "man's fantasy" and the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool man.
if you're stuck with it, you're going to live.
In the first part, "coolness" is constantly evolving, so I talked about various works, people's behavior, and needs to learn patterns every day.
When we learn patterns, we think that the brain can organize actions so that we can live in Lak.
I think it's still evolving every day, apart from whether it's "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit tough if you're stuck with the old pattern of "the university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say, "What should I do?" or "What should I do?"
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I've been talking about that in my recent interview book, Living in a terrible world.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that naturally emerge around him.
He doesn't want to be light.
It's hard to get around yourself.
I think Mr. Takeshi was doing this at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
There is no need to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," you cannot be light.
As long as I hear many women, regardless of position or age, it seems to be a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to find out what this "cute" is.

In the northwest of Nigeria, illegally doubling to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 in the last four months due to intensified violence.
According to the UN Refugee Organization, a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, new funding activities will be required for $35.5 million.
UNHCR spokesman Barbaru Barrok said that the Islamic extremist organization Boko Haram, which has been active in anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina in Nigeria over the past decade was caused by organized armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok told reporters on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, assault, murder and sexual violence were frequently occurring, and the raiders were destroying their homes and working on theft.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Boko Haram and the West African branch of Islamic State, which was split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," he says.
What they are involved is a horrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that, in particular, the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees crossing Niger would increase in the coming months.
the new trial date for a man who killed two women and two children is confirmed.

According to Polk County Court records, Marvin Escobar Ollyana (31) was prosecuted for the first-class murder in three cases, the alleged name of Marvin Esquibel Lopez, who had previously been named by the police.
He claims innocence.
According to the police, on July 16, in a demo-in housing, he shot Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and son (5).
In court records, a new date of trial will be determined on January 27, giving the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare for the trial.
According to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Bureau officials, Escobar Ollyana was illegally staying in the U.S. and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.

Header biding is a mechanism that allows media operators to prioritize high-priced ads by competitive bidding with multiple bidders.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
In the past, SSP has been provided for advertising.
In recent years, in response to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year in collaboration with media companies to directly purchase advertising frameworks that meet the needs of advertisers.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP's header binding allows them to directly participate in bids for header bids and increase the delivery of ads.
In addition, due to the limited number of media companies in the target market, the advertising framework for each commercial and brand image is also secured to prevent damage to brand value.
One of the advantages of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each Vidder company called "Lapper Solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, enables initiatives that meet the expectations of introducing media companies.

Two months of suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced on the 27th that a male assistant professor at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Department of General Affairs, in October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, male assistants became emotional and abused in inappropriate words, and repeatedly gave strong mental stress.
He was recognized as a pawahara of education guidance and that the learning environment deteriorated.
A survey conducted in September 18 reported several students.
The management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and from December of the same year, they conducted an investigation at the Harasssment Prevention Committee by teachers at the Yonezawa Campus.
In response to the findings from the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
Even after the survey, the male assistant professor continued to receive education, but his actions were improved through interviews and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deep sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to take all of my studies to prevent harassment and work to recover trust."
The university also conducts internal surveys on suspected sexual harassment of female students taught by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts The San Paper demands Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and make a compromise with the EU.
Just three weeks after the EU summit meeting, the Prime Minister's concern is growing around the Prime Minister.
Boris Johnson faces a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of withdrawal from the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations over a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are packed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel will propose a compromise proposal on the ground floor, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to confront the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They will demand the Prime Minister to abandon the "extreme" strategy that threatens the EU devised by the senior advisor Dominique Camings with unconstitutional withdrawals, and insist that the EU will accept the offer to withdraw in limited time.
One cabinet member said that the ruling that the Supreme Court's closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday was "the alarm," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his step.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and the Camings project is clearly failing.
It is impossible to fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to run an agreement with Prime Minister Terryza May.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many that everyone is trying to end this.
If we do not postpone, Boris will end, and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer accused Boris of not seriously considering negotiations.
In a harsh speech, the former leader of the Conservative Party said, "The Prime Minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we do not see the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU in order to establish an agreement.
Instead, what we saw was that the prime minister in Scotland was fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Uerres, and discussing with the people in the streets.
The Prime Minister's press acknowledged yesterday that the agreement was still a long time ahead, and said, "If anyone does not think about it, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month re postponement, would greatly weaken the position of our negotiations in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue their progress despite the enactment of the bill."
The European Union Delegation Minister Stephen Berkeley returns to Brussels today to discuss further with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorain Kelly: I was told that the Glasgow accent would never be a success in the television world.
Lorain Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, revealed that he was told by the bosses of the television station that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I worked as a surveyor at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe he was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began her name, Lorain.
To celebrate her 35th anniversary, she broadcast a special show that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
He added that passion and enthusiasm and curiosity were the key to survival in the television industry, and that the host said, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and honest.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that the interview was "very spicy" about the Dunbrane shooting.
I didn't think that many of the families of children who were killed or wounded were watching the show broadcast live from Dunbulane the day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, told me to personally meet me, so we were able to speak at her house for hours.
I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McKan's daughter Maderrain were missing, saying that it was "very painful" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, fear of traps, chiwenga.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of presidents from the late President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to anxiety that it might be a trap to follow military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give the presidency, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Chiwenga refused the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders of all over the world and the African Union that he was deprived of the regime in a coup, rather than anxiety.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, officials confirmed that he was a senior official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has held the administration for 37 years, is willing to give the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munangagwa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, tried to contact Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late presidents was carried out by three.
President Spokesman George Charanba, senior officials said that Aaron Nepera, the top representative of the Central Intelligence Organization at the time, and Fidelis Mukonoli, Roman Catholic bishop, were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, the former governor of Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Chiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death, attempted to denounce military action by the African Union while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to give the presidency to former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of the former president.
"Some of the late President's family began to suffer from fatigue, and it was an abandoned act to save the rapidly expanding situation that was dangerous," he wrote.
However, at least in diplomacy alone, the political aim of the late president was a little.
If anything destroys the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the views of the African Union on the coup, but remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was at the top of the military at that time, would trap the claims of the commanders claiming that he had not broken the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, would decide whether it would be a coup, would eventually be called a coup, and that the military intervention request would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe would have to write his resignation.
The commanders of the army told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the president's house called Blueloo, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that point, Mugabe wanted two things to protect his family and to prove his power deprivation by the military.
The commanders and commanders at that time read their intentions accurately.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa" (which we belong to the Kamo Fullerge group, the military department) were used to describe a powerful metaphor for political competition if not a politician.
The Army told the other commanders of the region that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munangaguwa, who had been in short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at that time, the key South Africans in this process refused to intervene, but as they repeatedly threatened behind it, it was clear that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military invaded the office.
"Just because it wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, it didn't come to fruition," he said.
The United Nations Appeals for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons The ratification of the Convention in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[New York Joint] On 26th at the UN Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and Michi Takenouchi (63) of the second atomic bomb, a granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, spoke to support the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
Five countries have ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and 32 countries and regions have ratified it.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were made according to the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern in recent years that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is no other way to eliminate it."
China needs strong leadership, and if it doesn't, the collapse of policy documents
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In the White Paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic conditions are complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified strong leadership, China will lead to division and collapse, and will be a disaster for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratization movement that occurred in Beijing in 1989.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held the government in late 2012, further strengthened the control of the party and tightened the resistance to the party.
Mr. Xi has also directed a military modernization program that threatens the region.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export the development model of its own country, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but merely seek peace instead of supremacy.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied from the bullies, and war and confusion left a deep scar with its pain; China would never give the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as the economic downturn and the anti-government movement in China Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never abandon its nuclear interests and will not allow the loss of security and sovereignty.
"The threat of trade war and the continuing tariffs are nothing to solve any problem," says White Paper in connection with the trade dispute with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with the momentum of complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development.
"It never weakens in the trade war."
I am confident that China has the power to face difficulties, transform crisis into opportunities, and open a new world.
He added that the United States should calmly capture the development of China, as China does not have any idea to counter the U.S. and does not want to replace it with the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
The United States will not maintain its strength if it is to suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka dismissed Mr. Hirata and Mr. Kaneko, Director of Sports, Science and Technology - Yahoo! News
Yokohama Taka, a high school baseball master who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced on 28th that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masashi Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as a coach and the director (responsive teacher) will be determined promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that local newspapers had a riot with baseball club members.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's neck, and Director Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they were dismissed on 28 October, as they generally accepted the facts.
In the summer of 1515, Motochika WATANABE (74) who raised pitchers such as Daisuke MATSUSAKA (present-day Nakanichi) left the club.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
From summer 16 to summer, he participated in Kokoen in the summer for three consecutive years, and also participated in Senbatsu in this spring.
However, after losing to Sagamihara in the semifinals in this summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in autumn and was desperate for the next spring.
The Spice Girls' MelC, the eating disorders, and the diet topics are banned in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom admitted that diets were banned at home from their own eating disorders, which over the years did not eat anything other than fruits and vegetables.
Sportsy spices have been "excessive exercise" under pressure from members of the global pop group for many years, and have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by the child rearing of his daughter Scarlett, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"When Scarlett was 10 years old, he began to care about his appearance."
However, because I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful about how to communicate with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's customs.
In the 1990s, when she gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, in front of SNS Taito, a "bad" comment on herself written in the media led to physical problems, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, became more and more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted almost a few years."
Judiciary judgment of same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch recognized this in a case where 'the marriage of facts (internal marriage)' was a dispute between the same sex.
More than 20 countries accept same-sex marriages, and in Japan, there is a system for local governments such as Sapporo to certify same-sex partnerships.
Based on this, the court recognized the reality of marriage between two women.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to recognize legal protection by the same-sex couples.
There are five legal cases in which the same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Register Act, which require compensation to the country as unconstitutional.
In order to overcome the ruling, I would like to deepen my understanding of the protection of the rights of sexual minorities and discuss how the legal system should allow various families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years, and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The court ruled that "the reality of marriage between men and women is not the same" because of the results of living with two people.
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of married couples with the right to marry in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that defines marriage as "only based on mutual consent."
It is said that both sexes were "not considered same-sex marriages at the time of establishment, so it is not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
"The Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," but it is expected that it will be a driving force for the same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women," the problem remained.
While recognizing the same situation as between men and women, it is difficult to distinguish the right to protect.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, about 70% of people considered same-sex marriage to be legally recognized, and public awareness has changed.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, the law is bound by traditional family statues, and it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a spouse who accepts the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from various viewpoints, such as not only marriage between the same sex but also the expansion of legal rights for marriage.
to the trial and jury trial of former athletes indicted for rape against multiple women.
A jury trial was held for former Delaware University baseball players who were prosecuted for sexual assaults by multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and speech, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's life luck.
A 21-year-old woman tells her she was sexually assaulted after she sent her to her home by car.
After three weeks of meeting at Bumble, Konaway sent her nude photos to women.
Konaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecutors claimed that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Konaway attempted to assault women.
The defenses have argued that women's contradictory claims and memory differences may have regretted having physical relations.

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, the video reveals
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million annually to the Australian economy, Sydney Harbour is one of the largest contributors to the opera house, the Cerculer Key, the Luna Park and the famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of the worst waterways in Australia, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow through the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist spots is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around the most popular cities in Australia have a large number of suckers, plastic bags, plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all of which are in the Sydney Harbour by rainwater flowing through the road.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clogging waterways.
Dr. Catherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most modified and contaminated estuaries of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but after that, Sydney Harbour was pretty tragic," Dr. Duffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, in a corner of the iceberg, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited on the sea floor.
"I don't really know what the truth is there if I don't go down the sea level," said David Center Manley, owner Richard Nichols, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is under the water surface), I think everyone will be really cool.
It's overwhelming, but more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
Plastics are used at least somewhere in the remaining half.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone can see that all of these plastics and wastes are flowing down the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of Ocean Protet, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce plastic and waste flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the amount of plastic, recycles more well, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
However, we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old appearance, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing people.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also presented this month, as part of the activities to encourage Australian citizens to know about environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new survey, 82 percent of the 546 children between 12 and 18 have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also stated that the problem of plastic waste for parents was ranked fourth among concerns, and that 93 percent of the 551 parents surveyed felt increasingly uneasy about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Station was demolished in October | Saga News | Saga Newspapers
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which started demolition work in October, is Futatako, Karatsu City
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) located in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
Disassembly was used to drain gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
It was originally three, and one was removed in 1991.
Each chimney is split from the top of the tower crane and dismantled.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
There was a pity, and a man in his 60s who ran a restaurant nearby said, "When I saw a chimney from the far away, it was like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port, and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because it is near Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine, agreed to use the site in 15 years.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round was held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at the past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
(18)
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020.
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which Formula One (F1) and World Endurance Championship (FIA) are held.
Since 1973, it has been the world's highest rally championship with a history and tradition, and it is said that it is the most challenging car racing championship to run at high speeds not only on closed public roads (paved roads), but also on gravel and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999 and became a big topic.
This time, the Japan Round Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsports Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship 2020 to be held in Japan, and we will work hard to achieve the success of the 2020 Fall Games in cooperation with relevant parties so that we can make a big appeal to the world as the center of motorsports representing Japan."
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan Round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports competition for this prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very pleased to be able to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motorsports, commented on the event.
The Japan Round of the WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Kurarakucho) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ebisu City).
The main venue is the "Love / Earth Expo Memorial Park" opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exhibition.
In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is it the key to cancer treatment?
Tusmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could bring great reforms to patient treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells were camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will lead to new methods for cancer treatment.
What is common between Tasmanian devil and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers at the Peter McClellan Cancer Center in Melbourne found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, treatment for cancer could significantly change.
It may be the key to addressing fatal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils on the verge of extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 to cam fullage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and skin cancers called Merkel cells.
"The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Reuse traditional treatments, revitalizing markers, i.e. proteins known as MHC, may enable immune systems to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Doson said.
"Lung cancer is an epidemic in the world.
And treatment can be done in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where cancer cells escape detection.
"Unfortunately, the same process occurs at all (to humans and Tasmanian devil cancers)," Professor Dawson said.
"To date, it was very difficult to treat Tusmaniadeville tumor.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may be useful to control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting polar stars.
Scientists have discovered and amazed the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, which orbits a giant Jupiter-shaped planet around a small star called Red dwarf, 30 light-years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of a giant gas planet GJ3512b orbiting its main star, Red dwarf.
Stars are usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star, known as the GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, the Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, led by this research published in Science.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only quite small than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, and only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why it's red."
While there is a trace that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet could have been released from its star system in the past, and explained the elliptic orbit of its Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which produced stars orbiting themselves.
The most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, generates objects from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes atmosphere by pulling the egg out of the planet.
A conflict model called a self-gravity instability model may explain this rare planetary system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature might have been lower."
Because the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
the deli employees, the stimulant bean dips are eaten by colleagues and prosecuted.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating dipping beans with awakening agents to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was charged with the transfer of methane fetamin to B-class felony and suspected of taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were attributed to the incident that occurred at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to the estimates of the oaths obtained from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked the sheriff of Marion County to let him taste a little because he saw Medina Hernández making beans.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach became worse and her legs were fluffy.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, at a local hospital where women went, it was judged that soy dip could contain methane phetamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee told the victim's food that Medina Hernández "was told him to put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane fetamine into a soy dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deer shows that Medina Hernández is stuck behind the camera and behind the microwave.
It is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table to put the beans dip in a small paper dish.
The police said that the stuff taken out of the brazier was put on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff said that there are no customers who have been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was jailed in Marion County instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of assault, robbery, suffrage, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Creating Challenges" President of JR Tokai, attach importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on the 27th, President Shin Kaneko of JR Tokai reiterated his stance on early construction, stating that the issue of reducing the flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen Minami Alps Tunnel is a matter of concern with Shizuoka Prefecture.
More specifically, he said, "Let's talk at the meeting place and at the front stage."
President Kaneko stressed, "It's not easy to start the project after organizing all the problems, and I think it's possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea, and we have to talk about it."
The county side is concerned that the spring water that came out during the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
In regard to changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the view that "If there is something practical, I think it is difficult to think about the safety aspects of construction."
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the change of route mentioned was "not possible."
The impact on the opening period was that President Kaneko pointed out three locations: the South Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station, which took a particularly long time for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Saga News | Saga Newspapers
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required restructuring and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced their hospital name on 26th.
The total population of 13 medical institutions in the prefecture is 38 and 5%, which is the 10th highest in the country, and three already integrated and relocated.
The hospital name of the publicized prefecture is Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Mieki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Citizen Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), Taramachi Tatara Hospital in Fujitsu County.

Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating surplus in recent years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi stressed that "As a town, we have the idea of operating alone and collaborating with hospitals in neighboring towns, and hospitals must be left absolutely for residents," and expressed negative views on restructuring and integration.
The administrative director of the Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "We do not hear the contents from the prefecture," and he said, "We will actively participate in the Regional Medical Planning Coordination Meeting in the prefecture, and will respond based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Organization for Promotion of Regional Medical Functions (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not a mechanical decision to determine the direction of public hospitals, but a request was made at the Regional Medical Planning Coordination Conference in each prefecture to review them again."
"I would like to hear from the parties about the future hospital operation.
In some cases, it may be necessary to review medical subjects and to further reduce the sickbed."

It is well understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
However, it is not only the queen who loves fashion.
The Marquess of Cambridge are said to have their own taste when carrying their clothes, and in Uwasa, they take one seat per dress.

My job was almost always to find myself that children want to grow and stay a moderate distance.
It is not the ideal for children as parents or the admiration of their childhood, but in essence to find out who they are.
Mrs. Obama, who actually knows the pressure on spotlights in the world, advised the Duchess little by little in the interview of Good Housekeeping.
sometimes the pressure from myself and the people around me feels too big.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't rush to do anything over time.

Trump Hotel owner's right to complain, but also holds a license to sell liquor.
Washington (AP) - The Board of Alcohol and Beverage Administration in Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license for the sale of liquors at the local Trump International Hotel, as the owner was questionable.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three senators, two former judges and two Jewish leaders that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second appeal to cancel the right to provide alcohol at the Hotel is based on a state law requiring the applicant to obtain a license for selling alcohol.
In the first appeal submitted in the summer of last year, he repeatedly accused President Trump of assault and accused him of violating state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time that a petition was issued to update the permit.
The honey collected by Bentley's "Fly Bees" bees is the first harvest!
how about the taste of honey collected by the Flying Bees raised in the knee of the Flying B
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September 2019.
More than 100 bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees at the factory site where cars were assembled?
I want to taste this!
Bentley's honey is here (11)
Peter Bosch, executive officer in the manufacturing department of Bentley, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant this year.
The beekeepers watched the scene from wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains where honey bees are gathering various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities to become the top of sustainable luxury automakers through the Crew Plant and our business.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of betray honey.
A small step leads to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives in order to play our own role."
In September of the same year, a summer passed, the work of removing the nest from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was put into a centrifugal separator, and after filtering the fallen honey, it was bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with a Bentley-like commitment.
The label was designed by Louise McClum, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also served as a gift for important customers and guests to visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
I would like to enjoy afternoon tea, not only Fenner Tea, which is compatible with honey, but also honey from Flying Bees, etc.
it's the worst of the u.K. in a series of scandalous reports.
A police officer who followed the scandal was declared the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud, which was inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continues to be "a serious deterioration," says Phil Gomley of the Police Department.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new calls for demolition.
According to the report, efforts to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect socially vulnerable persons were neglected.
Phil Gomley of the Police Department said, "It's been a long time since we finally investigated it."
The police chief Mike Vill resigned in January less than a year after his appointment, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for multiple charges of unpublished.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee for the illegal act because of his colleague's involvement in sexual acts.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
It's time for the Interior Ministry to intervene."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal" and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what's going on.
At present, we believe that we are involved in a cover-up case, and it may take some time to investigate it."
"I'm going to do my work based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," said Pelosi.
This week's White House record revealed that Trump asked President Vladimir Zerensky of Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zerensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal adviser, Rudi Giulani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security attorney in the Ministry of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, who was charged as an inquiry by information agencies, judged that Trump's telephone talks were not covered by the investigation of political financing violations.
In response to the question of whether Burr should testify, Pelosi stated on Friday that he would decide who the Special Intelligence Committee would call witnesses.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"I was able to get the name of the bar from beginning to end," said Pelosi, and touched on Trump's name for the Secretary of Justice regarding the telephone talks with the President of Ukraine in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will approach the judgment regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower who became the source of information when Trump attacked the accuser on Thursday as a spy and hinted that he had been treated differently in the past.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that the whistleblower plays an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to the whistleblower is a significant loss in the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump for impeachment and wrote a historical step.
The call content is contained in the accusations published on Thursday, and the whistleblower claims that Trump abused his right to seek intervention in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisers instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-grade computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Bentek, speed violation prohibited driving
The Premier League star, Christian Bentek, who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, was banned from driving.
The 28-year-old forward at Crystal Palace allowed her to drive her Bentley on January 20, and to drive 50 miles per hour at a speed limit of A3 in Richmond, southwest London.
In March, the Belgians then filmed a speed violation control camera in Patney, southwest London, driving at 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Lavender Hill Court of Justice this morning.
In early July, Bentek was convicted of these two violations under a single trial procedure that allowed one judge to hear the judgment of light crimes.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the Review Committee
Cofi Manu, a football administ and executive at Secondi Hasccus, expressed concern about the composition of the review committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davis and expressed his dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA Sports, Mr. Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the results of the examination process, and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should be composed of fair and neutral members from outsiders who are not affiliated with each member before.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Parma about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manuel argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
On the other hand, Mr. Fred Papoe, the Olympic Director of the Olympic Committee, stated that if he attended the Committee, the relationship between the club and the chairman would result in conflict of interest.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after the inauguration of the ceremony held at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Akpocavi, a sports director.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture think that it is good for a minimum wage of 1,000 yen.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the scheduled number was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and 30% for non-regular employees.
The number of companies who answered "approved" to raise the hourly salary to 1,000 yen was 100 percent, construction work (70, 6 percent) and wholesale business (61, 7 percent).
The percentage of "reverse" was majority in manufacturing (51, 9 percent) and service businesses (60 and 9 percent), including eating and drinking, and staying.
The representative of the meeting said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high proportion of opposition in industries with a high part and a lot of time paid."
The average amount of money was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, the hiring of new graduates was 61/3 percent for regular employees, 54-5 percent for mid-term employment, and 154% for non-regular employees.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the expected number was 44, 7 percent, 50 and 3 percent, while non-regulars remained 31 and 1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (37.5%, 37.5%) and the construction industry (24.1%, 38.1%) struggled.
A total of 86.4% had challenges in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the company's reputation was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information to new graduates (residence within three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% answered, "I have already accepted it."
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to accept it in the future," one third of the overall acceptance posture was expressed.
The company was 64 and 4%, with construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%) and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted between July 19 and August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiprick said, "I'm here to show you now," when Wales will host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Walla Beads, it will become the hottest candidate in Pool D, and perhaps the quarterfinal against France or Argentina will be assured.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game win against Wales was the 14th win, Tiprick and his team would be the 8th straight line against England.
"It's natural, I want to challenge both teams and win at the top of the group, and I want to end," said Tiprick, a Welsh merchant.
Until now, the fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win in autumn last year.
Australia thinks it's a lot of blame for returning the loan, but it's time to make sure it won again.
I knew it was a mountain before I came here.
and i'm here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and the win to Wallads is the third place in 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the total score for the Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight 3 team was only 7 wins in 41 races.
Wales stopped the test match last November with 13 defeats in Australia, but Tiprick was included in the 9-6 victory squad and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiplic said: "It's hard to answer.
Surely the game was tough, maybe everyone thought it would not win, but I don't know.
As a result, I got about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed that the score was far less than actually."
To win Wales, a break-down battle with Tiplic is key to the Australian duo, Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Law.
Up until now, Tiprick has played 67 international matches, and has played several matches and two players in the past.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you'll always know that you're going to face a tough game.
They are always at the highest level in the world.
I'm fully aware of what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in defensive battles, and Michael is an aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when necessary.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself, rather than confronting the very strong background.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against them, you have to keep up with yourself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose on the momentum.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings '90 percent of the gala', would it really be a gift from performers?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo, triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces, have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said in a press conference on July 22 that "the company doesn't have any talent like one at 9," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha rebounded.
If the ratio of "9:1" is 90% to Yoshimoto, it is considered that there was a gift from comedians to Yoshimoto, and the views of investors who were taxed are also streamed on Twitter.
If the Gala deal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was asked by Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax first.
If "9:1" is the amount of work for 1 million yen, then Yoshimoto Kogyo will earn 1 million yen in sales and 90 million yen in expenses.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you are wondering about allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount you received will be declared as sales.
If the person who gave the gift does not recognize it, it will not be a gift.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g. buying and selling real estate) away from the original market for tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating tax.
However, as this time, a third party will not decide on how much tax appropriate prices are for those that both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think the payment statement for 1 yen is a poison.
[Interview cooperation tax accountant] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working as a bank, he registered as a tax accountant in 2008.
University lecturers, seminars, writing and other activities are extensive.

the white house, the impeachment apprehensive, panic.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and detailed officials in this issue explained that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have been increasing concerns, anxiety, and concerns about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could inflict a significant damage to the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't know what it is like."
The White House officials joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, or that the normal measures that the President had made to deal with the matter before could not apply, so there was no confidence in how to proceed because the claim was so serious.
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" because the President's response to the impeachment was delayed and the prospect of being "pure."
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the President is expected to be raised every day, and there are also close associates of the President who are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has been spurred by concerns about the increasingly unpredictable behavior and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and is concerned about President and Politics in the environment of election year.
Trump faced the greatest threat ever before in his presidential term, and revived his strategy, which he considered effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Morler, and has changed his hands, becoming an offensive or defense.
Trump tried to lighten the request of the Ukrainian President to cooperate with the investigation of political opponents, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credit of whistleblowers as a motive for factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials endured the Mora investigation, but this time they began to feel the difference.
Although he is a brand president, he seemed to be visiting at a press conference on Wednesday.
Although Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, it seems that he was not in the heart of answering questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers have identified the fact that they did not have direct information about the call with President Trump, Vladimir Zerensky, and Ukrainian Presidents, who have been controversial, claim that it is a fact that undermines the creditworthiness of whistleblowers and are convinced that damage can be reduced.
Furthermore, it often happens when the President is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic family, close to the White House, points out that the basic support rate of the president is already very high and the effect of impeachment to acquire new supporters is not much.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those who claim impeachment could help the President did not fully understand how uncertain the response of the President would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the plan, this initiative is still in the early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as strategic decision rooms will be implemented.
However, this person said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations activities aggressively in order to counter the momentum of the publication and publication of critical internal accusations on Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munshin, who stated that they would not publish notes on calls with President Trump's Ukraine 48 hours later.
According to the person involved in this case, the person who might be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump, and Corrie Luwanduski, who served as the head of the former electoral control headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"I've been doing everything I can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but I've never talked with the president or close adviser about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney Jay Carrow is also involved in impeachment efforts.
In an interview with NBC News, Crow replied, "The problem is properly handled."
Emmet Frad, who was engaged in the impeachment of Clinton and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left Pat Cipolon, the current White House legal adviser, with less experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience of impeachment.
Details of the White House's strategy are generally aware that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but must be organized and capable of leading all-powerful response efforts and political struggles.

I said, "Let's get married someday," but I can't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation to marriage with our allies?
Editorial I of Nikkei dors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa, who gave lectures on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice and must be read.
this is my concern.
I'm worried about whether I should continue dating my boyfriend in distant love.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I have work and my family, but his work is in Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that "Let's get married in the future."
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from distant love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editor C is in love with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to test the distance and the two will be strong," but in the first place, is it going to work well?
Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) It is famous for a survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered.
Because love is done with five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touching), smelling (no smell), kissing (taste).
However, in the case of distant love, there is a case where you can hear your voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing only situations.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to your opponent's house, you'll have time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if you're on a holiday to heal the fatigue of your work, your body is a matter.
When I return home, I feel relaxed.
Isn't it possible to break up after a distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently, or a couple whose distance is determined in advance.
If you're engaged a year later, or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you don't see a future landing point.

debin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Devin Nunes, a California Republican, seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, in a comment to defend the President, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Congressman Nunes, a Republican executive of the House Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of a hearing about the internal charges Trump requested to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the full naked picture of the President, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with Ukrainians who seemed to be Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the President, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes, Huffpost's senior political correspondent Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democratic Party is trying to find the truth.
He was the only member of the House of Representatives from the Democratic Party of Connecticut, Jim Haynes, but many other members questioned whether the answer was red and naked.
Mediate Dotcom speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more detailed details of unidentified details" that are said to have been written in a controversial steel document.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected by Trump in a hotel in Moscow looking at the urination of prostitutes.
Origami, wallet and real card.
Transfer, Loan, Insurance, Investment - Yahoo! News
In addition to payment by Origami Pay, Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to transfer money and withdraw money through collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they will start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services said, "We will create new financial services to solve the problems of the younger generation that need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates," adding that "For example, we want to provide services that are equally useful for people who have been alienated from finance and those who have not benefited from the system until now."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origami ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get timely information.
In addition to the Origami app, he explained that by deploying it on partner companies' apps, it would be possible to use the Origami app without having to have it.
In terms of financing, we introduce functions that can be repaid in conjunction with payment.
In addition, when funds were needed suddenly, the Origami app was completed from application to repayment.
In terms of insurance, the company introduced Aioi Nisei Insurance and First Life as a partner company.
The two companies will use their data and knowledge to develop insurance products in line with life events.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually through registration of necessary administrative agencies.
New business for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support effective utilization of data, including data held by companies, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its payment function.
We recognize that effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge in partner companies that partner with Origami to acquire structured data such as sales and unstructured data in real society, accumulate, process, and analyze data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with its payment data and structured data owned by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.
Mr. Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies gather various data and make customer contacts," and explained, "In the next phase, how to use data to develop business models is key."
"We want to create next phase innovation by combining data built on the Origami Network and data from many companies."
Details of specific services will be announced sequentially.
In addition, at the Origami Conference 2019, we will introduce the future initiatives of Origami, such as providing coupons to smartphones when it rains.
In addition, the compensation for unauthorized use is now fully compensated by Origami Pay, but it is clarified as a system in terms of use.
In addition, he announced that he will work as a supporter in cooperation with tourism associations and other organizations.
It was held in Aweena Osaka, Osaka on September 7 to commemorate the singer Mitsuko Ogasawara, who died at the age of 100 in July this year.
the people involved showed the representative songs of Ogasawara
Approximately 140 Japanese people participated, including the chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Mr. Yunaga, and Mr. Yukie Ikebe, chairman of the Japan-Korea Music Arts Exchange Association.
In the ceremony, President Yukie IKEBE greeted me first.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I still can't believe that the teacher passed away."While preparing for "Remembers' Meeting," Mr. Mitsuko Ogasawara felt how wonderful and great he was."
On the other hand, he said, "If you can do activities that can expand the meeting even a little," he said.
After being dedicated to silence, Messe-ji was introduced by Mr. Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the Korea Arts Exchange Association and the Chuchu Institute of International Studies.
the possibility of exhaust gas reduction in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, but the only thing that flies in the air is that renewable energy is not available.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta developed a technology to make renewable biofuels available as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor of agricultural and bioenvironmental sciences at Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as fats, livestock rendering, and canola oil from restaurants.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low-quality oil and fats for production, while carbon emissions are less than 85% of crude oil-based fuels, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technique also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology was achieved by hydrocarbons of molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma that doesn't matter," said Bresler.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bresler described the second option: "You can test it with a reactor to change chemical reactions a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They expect someone to impose carbon tax in the future."
I want to prepare a substitute for the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmondton's Waste Management Center, and recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin to help build 2500 million production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel per year.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher for fuel transport and production.
"As a technical shop," says Bresler.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decisions described.

Boris Johnson warned that if Brexit was overturned, Britain would face riots like Los Angeles, the prime minister would call for calmness.
A senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a danger that "a violent riot by the people" would occur in this country.
High officials of the prime minister warned that Britain would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that he "nearing anger" was necessary for political words exchanged with intense speech, but insisted that he would not stop using the term "default."
Despite the appeal of the prime minister to regain his calmness, one minister said to the Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Yellow Best Movement or the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and then there's a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who were beaten by a black taxi driver Rodney King to be innocent.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government protesters wearing the eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed to Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives, stating that if Britain failed to leave the EU, credit for Japan's political system would be catastrophic.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, the 10 million people would be unhappy."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time until tens of thousands of people go through the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first result, there was a danger that "a violent riot by the people" would occur in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing the House of Representatives rebellion, which seeks to lower the demands for EU withdrawal and instead beat the EU in a compromise.

Pakistani social media celebrity brother named honor homicide for life
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the incident is diluted.
"It's too long, so people forget" women's rights activist Farzana Bali, the founder of the first gender department at the University of Pakistan, said it took more than three years to solve even the Barochi incident, which is attracting attention.
Although human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "elebrated murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the actual number of honorable homicides is much more than that, because it is estimated that approximately one fifth of the 5,000 honorable homicides occurring every year around the world are occupied by Pakistan.
Countermeasures against pork cholera 1.3 billion yen To add to the September correction plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo! News
It was reported by the Congressional Committee on the 26th that the prefecture would add a total of 148 million yen to the supplementary budget plan in September, with a budget of $13,600 million, and a budget related to the decision-making expenses required to obtain land for the elevated JR Numazu Station.

Floods and disruptions caused by monsoons in many areas
The Monsoon season in India is about a month long, unprecedented rainfall caused buildings collapse and death, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month is usually 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, Monsoon will weaken in the late past decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune in the western part of India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays resulted in the collapse of the building and the disaster.
The houses were flooded, and the residents crossed the street with water on their knees, usually seen only at the peak of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Laguna and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In the northern part of Uttarakand, heavy rains caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
Monsoons are not desirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Vimtar, Uttarakand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but vegetables are rotting by rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow, weak Monsoon effect.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pens) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees (about 1 pound).
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dašera on 8 October, where the Hindus set up Ravana, an evil laugh figure of a beard that appears in the giant comic book-style doll, epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the dolls are made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, it may be Lavana to laugh at the end.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
The latest research shows that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu, who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this study may not be applied to women and other races because it is targeted only by Japanese Americans.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study showed the greatest impact within ten years after exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," said Dr. Rodriguez.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to aging and hiding possible relationships between pesticides and mental disorders in the last years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko intervention at the meeting of zerensky Trump phone
The U.S. President Donald Trump's impeachment was made, and the Washington political issue was a dramatic week.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners Vladimir Zerensky.
But what has been known about the Zellensky Trump phone problem so far, and is there a widespread influence on Zerensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zerensky that the U.S. is more convenient to Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the fact that Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders were devoted to speaking rather than concrete proposals.
The response of Zerensky, who opposed Trump 100% rather than 1000 percent, is considered controversial.
Zerensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties, argued on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poloshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for support received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he thanked the EU for its support including Russian sanctions and economic assistance during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voyticica said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Following Trump's request for military assistance, instead of one, to ask Zerensky for two surveys, the first is to suggest Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is to investigate the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would interfere with European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
"I would like to thank the people who helped me with the announcement of the call record," Zerensky said at the New York General Assembly.
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled for October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana in recognition of its interim effective implementation rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Air Force's Global Safety and supervisory audit report.
The safety award was approved by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding safety at airports and in their own territories.
These awards were created as part of the support of the ICAO's delayed national zero campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications and 17 certifications for safety evaluations were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Minister of Aviation Joseph Kofiada Ghana, Director of Civil Aviation Simon Alati Ghana, Ambassador Nii Iiko Otou to Canada, and Director of Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICA), Olmiwa Bennard Aliu, emphasized the need to maintain aviation safety in the participating countries.
"It is important to continue to realize that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also stated that the award is a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's efforts and perseverance.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a great future to develop domestic economies, as "airs are likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but they are all safe and secure that we have achieved.

After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of Butanhanie oil (intensified cannabis oil) was found at an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that investigators also found equipment packed with beep cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
Captain Cano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigation and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used in the Bayp product.
"The static electricity from clothes can only be ignited, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fire but also explosions."
In addition, if there were multiple containers, the entire building could be blown away not only by fire one after another.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
He received an anonymous information and told the investigators that it led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still in pursuit of who is the black curtain of illegal Bayp activities.
Police said that because the office was empty, Zhang himself believed that the office had a store.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that, in particular, they would like to receive recent news related to the dangers of bating, tend to illegal babyping products and not go out again.
"I don't know whether it's real or not."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have caused great harm to our communities and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there is a 6-strong earthquake!
Evacuation training at the Hall of Miyazaki City - Yahoo!
As the earthquake occurred during the concert, a practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City.
This training is held every year.
At the stage, there is actually a performance by the Miyazaki Fire Department, and it is assumed that there will be 6 quakes in the middle of the song.
Approximately 300 people participated in training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff.

Participants were again raising awareness of disaster prevention through training.
Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was woven with silver foil threads made of the finest camlet silk, and the gorgeous embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Herstic Royal Palace dress collection curator, Ellery Lynn, has decided to be one.
This faded piece of cloth, which was hung on a wall of a small church in one countryside, was placed there 100 years ago, and is thought to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this gorgeous cloth used as the altarpiece of the church in Bactton in Herefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited at the Hampton Court Palace next month, near exactly that room where the Queen of Tudor could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one other dress left in the 16th century was found in the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence for Elizabeth's dress through the sleeves, a three-year study led to the conviction of the expert that the dress was not part of the royal possession.
The "silver silk cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but it also suggests that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later was noble.
At the time the dress was made, it seems that the price was equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rivals wearing such gorgeous clothes could not endure.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he also came to see colleagues.
When I looked at the cloth, I was always happy to say, "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one piece of dress used as an altar cloth of the Holy Face Church of Bactton, cut off and blind, seems unexpected but not so.
Bactton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and is said to have long been associated with Parry.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
More than 1000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and a very delicate hand-sewing altar cloth, will be displayed next to Elizabeth's portrait of a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition period.
The vast space as much as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, where most of the conservation work was done and the work was directed by Libby Thompson, who said, "I feel really respect for the craftsmanship of the people who made it."
When you look at the embroidered face and back, you will be very respectful to those who made it.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request was searched and found" One week after the missing female child, the Self-Defense Force withdrew and the volunteer men were missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
The first-year-old girl in elementary school is missing at a campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces had no clues yet, and on 28th, they closed and withdrew.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared, and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village requested to withdraw from the Self-Defense Forces as "the scope of the request was searched."
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed 650 people, mainly on the slopes of the mountain and dangerous places such as Sawa.
Also, on 27th, the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who participated in the search by volunteers disappeared, and the search was not found.
The police and fire department will continue to search from 6:30 am on 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation as compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member is the lowest in the country in July this year, with only 0.71 votes in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 votes in Kagoshima Prefecture.
In the first oral argument held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the defendant's prefectural election manager asked for a rejection of the claim as "not even though it was in a significant inequalities as to the extent that there was a problem of constitutionality."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

On the night of the 28th, the unmanned spacecraft "Konotori" 8 (JAXA), carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) of about 400 kilometers altitude, arrived near the station, and the astronauts during their stay operated the robotic arm.
The resupply aircraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the speed difference and closes to about 10 meters away.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters in length is a flow that grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching to the station, the flight crew carries the luggage.
Mexican drug cartel executives, one third of the drug in the united states
Shortly after the sunrise of Chicago Westside, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Control Authority (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
Last year in Chicago, nearly 800 people died of overdose.
McNight said that 90% of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named Nemecio Servantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Mexican agent Matthew DonahewDEA said, "Mencho is DEA and, indeed, the top priority of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $1 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug production sites at El Mencho in the dense forest were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartels, Harrisco Nueva, are involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel has sold "massive" cocaine, methane fetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck has a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and returned to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels.
It owns a large amount of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said that he actually owns his own special maneuvers.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders have occurred due to drug cartels fighting.
According to the Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occur a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic, so it is necessary to wear protective clothing when handling.
At the manufacturing base, the bags of cocaine are engraved with the sealant.
More than one third is expected to be made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that virtually capture the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone died, Donahew said that it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news, PS4 games, oldfashioned
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent state of play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to Last of As.
Some of the video games of this new action game were showcased by fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in various ways.
Since the time of PSwan, the last of the as part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense from the previous work, the story is magnificent and complicated," said Doracman.
And it was necessary to tell stories that had so many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game did not enter a single blue ray, and it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it does not ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic notic dogs.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 only on PS4, you will see a lot more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
In October 2019, Sony recently announced a free PS4 game for PlayStation Plus, including the aforementioned Notic Dogs.
The MLB The Show 19 will be released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like the Last of As Remasterd and want to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced multiple versions of the game, including popular character Erie backpacks and bracelet replicas and bonus versions with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Hidekaru" Council attempts Residents wish to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops declined due to the aging of the population, mobile sales began by the Notoshima Regional Development Council, which was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagons with daily necessities, seasonings, and food ran over the Suso-chokai and Hanura-chokai on the first day.
Some of the products were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and the residents asked for continued "helping" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, a total of vegetables such as potato salad and kinpira gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Susomachi-kai, the population was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83), who is usually shopping with his husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope he will continue."
Users also received orders such as "I want you to bring coffee that you don't have canned coffee, but I want you to do it yourself."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to save "shopping weak."
By December, the 20-machi-kai in the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether it will continue as a business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed his decision to provide additional assistance of approximately $1 billion to drought-stricken residents.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by droughts have been extended, and existing farm allowances are greatly reviewed for simplicity.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-affected resident support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will be provided with a maximum of $100 million for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion as a drought support.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing four of Steven and Katie Stay and five children.
According to the authorities, on July 9, 2014, Haskell was pushed into the residence of Stay and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was located.
Melanie was absent, but she had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13-year-old and four-year-old son, nine-year-old and seven-year-old daughter died.
Only one person and fifteen-year-old Cashy Stay survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but it recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed the innocence of Ronald Lee Haskell's heart loss.
The jury was dismissed from prison until Monday.
"If you choose to disappoint us, never forgive us."
Is the appeal of a girl who was angry with her voice echoed by the local leaders?
Global warming is becoming more serious.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York City, Swedish 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike all over the world.
The young people who raised anxiety and irritability protested all over the world, including Japan.
It is expected that about 4 million people participated in more than 150 countries.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will start full-scale in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century, and to reduce global warming by less than twice before the Industrial Revolution.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed countries and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to be associated with global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is frequently observed in various places.
In order to improve global warming at a faster pace, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit, which was realized by the call of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal to virtually zero by 50 years.
Other 70 countries raised their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
The Minister of Environment, Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at an environmental meeting, said at a meeting on climate change issues, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal does not deny, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no resistance to Mr. Greta, who is now a symbol of environmental movement.
The scars that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "replacement of issues" that the person opposes.
There is no longer a limit to global warming measures, and the international community must respond to a common crisis.
There is no sufficient effectiveness for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act without taking away that future.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The U.S. Army's research results led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may allow us to secure military safety, measure and measure time functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute distributed quantum information center of the United States Army Combat Capability Development Department, which is funded by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between matter and light - 50 km away using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state and the measurement is performed on one side, even if the other quantum bits are physically distant, the measurement results are affected by the other.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is also a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Dr. Ben Lañon, an experimental physicist at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
It can be said that the intercity quantum network consists of a network of physical quantum bit points in entangles despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of the quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale distributed entangling," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum network use.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Dr. Lañon.
The team then sent the light particles first through non-linear crystals with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, which is the standard wavelength of the current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a fiber optic cable 50 km long.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangled network in long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle watch network is a very important field for the Army from the perspective of accurate positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications."
