Croatia's nuclear treatment facility plan, Bosnian people protest
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and protested the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in the town of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the barracks in Trugovska Gola and to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote "Don't take a healthy future," and "We need to stop it."
We must oppose it.
The head of the municipality of Novi Grad, Miloslav Driaka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko nuclear power plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or to pay the cost of the waste of Croatia that Slovenia would be treated at newly constructed facilities.
Croatian Minister of Environmental Protection and Energy, Tomislav Chorich, told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents of the country claimed Croatia to look for another construction site on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket, that is, the Trugovska gola, be the best place in Croatia?"
Don't let us hurt our self-esteem!

What is the representative Munchhausen syndrome that appeared in The Politician of Netflix?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are sick.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is the story of Patton Hobert, who wants to be President of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinness Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, despite the fact that humans under their protection are not seriously ill.
There are various types of diseases, but there are also munhhausen syndromes that are hypothesized to be a disease of themselves.
However, the representative Munchhausen syndrome is clearly hypothesized that others under their protection are ill.
This is also known as FII, counterfeiting or induced diseases, and is a type of child abuse.
Although it is a rare symptom, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what is the sign of the proxy Munchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following issues as a precaution.
The child is healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
I'll explain to you, or complain about false symptoms.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing that they are diabetes.
Overdose medications and other drugs can cause disease symptoms intentionally.
How general is Münchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.
what should we do if we suspect a child's damage?

Nigeria: police force the school of caduna, rescue 300 children
Kaduna - The State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
Police said that the children were placed in a humanitarian environment, but the school denied this claim.
Residents who call themselves the pastor of the school say, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
The parents came to deliver a meal to their children every day, so they knew what the environment was.
It was very surprising that the police came and evacuated the children, and that the parents had all the food they had delivered, so they closed the school.
There are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair."
He adds that the former head of the Police Agency, Abdullahman, had visited once to confirm what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
The children also learn Corlan and say that it is all.
However, police chief Yakub Savo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of getting knowledge about Corlan, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were injured on their back.
So we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

According to each commission, the gender field of the public high vows has been determined by Osaka Prefecture and Fukuoka Prefecture since 2007, and Hokkaido and Kanagawa Prefecture have decided to remove them from FY20.

Central Coast's "Super Evil Nondo" girl raped, and an order to confront victims in court.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending a school in Central Coast, Virginia.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to trees and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges of this assault and another 11-year-old girl, grooming and sexual abuse.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on the road and witnessed a man armed with a large tree branches and knives suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, stop, stop."
The man said to the girl, "Don't speak loud.
When I hear it, I can't see it."
The man had a cutlery on his right hand and the girl's hands tied in a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused for nearly an hour.
When a man broke the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man had several mobile mails and telephones from his colleagues, but did not respond, and arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m.
The man stood in the clothes of mud, grass, and trees, and was involved in street violence, and claimed that he had been chasing the driver down to the bush, and that he was around by clay.
The man's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development, based on public interests, warned IT representatives
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors that if there was no ethical assessment of public interest on Friday, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development could increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
At the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in the discussion of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increased machine work, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand, and responses by social media companies during atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away human dignity.
"If the advancement of technology causes increasingly pronounced inequality, it will not be the right true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advancements are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, we're going to reverse them into a sort of barbarian state based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to take advantage of the expertise of the participants and find the talent to be a future advisor to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.

Real Madrid's loan, players Martin Woodegor, and fan excitement with an assist.
Martín Woodegor showed a surprise support for Michel Oyalusabar.
Real Madrid won the Ossana at 2-0, renewing the undefeated record in the current domestic season, and leaping to the top of La Liga.
However, despite the lack of one game in La Liga this season, director Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure due to the intense open battle and the public discontent with the Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champigns League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda and Arabes, and was surprised by Michel Oyalusabar's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won their home base in 3-0.
Martín Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite pass through the inside of another two players to Oyalusabal to determine the goal by receiving this completely accurate slew ball.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third goal of the stunning Oyalusabar penalty spot, Alabeth's Midfiller Manu Garcia secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before the end of 5 minutes.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally achieved this territory.
Anna Hazale, and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When the lawsuit came, the name of Sharad Powerle was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerl's leadership in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The Executive Bureau of the Investigation Agency (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerll and his nephew, former Deputy Minister of State Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the Central Authority.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, accused of the name of the former chairman of the bank, Agit Powerll and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When he came to contact the lawsuit, his name was nowhere.
The executive's lawsuits and suspicions that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name came up and who mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerll, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted detailed investigations into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerll denied any fraud and claimed that it had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of a lawsuit registration just weeks before the Maharashtra parliamentary election on October 21.
The former coalition minister clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
The NCP referred to the action by the Executive Bureau as a formality.

Stop the accident!
Four Preliminary Prevention Devices - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by a driver's mistake.
In particular, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator steps by elderly drivers has been increasing.
In particular, when you start a sudden, you will be panicked, and you may want to step on the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with a safety driver support function to cover such a mistake, but there is also a rearing device that can be attached to an unattended car.
Such after-sale parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and at the same time it passes.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] To inform you of the pedal mistake from a new perspective, "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot.
It is to avoid the pedal's step mistake by using the alarm sound.
The mechanism occurs when the brake is wrong and the accelerator pedal is necessary or more when it is stopped or slow driving.
It is to react to the sound and encourage the accelerator to return, and to avoid rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the mistake.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the stepping error of the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf to hear.
The installation is attached to the OBDII connector, and the body is only attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excl. tax) and it is easy to set.
[Ashimo-no-kun] The World Wing was launched in mid-September, and the Ashimo-no-Kon was the Ashi-no-Kon, an accelerator and brake step prevention device.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without advance.
At the time of the stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is trampled rapidly, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the rapid advance.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I did not tell the signal from the accelerator, and immediately controlled the advance by turning it into a creeping state (where I left the brake in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h and force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The installation is only possible with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (tax excluded).

Ms. Suosato Kusumoto (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that the three-year-old child who liked nursery school suddenly went to nursery school after the flood damage, and was forced to stay at night.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up the house and have not had enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can't panic and say 'OK' to children."
Yukari Okushi (36) in Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families, including three-year-old children.
"If you have a child who can't stay still, you will use your mind around you."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children from 4 to 12 years old, was watered around her house.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the disaster, and I have food and simple toilets.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparations will change in family structure and housing situation."
Shinako Kawasaki (40) in Shiroishi-cho, with a child of 6 and 8 years old, proposed that " elementary school had an e-mail from the school on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or mail system.
There was also a request to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "It was okay last time."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
President Tanaka said, "I think the opinions that were issued will also be conveyed to the government as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Urcuri
The IOPC will examine whether the scandal in London's mayor's office should be investigated as a violation of criminal law.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts on acts" on suspicions that he had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"The matter of conduct exists in the presence of information indicating that crime could have been done."
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The issue was entrusted to the IOPC, but IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations issued by the police in England and Wales.
The issue was entrusted to the police authority because Johnson was in a position comparable to the police commissioner at that time.
Johnson denied fraud related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, despite claiming that he was "constitutional."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but the press reported that the Americans who had moved to London seven years ago were paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the mayor's reign, and that Johnson and others were given preferential treatment to join the foreign trade delegation three times.
Since then, the government has frozen a £100,000 grant to the hacker house, the company of Mr. Curi during the investigation.
The company will be asked questions about the survey process conducted before the grant is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British telephone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Curi (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among the employees."
The movement of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities touched the anger of the Prime Minister's office.
Government officials say that this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the previous night of the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"In any case, the supervisory authority did not submit any evidence, and the prime minister had no opportunity to answer the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late Friday night."
The public and the mass media will see the political Kyogen that was organized by the people.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Tourism and Regional Promotion Division was "public secret."
The former staff of London & Partners (L&P) said that although there were people who thought that the company was "unreliable" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany the trade-related talks abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Sawakami Sunobu.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
What are you feeling now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all those involved, not to the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, it was the "Sawakami Fund" that stood up with the desire to support the formation of property for general consumers.
This spirit remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from the anxiety of money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operation will not be performed unless you walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges like the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" has many money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have said since our time, "We will support companies that are needed in the world."
We believe that this is the reason why we became a long-term fund for 20 years and that we continued to be a direct sales system that delivered messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc miller's death, the third drug arrester is the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - Last year, the third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing phenthanyl before Miller accidentally took over cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl and died last September.
Walter is accused of supplying drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Pettyt was getting drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Libis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, was accused of delivering drugs to Pettyt as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for the 2005 drug case, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The prosecutors in charge of the case, first reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, requested that Walter be detained until the trial began due to the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to the phone call message to the lawyer.
Petitt was prosecuted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defenders refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics include a frank word about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, but was defeated in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video to his Instagram and published a song about Miller, called "Sancue Next."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died related to opioid drug abuse in recent years.
The rock band Three Doors Down guitarist Matthew Roberts died of drug overdose in 2016 and found Fentanil and Hydrocodon in the body.
This article corrected Walter's spelling of the name Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hidden game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime, and stories on and off-line.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats coming out of hiding places.
He studied how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that "we spend time making games when bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged five to fifteen.
The course hosted by Codefest International was introduced to give children such as Basil a chance to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in numerous mobile games.
"Since Basil always had a mobile phone and had a game, he bought a tablet when he was four.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did pretty well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, he became interested in the game production.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a bit angry," he said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but how do you make games yourself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basil, who had been interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has the name of his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The African youth population is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is made, the young generation like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds have been awarded a robot that uses program code to separate housework.
In May, the women's high school team and Akrobot won the 2019 Robofest competition.
Google and Microsoft giant technology companies have increased African investment, and Basil-chan and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
the former chairman of the North Carolina Republicans, a false testimony from the bribery investigation
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman faked federal investigators who conducted corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court's case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' attorneys, Hayes was aware of false statements by FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Haze will accept.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor charged with the involvement of former Haze's former legislators in the insurance company's plan to fund the election contributions to the state's insurance director.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery of Mike Cozy.
Lindbergh, founder of insurance and investment companies, has donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016, and has become the state's top political donor in recent years.
Lindberg supported Republican philosophy and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer asked him to comment on Friday and email, but he did not respond.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the defendant's lawyer, requested an additional comment by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he did not speak with Corsey about the State Insurance Bureau staff.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindberg's request for a meeting with Cozy, and also met with the director about direct bribes.
The prosecution, published in April, claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his own insurance business, and was planning to raise $2 million to campaign for Cozy's 2020 reelection.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindberg's company.
Republican Corsey reported alleged attempted bribes to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no doubts.
In an indictment, it is described in a conversation, including Lindbergh and Cozy, that Lindberg co-owners instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would pay attention if he could move so expensive money, but he eventually broke out in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "Anything you want."
i know, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office requested an e-mail to provide detailed information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like other people's posts!
This change, following the launch of a similar test in Instagram in Australia in July, liked! became personal and only posted.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy director Mia Garrick said that this change was based on feedback from mental health experts that would cause happiness surveys and goodies!
Garlic said, "There was a very positive feedback from a number of cooperative bullying groups and mental health groups."
It is only to remove numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange, rather than the number of good or reaction.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick said that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
It is very early to test in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when this test ends or changes.
"There were initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, who is in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very active Facebook and Instagram user.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got the most favorite bag of my mother and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was a part of Cando's handicraft that helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying i'm not selling anymore...
Her mother's broken bag, the jaw is the ultimate Petit Plasma.
Therefore, if you ask the shop for repairs, the price of the main body was significantly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up.
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for the replacement of this connected fitting.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be 100 percent.
It seems to be a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
We purchased two bags each at each end of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you put it along with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This opened the way to bag repair.
It is a smooth installation.
don't worry!
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
But because the ring size is small, the movement is poor ...
So I decided to make the ring a couple.
The number of fittings increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight is not a problem at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts has increased and the level has been improved in design.
The express "Aso" of the National Railways is a temporary train to Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for the departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train with the image of the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28th
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era
A temporary train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded 12 blue passenger cars from Hiroshima Station and left Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destiny Campaign" by JR companies, a tour was organized.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, running the Sanyo, Chikuto and Kagoshima lines.
A special headmark was drawn by Mt. Aso.
his brother was sentenced to life in the honor of a Pakistani social media star, kandir baroch.
Candy Baroch, who gained fame in his photos posted on social media, was hanged in July 2016.
His older brother, the popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the most attention of his father, Pakistan.
In July 2016, Mr. Balochi, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, was strangled.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
He said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, "Of course," and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardahl Mamoud, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan in the eastern city was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
The lawyer said, "Inshirar, the thought of God, will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Baroch's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that he wanted his son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Baroch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of his misrepresentation of the laws of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "principal murders."
In the case of Mr. Baruche, the woman chooses her own marriage partner, she burns herself with crimes such as praise for her sexuality and insults her family.
The murder is usually carried out by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow perpetrators to be pardoned from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorable homicide.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can claim another motive in theory and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted that his son be pardoned.
However, the sad parents thought they would lose their son and said they wanted to change their mind and forgive their son.
With the international dislike of killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
His famous actions include the offer of a strip show to the Pakistani cricket team and the wearing of a bright red dress with a wide open chest on Valentine's Day.
Although it became critical and threatening, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the new heavens and earth were opened in a country considered to be a political activity to improve the status of women boldly to express themselves as a presence like Kim Kardashian.
The origins of the "priority" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely throughout South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

In addition to actively cooperating in projects conducted by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both groups mediate, dispatch, and share information when training related to sports.
When a team of remote islands travels outside the island, they work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of the trainer in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in cooperation with the prefectural competitions and other national competitions, we will support the team to prevent the decrease in performance of the athletes due to fatigue on board trips and nights.
In addition, during the competition on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players who came from outside the island by cooperating with local recoil clinics and hospital officials.

Kenichiro Mogi: "Now, the era of "traditional common sense breaks."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice about "mote."
The brain science theory is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), the non-mote otoko stick to the traditional "man's fantasy" and the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool, mote man.
if you're bound by what you should do, you're going to live.
In the first part, since "coolness" always evolves, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and behavior of people.
When you learn patterns, you will be able to live in a rake because the brain systemizes the behavior.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I'm "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
Since I was teaching at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you're stuck with an old pattern that says, "The teacher at university is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say what you should do or what you should do, you will survive.
Because people and society change even if they don't change.
I've been talking about that in my recent talk book, Live - No matter how terrible the world is.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by admitting that person.
He doesn't want to be light.
It's painful to ask yourself around.
How did you do that at the Cannes Film Festival?
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness" you can't be light.
As long as I hear a lot of women, regardless of their position or age, it seems to be a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to find out what this "cute" is.
what is it?
In the illegal state of northwestern Nigeria, the number of refugees doubled to 40,000: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 due to increased violence in the last four months.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis was created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, each institution cooperated to raise funds for $35.5 million.
The UNHCR spokesman Babar Barok said that the Islamic extremist organization Boko Haram, which has been active in anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Nigeria in the last 10 months was caused by organized armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok said on Friday to the press.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, assault, murder and sexual violence have occurred frequently, and that raiders have destroyed residences and thefts.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoham and the West African branch of the Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with the name of the group."
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the coming months.

Header binding is a mechanism that allows the media to deliver high-priced ads to media operated by media by fair bidding competition with multiple bidders.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
In the past, SSP has been provided through the advertising framework.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frames with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase advertising frames in response to advertisers' requests.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header bindings allow them to participate in direct header bids in the target advertising frame, which is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, due to the limited number of media companies being targeted, the advertising framework for the distribution sites along with individual commercial materials and brand images is secured, preventing brand value damage.
One of the advantages of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each Bedder company called "Lapper Solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, will enable efforts to meet the expectations of the introduction of media companies.

Two months of suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that an assistant professor in his 30s working at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment was the same date.
According to the Department of General Affairs, in October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, male assistants were emotional, and they repeated oppressive behavior such as insulting in inappropriate words, giving strong emotional stress.
He was a teacher of education and recognized that the school environment deteriorated.
A survey conducted in September 18 reported several students.
In December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and in December of the same year, the faculty of the Yonezawa Campus conducted an investigation to prevent harassment.
In response to the findings from the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the board members decided to disciplinary action.
After the survey, the male assistant professor continued to receive education, but through the interview, the previous actions were improved, and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deep sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to take all my studies to prevent harassment and work to restore confidence."
The university also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students led by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts Requests to Boris Johnson to reduce the EU withdrawal demands and to make compromises with the EU The Sun Paper
Now that only three weeks have passed since the EU summit meeting, there has been growing concerns around the prime minister that the prime minister might not be able to make significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in EU withdrawal requests and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are packed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "impossible."
The senior ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose a compromise proposal, such as a three-year time limit on the backstop, to the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to confront the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They demand that the Prime Minister abandons the "extreme" strategy that threatens the EU devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings without agreement, and insists that the EU will accept the offer to withdraw in limited time.
One Cabinet member said that the ruling that the Supreme Court's closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday would be "the alarm," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his steps.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and the Camings project is clearly failing.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to carry out the pre-Prime Minister's proposal, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I'm going to tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many things that everyone is trying to end.
If we fail to postpone, Boris will end and we will end.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a harsh speech, said: "The prime minister wants to connect with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting the bulls, inspecting the eggs in the seales, and discussing with the people in the streets.
The prime minister's press acknowledged yesterday that the agreement is still a long time ahead, and said, "If anyone does not think of it, the journey is still long."
However, the press also said that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month postponement if it does not agree, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that the bill has hindered our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are trying to continue their progress hard despite the passage of the bill."
The European Union Delegation Minister Stephen Berkeley returned to Brussels today to discuss further with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorain Kelly: I was told that the Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, revealed that he was told by the bosses of the television station that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, 59 years old, said he was very nervous.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Ann Diamond and Mike Morris interviewed legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as the living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter of the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV and ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named after her.
To celebrate the 35th anniversary, she will broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
"The passion and enthusiasm" and "the curiosity" were the key to survival in the television industry, and the moderator said, "You have to put it in your work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck her heart, Kelly revealed that it was "very painful" to report on the Danbulane shooting.
The next day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't even think we were watching many of the families of the children who were killed or wounded who broadcast the show live from Danbulane.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna, told me to personally meet me, so we had to talk for hours at her house.
Not taking all of it on the show, I went to Joanna funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McKan's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple are not really sorry.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 am on Monday, September 30.
i was afraid of the Zimbabwe trap.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of the presidency from the late President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to anxiety that it might be a trap that would lead to military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give the presidency, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the defense forces.
However, Chiwenga declined the offer because he saw the intention of Mugabe to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders of all over the world and the African Union that he was deprived of the regime in a coup, rather than from anxiety.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, officials confirmed that he was a senior official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has held the administration for 37 years, is willing to give the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munngawa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, tried to contact the envoy to Chiwenga.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three.
President Spokesman George Chalanba, and his senior officials said that Arron Nepera, the top representative of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, and Fidelis Muconoli, the Roman Catholic bishop, were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was one commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Chiwenga alone.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, failed to attempt to condemn the African Union's actions while seeking intervention by leaders of African countries.
The offer to give the presidency to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the choice of the former president.
"Some of the late president's family began to suffer from fatigue, and it was an abandoned act to save the rapidly expanding situation as dangerous as possible," he wrote.
However, at least diplomatically, there was a little political aim of the late president to change the flow.
If there was anything to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I would like to remind you that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and not be defeated.
The late President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top military officer of the time, would trap and destroy the claims of the commanders claiming that he did not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe wanted the African Union to decide whether to position the entire situation as a coup without grasping enough, but ultimately to call it a coup, and that the military intervention request would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe would have to write his resignation.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the President's residence, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that point, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders at that time read the intent accurately.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa (which we belong to the military) " were used in the words of an envoy to convey the desperate message of the president, and the government officials said that there was a strong metaphorical expression that "if we were not politicians, there was no political competition."
The Army told the other military commanders of the region that through the military officers who stayed in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munangaguwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at that time, the key South Africans in this process refused to intervene, but as they repeatedly threatened behind it, it was clear that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, it didn't come to fruition," he said.
The United Nations Appeals for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons The ratification of the treaty in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[New York Joint] On the 26th, a meeting was held at the UN headquarters in New York to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.
The new five countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and ratified it in 32 countries and regions.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern in recent years that there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is no other way to eliminate it."
China needs strong leadership.
Before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complicated, but there are few political issues.
Without a unified strong leadership, China will go to division and collapse, and will be a disaster for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing the problem in a rigid manner, like the suppression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989 as needed for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he held the government in late 2012.
Mr. Xi has also directed a military modernization program that threatens the region.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development model, nor does it intend to adopt a model of other countries, but rather merely seek peace.
Among the genes of the Chinese people, there is no aggression or world control.
In modern times, China was bullied by a strong column, and war and confusion left a deep scar with that pain; China would never give the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in China's Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never abandon its nuclear interests and will not allow the loss of security and sovereignty.
"The tariffs that continue to rise with the threat of trade war are nothing to solve any problem," says White Paper in connection with the trade dispute with Washington.
China is a mature economic state with a complete industrial system, complete industrial chain, wide market space and momentum of strong economic development.
"It will never weaken in the trade war."
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities, and opening a new world.
The United States should consider China's development calmly, as China has no idea to counter the U.S. and does not want to replace the US.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, oppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko.
Yokohama Taka, a famous high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masaru Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as a coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will be determined promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that local newspapers had a rumor about baseball players.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's neck and the director Kaneko admitted some of the rumors.
In addition, based on the results of the questionnaire survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and the fact was generally accepted and dismissed on 28 December.
In the summer of 15th, Motochika WATANABE (74), who was raised by Daisuke MATSUSAKA (present-day Nakanichi) and others, retired.
He became the director of Hirata and the director of Kaneko.
In the summer of the 16th century, he participated in Kokoen in the summer for three consecutive years.
However, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals this summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in autumn, and the Senbatsu tournament in next spring was hopeless.
The Spice Girls' MelC, the Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage, and the Diet's topic at home is prohibited.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, who had been unable to eat anything other than fruits and vegetables for many years, admitted that diet was banned at home.
With the pressure of a global pop group, sporty spices have been "excess exercise" for many years without having enough meals, and have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by the child rearing of his beloved daughter Scarlett, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old, and I'm getting distracted by my own appearance."
But because I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when I talked with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's customs.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, still in front of SNS Taito, Mel said in an interview with Women's Health magazine that "heavy" comments about himself in the press led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out a certain food group, got more and more exercised, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted almost a few years."
Judiciary judgment of same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's decision was made to acknowledge the fact that 'the marriage (internal marriage)' in accordance with marriage was a dispute between the same sex.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, and there is no legal effect in the country.
The decision was based on the fact that two women were married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to admit legal protection to the same-sex couples.
There are five legal cases in which the same-sex marriage is not recognized due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Register Act, which require compensation to the country as unconstitutional.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss how the legal system should recognize various families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years, and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The ruling recognized the fact that "the reality of marriage between men and women is not the same" from the results of living together.
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of marriage with the right to marriage in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of which marriage is based solely on the agreement of the two sexes.
Both sexes were "unprecedented at the time of the establishment, because same-sex marriage was not expected, it is not clear to the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
"The Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," but it is expected that it will be a driving force for the same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, the problem was that "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women."
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while recognizing the same reality as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, 70% of the people who believed that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law have changed their consciousness.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if the law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who cannot afford it.
In fact, marriage is not a spouse who admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the absence of joint custody.
In the examination of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family laws from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriage between the same sexes but also the expansion of legal rights for marriage in fact.
to the trial and jury trial of the former athlete who was prosecuted for rape
A jury trial of former Delaware University baseball players prosecuted for sexual assaults by several women is held.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
The 21-year-old woman stated that she had been sexually assaulted after sending her to her home by car.
After three weeks of meeting with Bumble, they sent their nude photos to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecutors argued that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defenses have argued that women's paradoxical claims and memory differences may have regretted having physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure, "It's the next season that I took Penangt" (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final round of the season, and the possibility of his own entry into the CS failed.

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, the videos revealed
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest contributor to the opera house, the Mercury Key, the Lunar Park, and the famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 cups of pollutants flow through the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title, "From Sydney Harbor to Down," the waterways around the most popular cities in Australia have a lot of suckers, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all of which are flowing through rainwater into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, the biggest factor to clog the waterway is plastic.
Dr. Katherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbor Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
Although its appearance is certainly beautiful, it is one of the most polluted estuary of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastics per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow through rainwater drains into Sydney Harbour.
"The heavy rains were falling several times, but Sydney Harbor was pretty tragic," Dr. Duffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road.
However, in a corner of the iceberg, 70 percent of the plastics that flow into the ocean are deposited in the seabed under the water surface of the Sydney Harbour.
"I don't really know what the truth is if I don't go down the sea level," said Dave Center Manley, owner Richard Nichols, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is under the water surface), I think everyone will be really cool.
Over half of what we find is plastic bags.
The remaining half is used in plastics at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone can't believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing down the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of Ocean Protect, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce the amount of plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the use of plastics, recycles more well, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a source of food.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it back to the old days, but it's very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study of plastics and mental health was also presented this month, as part of the activities of the Australian public to widely know about environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new survey, 82 percent of the 546 children between 12 and 18 have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
The study also stated that 93 percent of the 551 parents surveyed were increasingly concerned about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
Former Karatsu Power Station in October | Saga News | Saga Newspapers
The construction of the former Karatsu power plant began in October, and the chimney of the former Karatsu power plant started.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) located in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantling was used to drain gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
Each chimney is split from top to bottom with a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
There was a sad voice, and a man in his 60s who ran a restaurant nearby said, "When I saw a chimney coming back from afar, it was like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because the prefecture's Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station are nearby, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.
Product development with local fish Owashi Taka Fish nuggets and other sales Mie - Ise Shimbun

[Owase] Four third-year students of the Prefectural Owase High School Information Business Department of Kodono-cho, Owase City, Mie Prefecture developed fish naggets and rice cooked in Thailand using fish caught in the local area.
It was sold at the school's cultural festival on 26th.

Classes began in June.
They visited factories in Owashi and deepened their understanding of the water industry.
At the workshop, we talked about consumer needs and tried prototypes.
He also invented naggets using hydrangeas, but because of the smell of fish, he adopted mutz.
Mr. Masaki Yamaguchi (17) said, "It's a product that can be eaten by people who are not good at fish, and I'm glad that many people can eat it."
It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell their products.
I am now (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Mayo Takahashi, a free announcer and a monthly commentator on CBC TV "Chat!," told his master.
the advice of the master who saved the rotten self
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a master beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
It is different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was struck by being said to be a conne or a bliss, my father said, "I thought it was a conne, but I didn't think it was.
After that, when I joined the company in the second or third year, I was only working "Anyone who is an empty girl is good" and I didn't get motivated because I didn't want to do my job, but when my heart was rotting, "Who can do it is good job, but I asked Mama, but I was glad to be in charge of it.Next, I decided to appoint Mama"I changed my mind more than once.
i learned naturally from my father's acting.
There may be many people who haven't seen me reading the news, but since I joined the TV station, I've been in touch with the news all the time with the narration of BS and news shows.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe was happy and confident that he was "very good at reading Mama news."
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sensed.
It has been cultivated through watching father's stage, movies, TVs, and period dramas in childhood.
In other words, I think it was thanks to my father because I have a lot of experiences in my childhood.

The World Rally Championship was held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round was held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at the past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is WRC that will revive in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships that are governed by the FIA, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, it has been held every year to become the world's highest rally championship with a history and tradition, and it is said that the competition will be the toughest car competition because it runs fast on various roads such as gravel and snow roads as well as closed roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparatory Committee was established to host the event.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.) and Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation), both governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work hard to achieve the success of the 2020 Fall Games in cooperation with relevant parties so that we can make a big appeal to the world as the center of motorsports representing Japan."
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports competition for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you today."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very pleased to be able to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motorsports, commented on the Japanese round.
The Japan round of the WRC World Rally Championship will be held from November 19 to 22, 2020.

The main venue is the "Love and Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exhibition.
In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is it the key to cancer treatment?
Tusmaniadeville may have the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could bring great reforms to patient treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells were camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurred in Tasmania and humans.
It is hoped that this discovery will create new ways to treat cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCall Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to tackling fatal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags used a series of proteins called PRC2 to camflage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and Merkel cells.
Peter McClumn researcher Mark Dowson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Reuse traditional therapies, revitalizing markers, i.e. proteins known as MHC, may enable the immune system to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Doson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it can be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where cancer cells escape detection.
"Unfortunately, the exact same process occurs in the cancer of humans and Tasmanian devils."
"Until now, it was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmaniadeville.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may help control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by a giant planet orbiting a tiny star
Scientists have discovered and amazed the solar system that orbits a giant Jupiter-type planet around a small star called Red dwarf, 30 light-years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting the red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
But in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, the Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies, led by this research published in Science, said.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using telescopes at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why it's red."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet could have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining the elliptic orbit of its Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust that created the star itself orbiting.
The most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, causes the object from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes the atmosphere by pulling the egg from the planet.
A conflict model called a self-gravity instability model may explain this rare planetary system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature might have been lower."
As the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant bean dip, was eaten by his colleagues and charged.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating dipping beans with awakening agents to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of the transfer of methane fetamine, a Class B felony, and suspected of taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit from OregonLive.com, a suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked him to taste a bit because Medina Hernández saw he was making a bean dip.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returns to work, her stomach gets worse and her legs swelled.
According to Albanie Democrat Herald, at a local hospital where women went, it was judged that soy dip could contain methane phetamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández "was told the victim's food that he had put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message stating that he had accidentally put methane phetamine into the beans dip.
According to the Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows that Medina Hernández turned back to the camera and clinched behind the microwave, but pulled something out of the brager.
It is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table to put a dip of beans in a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was detained in Marion County prison instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gunn, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has been a criminal record of assault, robbery, sneezing, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

My job as a mother was almost always to find the children who wanted to be, and to keep them in a reasonable distance to grow.
To find out who they are, in essence, they are not the ideals for children as parents or the admiration of their childhood.
Mrs. Obama, who really knows the pressure on spotlights in the world, advised Duchess little by little in the interview of Good Housekeeping.
sometimes the pressure from yourself and the people around you can feel too big.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't have time to do anything.

Trump Hotel owner's right to complain, but also the liquor sales license holds.
Washington (AP) - The Washington Alcohol and Beverage Board of Directors in Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the local Trump International Hotel's license to sell alcoholic beverages because of the question of the owner's suitability.
On Wednesday, three members, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, it is the second time that an appeal to the cancellation of the hotel's alcohol right is made based on a state law requiring the applicant's "suitability" to obtain a liquor license.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year included repeated deceptions against President Trump's assault and violating state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time that an appeal was made to update the permit.

Peter Bosch, executive officer in the manufacturing department of Bentley, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we set up a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant this year.
The beekeepers watched how honey bees are gathering from wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers through its Crew Plants and our business.
The staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the harvest volume of betray honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to carry out various initiatives to fulfill our role." In May 2019, 12 million bees of bees, Flying Bees, started.
In September of the same year, over a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator, and after filtering the fallen honey, it was bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like attention.
The label was designed by Louise McClum, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also given to the important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
I would like to enjoy afternoon tea, not only Fennelty which is compatible with honey, but also honey from Flying Bees such as corn.
it's the worst of the u.K. in the scandalous Cleveland police report.
The police arrested him for the worst time in the UK.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continued to be "a serious deterioration," says Phil Gomley.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to stop the crime, arrest the suspect and protect the socially vulnerable.
Phil Gomley, Director of the Police Bureau, said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Police chief Mike Vil resigned in January, less than a year before his appointment, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee of the Corruption for the reason that he had done sexual acts to his colleagues.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Interior Ministry intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr said he was a criminal, and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what's going on.
At present, we believe we are involved in the case of a cover-up, which may take some time to investigate," said Pelosi in Congress to interview CNN.
"We're going to do what we're doing, based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," said Pelosi.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump commissioned Ukrainian President Vladimir Zerensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, the candidate for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zerensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudi Giulani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security lawyer in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before formal inquiries.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not extend to the investigation of political fund violations.
In response to the question that Mr. Bar should testify, Pelosi said Friday that the intelligence special committee decided to ask who to testify.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was always included," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's name in the July telephone talks with the Ukrainian president.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make decisions regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said he was "very concerned" about the whistleblowers who became the source of information when Trump attacked the accused on Thursday as a spy and hinted that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that the whistleblower plays an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to the whistleblowers is a significant loss of the margins within the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about the suspicions that he had tried to pressure foreign leaders for political profits, and wrote a historical step.
The call was included in the accusations published on Thursdays, and the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office in the next 2020 presidential election to seek intervention in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that the White House advisors instructed officials to remove calls from the cabinet-grade computer system and replace them with special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Bentek, nonstop driving in violation of speed
The Premier League star, Christian Bentek, who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, was banned from driving.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old forward allowed her to drive her Bentley on January 20, and to drive 50 miles per hour at a speed limit of A3 in Richmond, southwest London.

In early July, Bentek pleaded guilty of these two violations under a single trial procedure, in which one of the magistrates tried and sentenced him to light crimes.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the judging committee
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the next Ghana Football Association (GFA) election.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davis and expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA Sports, Mr. Manu said that the chairman was interested in the outcome of the judging process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should be composed of fair and neutral members from outside who have no relationship with each member or have no interest before.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that his commission should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if the Olympic Committee member Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after the ceremony held at the GFA Accra Secretariat on September 19 and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis, Chairman of the Corporate Governance Consultants, and Mr. Marian Baranoa, a lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Akpocavi, a sports director.
The survey of the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture believe that the target of raising the minimum wage is "prepaid 1,000 yen."
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% of new graduates and mid-career regular employees.
The number of companies who answered "approved" was 100 percent, construction (70 and 6 percent), and wholesale (61 and 7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (51, 9 percent) and service industries (60 and 9 percent), including food and drink, and lodging.
The representative of the meeting said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with a high part and a high salary."
According to the company's response, the average payable amount was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
After hearing the hiring status of the company in March 2007, the hiring of new graduates was 61 and 3 percent, mid-term employment was 54 and 5 percent, and non-regular employees were 15 and 4 percent.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number was 44 and 7 percent, 50 and 3 percent, and non-regulars remained 31 and 1%.
In particular, transportation (particularly 13 and 3 percent of new graduates, 37 and 5 percent) and construction (24, 1 percent of new graduates, 38 and 1 percent of midway) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% had challenges in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the company's reputation was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (department within three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15-3 percent of the country's sub-sector and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied, "It is already approved."
In addition to 20 and 3% of the "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the overall acceptance attitude was expressed.
Companies that do not admit were 64 and 4%, with construction (82 and 8 percent), retail (73 and 1 percent), and manufacturing (72 and 7 percent).
The survey was conducted between July 19 and August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) answered.

Justin Tiprick said that Wales would host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Walladés, he will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will probably be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory was the 14th win against Wales, Tiprick and his team would be the best line for England.
"It's natural, I want to challenge both teams and win at the top of the group."
Until now, the fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last autumn.
I think Australia will be blamed for returning the loan, but I will do my best to win it again.
I knew this game was a mountain before I came here.
And I came here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales had only one victory in the previous World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the total score for the 3rd Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight Team was only seven in 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the November Test Match Australia match last year, but Tiprick included several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
I'm sure the game was tough, and maybe we thought we should win, but I don't know.
As a result, I had a total of 15 points in the final game, so it seemed that the score was far less than actually."
To win Wales, the key is the break-down battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Back Law.
Up until now, Tiprick has played 67 international matches, and has been fighting several matches or both players in the past, and knows what is waiting for.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you're going to face tough games.
They are always the best in the world.
I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in the defensive battle, and Michael is an aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when needed.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself, even if I'm not strong.
If you want to fight with the best opponent, and if you want to play against the two, you have to do it well.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important match for us.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose on the momentum.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from comedians?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said in a press conference on July 22 that "the company does not have any talent in 9 or so at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the curators protested.
If the ratio of "9:1" is 90% to Yoshimoto, it is considered that there was a gift from comedians to Yoshimoto, and the view of investors who were paying taxes is also streamed on Twitter.
If the Gala deal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was asked by Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not the subject of gift tax in the first place.
If it was "9:1," Yoshimoto's sales will be 1 million yen and expenses will be 10 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you are wondering about allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount you received is declared as sales.
If the person who gave the gift does not recognize it, it would not be a gift if the person was an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) away from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as this time, no third party will decide on how much tax appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen's payment statement is a poison.
Mr. Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working as a bank, he was registered as a tax accountant in 2008.
University lecturers, seminars, writing and other activities are extensive.
It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for accounting beginners.
the white house, a panic without impeachment.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and detailed officials in this issue explained that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have been increasing concerns, anxiety, and worries about the possibility that the appeal of the whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't really know what's happening."
The White House officials joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, or that the fact that the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter before could not be applied was so serious that they were not convinced how to proceed, "It seems not to be erased from the news reported next."
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" because the President's response to this impeachment was delayed and the prospect of being "incompetent" increased.
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the President is expected to be raised every day, and some close associates of the President are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has spurred concerns about the increasingly unpredictable actions and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about President and Politics in the environment of election years.
In his presidential term, Trump faced the greatest threat ever before, reviving his strategy that he judged effective during the Russian investigation by Robert Morler, and changing his hands to the attackers or to the defenses.
Trump tried to lighten the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate with the investigation of the political opponents, disinterested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for the factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the Mora investigation, but this time they began to feel the difference.
The President, who is said to be a brand, said that he seemed to be in the press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers have been aware of the fact that they did not have direct information on the call with President Trump, Vladimir Zerensky, and Ukrainian presidents, who have been controversial, claiming that they would undermine the credibility of the whistleblower and are convinced that damage could be reduced.
Furthermore, it often happens when the President is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, Republican strategic families, close to the White House, point out that the basic support rate of the President is already very high and the effectiveness of impeachment to acquire new supporters is not much.
In particular, if the impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those claiming impeachment could help the President did not fully understand how uncertain the response of the President would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to the officials who explained the plan, this initiative is still in the early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the strategic decision room will be implemented.
However, this person said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations activities aggressively in order to counter the momentum that the publication and publication of critical internal accusations had given the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible, such as the statement that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Steven Munshins would not be able to publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president after 48 hours.
According to the person involved in this case, the person who could be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump, and Corrie Luwandowski, who was the head of the former Electoral Countermeasures Headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we haven't talked with the president or close adviser about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment efforts.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmet Frad, who was involved in Clinton's impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Morler investigation, left the White House legal adviser Pat Ciporon with less experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
For more information on the White House's strategy, he said, in general, that the parties are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but aware that it is necessary to be organized and capable of leading the collective efforts and political struggle.

Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that "Let's get married in the future."
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from distant love are minority.
Nikkei Doors Editor (hereinafter - -) C is in a distant relationship with a boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "the distance is tested and the two become stronger."
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) Speaking of distance love, it is famous for a survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered), but according to the data, only 16% of couples from distance love to marriage.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touching), smelling (or smelling), kissing (taste).
However, in the case of distant love, there are cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep in touch with the auditory situation only.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to an opponent's house, you will be burdened with time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if you're on a holiday to heal the tiredness of your work, your body will be cumbersome.
When I go home, I feel relaxed.
Isn't it necessary to break up when you get far away?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently, or a couple whose distance period is determined beforehand.
I'm married a year later, or I'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult to see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Devin Nunes, a California Republican, seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, in a comment to defend the President, he accused the Democratic Party of trying to get the President nude photos.
Members of the House Information Special Committee's Republican executive Nunes filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about the internal accusations Trump had asked for the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son to investigate.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the full naked picture of the President, stating that Ukrainian suspicions were "grotesque shows" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democratic Party of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It would be natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party was so excited to impeach the President within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes, Huffpost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendeli decided to determine whether the Democratic Party was trying to find the truth.
The only response to this was the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, Jim Heizes, but many other members questioned whether the answer was a naked truth.
Mediate Dotcom speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that were written in a steel document that was controversial.
It is a notorious report by former intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected by Trump in a hotel room in Moscow looking at the urination of prostitutes and suggests existence.
Origami, wallet and real card.
Transfer, Loan, Insurance, Investment - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to pay by Origami Pay, as well as transfer money (moving) through collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they will start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services said, "We will create new financial services to solve the problems of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates," adding that "For example, we want to provide services that are equally useful and enrich people who have been alienated from finance and those who have not benefited from the system until now."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have the Origami ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get information timely.
In addition, he explained that by developing the Origami app not only on the Origami app but also on partner companies' apps, it would be possible to use the Origami app as a service.
In terms of financing, we introduced the ability to pay after-payments in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were needed suddenly, the Origami app was completed from application to repayment.
In terms of insurance, as a partner company, he introduced the insurance and first life insurance.
The two companies said they plan to use their data and knowledge to develop insurance products along the life event.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually through registration of necessary administrative agencies.
New business for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company would launch a new business that would support effective utilization of data, including data held by the company, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its payment function provided by Origami.
We recognize that effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge in partner companies that partner with Origami, such as sales, acquisition of structured data and unstructured data in real society, and accumulation, processing and analysis of such data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with payment data by its Pay and structured data owned by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.
Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies gather various data and make customer contacts," and explained, "In the next phase, how to use data to develop business models is key."
"We want to create next phase innovation by combining the data we built on the Origami Network and data from many companies."
Details of specific services will be announced sequentially.

On September 7, a ceremony was held in Aweena Osaka, Osaka City to commemorate the singer Mitoko Ogasawara, who died at the age of 100 in July.
the people involved showed the representative songs of Ogasawara
Approximately 140 Japanese people attended, including the chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Mr. Yunaga, and Mr. Yukie IKEBE, chairman of the Japan-Korea Music Arts Exchange Association.
In the ceremony, Mr. Yukie IKEBE greeted me first.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I still can't believe that the teacher has passed away."While preparing for "Remembers' Meeting," Ms. Mitsuko Ogasawara felt that he was a great and great person, and regretted his death.
On the other hand, he said, "If you can do activities that can expand the meeting even a little," he said.
After the silence was dedicated, the Messe-ji, which was sent by Mr. Kenichi Onoe of the Korea Arts Exchange Association and the International Research Institute of Chuchu thought, was introduced.
the possibility of emission reduction in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks and semis have monopolized the news, they are the only ones flying in the sky that can not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta developed a technology to enable renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as fat, livestock rendering, and canola oil from restaurants.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low-quality fats for production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude fuel, and other industrial wastes can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems in aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma that doesn't matter," Bresler said.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as biofuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Regarding the second option, Dr. Bresler said, "You can try nuclear reactors to change chemical reactions a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They expect someone to impose carbon taxes in the future."
I want to prepare a substitute for the worst case.
Currently, Foge operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a production facility of $22 million in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher in terms of fuel transport and production.
"As a technology store," says Bresler.
My job is to create an option so that multiple choices can be made in parallel with the decision given.

【High school entrance 2020】Hokkaido Public High School entrance examination and gender field of wishes are abolished (Recemam) - Yahoo! News
The Hokkaido Board of Education announced on September 26, 2019, the selection of students enrolled at Hokkaido High School in 2020.

Boris Johnson warns that if Brexit is over, the British will face riots like Los Angeles, the prime minister will call for calmness.
A senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a danger that "the violent riots by the people" would occur in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that he "nearing should be avoided" against the political words exchanged with intense speech, but argued that the term "default" would not be used.
Despite the fact that the prime minister appealed to the Times to regain his calmness, one minister said: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gile Joan or the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement -- they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and then a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King complained that the jury was innocent.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstrators with eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers noted Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if the British failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, the 10 million people would be dissatisfied."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time until tens of thousands of people go through the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first result, there would be a danger that a "strong riot by the people" would occur in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing the House Rebellion, which seeks to lower the demands for EU withdrawal and instead beat the EU in a compromise.

On the 27th, Niigata Albirex BB, a professional basketball player, prayed for victory over the B League for a week.
Niigata Albirex BB players and staff prayed for victory at Komachi Shinmeigu Shrine in Niigata City on the morning of the 27th.
Last season, Niigata won the club's first district championship.
However, after the end of the season, the scorer Davante Gardner moved to another team in the B league.
This season, with the arrival of new foreign nationals, Nick Perkins, we aim to win more than last season.
"It is important to raise the speed of the head coach's demands and the strength of the defenses more than last season," said Jun Uzawa.
The opening match of Niigata will be held on Saturday, October 5th, at Away against Albuquer Tokyo.
Pakistan, the brother of social media celebrities, was sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memories of the incident fade.
"It's too time-consuming, so people forget" women's rights activist Farzana Bali, the first gender college founder of Pakistan, said it took more than three years to solve even the Barochi incident, which has attracted attention.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "elebrated murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honorable homicides is much more than that, because it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorable homicides occurring worldwide each year are occupied by Pakistan.
11.3 billion yen countermeasures against pork cholera To add to the September correction plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo! News
It was reported by the Parliament's Board of Directors on September 26 that the prefecture would add a total of 14.8 million yen to the September supplementary budget plan, which included a total of 13.6 million yen ($136 million) for the emergency measures of pig cholera and 1,200 million yen for the decision-related expenses necessary to obtain land for the elevated JR Numazu Station.
It is proposed by the prefectural assembly on the 27th.
As a result, the total amount of general accounting for the supplementary budget for September was 81.87 million yen.
With the outbreak of a new pig cholera in Saitama Prefecture, the prefecture will expand the disinfection point of livestock carriers currently in Konishi City to three locations, including Gotemba City, Fujinomiya City, and Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City, near Kanto region.
The cost of the project was 7.7 million yen.
In addition, in order to prevent the spread of wild boars, which are the main infectious pathways, we will start measures to ensure that wild boars are not infected by pig cholera even in areas other than western prefectures.
The cost of capturing and inspecting 1560 heads in eastern and central prefectures is 58.6 million yen.
In the case of the decision-making procedure related to the elevated Numazu Station, the expenses entrusted to the evaluation of the planned site and the operating expenses associated with the holding of the subcommittee committee are added.

Floods and disruptions caused by monsoons in many areas
India's monsoon season is about a month long, an unprecedented rainfall causes buildings to collapse and death, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
The monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month increased by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, Monsoon will weaken in the most late decades.
There are still unprecedented rains in many parts of India, and the latest news is that in Pune in western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays resulted in the collapse of the building and the disaster.
The houses are flooded, and the residents are usually seen only at the height of the monsoon, crossing the street with water to their knees.
Other cities such as Corkata, Laguna and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In the northern part of the state of Uttarakand, heavy rains caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
Long-run monsoons are not desirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarakand, said, "Now we are making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but vegetables are rotting in rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pens) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also in danger.
The next big festival is Dashera on October 8th, with the Hindus setting up Ravana, an evil smile figure of a beard that appears in the huge comic book-style doll, epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the dolls are made of paper, if the Monsoon pulls long, then the last thing to laugh may be Ravana.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides and increased risk of heart disease and heart attack
The latest research shows that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared with male groups who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the research.
Dr. Rodriguez is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from over 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women and other races because it only targets Japanese-American males.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," said Dr. Rodriguez.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to aging and hiding the possible relationship between pesticides and cardiovascular diseases in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko's intervention at the zerensky Trump telephone conference
The impeachment of President Donald Trump was made, and the Washington political issue was a dramatic week.
For political beginners Vladimir Zerensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
But what has been known about the Zerensky Trump phone problem so far?
At the beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zerensky that the U.S. is more convenient to Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
The response of Zerensky, who opposed Trump 100% rather than 1000 percent, is considered controversial.
Zerensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties, argued on social media.
Former Ukrainian president Petro Poloshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for support received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he thanked the EU for its support including Russian sanctions and economic aid in the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voyticus said, "Is it possible to negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Following Trump's request for military assistance, instead of one, to ask Zerensky for two investigations, the first is to ask Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is to investigate the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic e-mail in the 2016 election.
It is uncertain whether this would interfere with European relations or lay backwater against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
Thanks to the announcement of the call, I would like to thank the people who helped me."
Zerensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana and the International Civil Aviation Organization won two awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana with a provisional implementation rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa by air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the UN Air Force's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was approved by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding safety at airports and in their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of the support of ICAO's delayed country zero campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications and 17 certifications were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Minister of Aviation Joseph Cofi Ada Ghana, Director General Simon Aloti Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aico Otou to Canada, and Director of Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
The President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Bennard Aliu, in his speech, stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in the participating countries.
"It is important to remain aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also said that the award is a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's efforts and patience.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a great potential to develop the domestic economy as "airs are likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump and Peter Gino were appointed as FEMA Chiefs: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Secretary of State for Emergency Management Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Council at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Secretary of FEMA, was in the position of deputy director of government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been absent from the Senate since March, when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, decided that Long had illegally used government-owned cars to commute between Washington and his home, Noor Caroline.
Jeffery Baird, who had been nominated for one, raised suspicions that he was drunk in alcohol and involved in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of the month after the examination.
Mr. Gino's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will be approved.
Before taking office as Deputy Secretary of FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Bureau in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.

"This process is very dangerous," said Captain Kano.
Captain Cano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigations and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used in the Bayp product.
"Only static electricity from clothes can fire, and since it is concentrated, it will cause not only fires but also explosions," said Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions one after another, but by fire.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigators said they received an anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still trying to figure out who the illegal Beip campaign is.
The police said that the office was empty, so Zhang himself believed that the office had a store.
As the investigation continued, the police said they would like to receive recent news, especially about the dangers of bating, tend to be illegal bating products and not go out again.
Captain Cano said, "It's really a real thing or something you're buying without knowing."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our community and children, so the police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a 6-strong earthquake!
Evacuation training at Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
A practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held every year.
At the stage, there is actually a performance by the Miyazaki Fire Department, and it is assumed that there will be a 6-strong earthquake in the middle of the song.
Approximately 300 people attended the training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff.

Participants increased their awareness of disaster prevention through training.
Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was made of the finest camlet silk and silver foil yarns were woven, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Herstic Royal Palace dress collection curator, Ellie Lin, decided to be one.
Lin saw this fading piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in the countryside, which was placed there 100 years ago, and is thought to be part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this luxurious cloth used as the altarpiece of the church in Bactton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly that room where the Tudor queen could have worn more than 450 years ago.
Only one other dress left in the 16th century was found in the entire Royal Dress Collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passage through the sleeves, three years of research have led to the growing conviction of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The high-priced textile "Silver silk cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but also embroidered plants and flowers of the "Name" quality suggest that the later addition of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen, bears were noble figures.
The dress seems to have been the price equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions when it was built.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rivals wearing such luxurious clothing could not bear.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues.
Everyone was always happy to hear the cloth saying "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one of the dresses that were cut and used as an altar cloth of the Holy Face Church in Baxton seems unexpected but not so.
Baxton is a village of Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and the local legend says that the cloth has long been associated with Parry.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Parry died, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
Over 1000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and a very delicate hand sewn altar cloth, will be displayed next to Elizabeth's portrait depicting a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings lent by Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The vast space as much as possible to store a portion of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and the work was directed by Ricky Thompson, who said, "I feel really respect for the craftsmanship of the people who made it."
When you look at the embroidered embroidery on the front and back, you will find a great respect to the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
A week after the missing girl's request, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew and the volunteer men were missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It's a week since the first-year elementary school girl was missing at a campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces, without any clues, closed the search and withdrew on 28th.
The search for Kokura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared, and the search for the 28th day began at 6 am.
However, the village requested to withdraw from the Self-Defense Forces as "the scope of the request has been searched."
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly on the slopes of mountains and dangerous places such as Sawa, but they couldn't find clues.
On the 27th, there was no way to know the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who participated in the search by volunteers.
The police and fire department plans to continue searching from 6:30 am on the 29th.
First oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, where voters were seeking to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the Plaintiff appealed for election invalidity, as compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member is the lowest in the country in July this year, the value of one vote is 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture.
In the first oral speech held at the Fukuoka High Court Miyazaki Branch on the 27th, the plaintiff claimed that "the value of one vote was inequality and unconstitutional."
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendants called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It should not be said that the issue of constitutionality was in a significant inequality, but should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

Survivors arrive at the space station Catch with Robot Arm | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
"Konotori" No. 8 drones arrived at the International Space Station.
The robot arm of the station is growing from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th (JAXA provided)
On the night of 28th, the unmanned spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA), carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), which is about 400 kilometers high, arrived near the station, and the astronauts during their stay operated the robotic arm.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced with the control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the speed difference and approaches to a distance of about 10 meters.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters long is a flow that grabs the supply machine.
The aircraft had about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching to the station, the flight crew carry luggage.
one third of the u.s. domestic drugs
Chicago After the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Control Authority (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
Last year, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose in Chicago.
McNight said the drug "probably 90%" was brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king, commonly known as El Mencio Servantes.
Mexican agent Matthew DonahewDEA said, "Mencho is DEA and, in fact, the top-prior of the federal law enforcement agency."
The prize money raised by El Mencho reached $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug production sites in the dense forests of El Mencho were devastated.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva, is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "mass" cocaine, methane fetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and returned to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels.
It owns a large amount of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
Donahew said that he actually owns his own special maneuvers.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic, so it is necessary to wear protective clothing when handling.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the solder.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively take the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said that it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news, PS4 games have been released in the past.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent state of play announcement, Sony announced the release date of the sequel to Last of As in February 2020.
Some of the video footage of this new action game was also presented to fans.
A few days after the last of the two major announcements, further details were announced.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in various ways.
Since the PSwan era, the last of the as part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous work, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to tell the story that there were many characters like this.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game was very spectacular and did not enter a single Blu-ray, making it two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 includes one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it is not possible to ruin this surprise, Easter eggs in the game include nostalgic notydog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently released the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including popular character Erie backpacks and bracelet replicas, and bonus versions with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Save" Council Trials Residents wish to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, mobile sales started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council, a local resident.
In an attempt until December, wagons with daily necessities, seasonings, and food ran through Susomachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
There were also products that were quickly supplemented by selling more than expected, and residents said they wanted to continue saying "help" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, designated garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiro gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Susomachi-kai, there were rows of residents, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akikazu Kikuchi of the Council expressed his surprise that "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with his husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I don't know when my father can drive, and I hope he will continue."
Users also received orders such as "I want you to bring coffee that you don't have canned coffee, but you don't want to do it yourself."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to save "shop weak."
By December, the 20 town councils on the island will be around once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed the decision to provide additional $100 million to drought-stricken residents.
Cash support policies for farmers suffering from droughts have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been significantly revised to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-affected resident support organization and the target farmers will receive an emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive assistance from drought relief funds with a maximum of $100 million for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion in funding for drought relief.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014, killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of his five children.
According to the authorities, on July 9, 2014, Haskell was forced into his residence and asked for the whereabouts of his wife Melanie Haskell.
Melanie was absent, but she had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old son, nine and seven years old daughter died.
Only one person in his family and the fifteen-year-old Cassidy Stay survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that he was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed the innocence of Ronald Lee Haskell's loss of heart.
The jury was dismissed from the charges until Monday.
"If you choose to disappoint us, never forgive us."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook her anger was echoed by the leaders of other countries.
Global warming is becoming more serious.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
The young people who raised anxiety and irritation protested all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people attended in more than 150 countries.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will start in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century, and to reduce global warming by less than twice before the Industrial Revolution.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed countries and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather conditions, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, have been pointed out to be associated with global warming.
In order to increase global warming at a faster pace, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit achieved by the call of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal of virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which had announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not explicitly express their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers emerged.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
The Minister of the Environment, Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's efforts at the environmental-related meeting, said in a press conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal does not deny, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no resistance to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wounds that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "replacement of issues" that the person opposes.
There is no longer a grace to cope with global warming, and the international community must respond to the common crisis of humanity.
There is no sufficient effectiveness in the efforts of each country.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is adults who should act to avoid taking the future.
and one step to realize quantum internet
The U.S. Army's research results led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and time-keeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Distributed Quantum Information Center of the Army Research Institute of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded by the Army Research Institute, researchers at the University of Innsbruck achieved a record of quantum entangling between matter and light - 50 km away using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state and the measurement is performed on one side, even if the other quantum bits are physically far away, the measurement results are affected by the other.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Dr. Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network of physical quantum bits in the entangled state despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a great step to realize large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, Deputy Secretary of the Army Program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum network use.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions and excited them to release photons stored in quantum information at the same time.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
The team then sent the light particles through non-linear crystals with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, the optimal value of long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangled network of long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army from the perspective of accurate positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications."
