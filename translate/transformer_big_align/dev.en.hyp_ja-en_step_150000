Croatia is planning nuclear treatment facilities, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the town of northwestern Bosnia and protested the plan of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstration participants gathered in the town of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the Turgovska Gola barracks and fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," and "We need a hard stop" said that nuclear waste disposal facilities could threaten the lives of about 250,000 residents in the Una and surrounding areas.
We must oppose it.
The mayor of Novi Grado, Miloslav Driaka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko nuclear power plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided to build its own storage facility or to pay the cost of the waste of Croatia that Slovenia would be treated at newly built facilities.
Croatian Minister of the Environment and Energy, Tomislav Chorich, told the announcer that Croatia had problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wanted to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would Bosnian pants pocket, that is, Trugovska Gola, be the best place in Croatia?"

The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are sick.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.

There are various types of pathology, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is suspected to be a disease of himself.
However, the representative Münchhausen syndrome is clearly false that others under their protection are ill.
It is also known as FII, a type of child abuse.
Although it is unusual, parents usually exaggerate symptoms or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what is the sign of the proxy Munchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following as a precaution.
The children are healthy, but if they are poor, they try to calm down.
I'll explain to you, or complain about false symptoms.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing that they are diabetes.
Overdose drugs and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How general is Münchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.
what should we do if we suspect a child's damage?

Nigeria: police force investigation into caduna schools and rescue 300 children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police conducted a forced investigation yesterday at Imam Ahmed Bun Hanbal School in Rain Maidhuven Tumma, Igabi, arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
Police said that the children were placed in an inhumane environment, but the school denied this claim.
The school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
The parents came to deliver a meal to their children every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were.
I was very surprised that the police came and evacuated the kids, and all the food they had delivered to their parents left behind.
There are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair treatment."
He added that Abdullahman, former police headquarters, had visited once to confirm what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Corlan and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Savo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of getting knowledge of Corlan, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were beaten back.
So we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

An order to confront the victim in court, a girl raped by the Central Coast's "super villainous" camouflage dress.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending school in Central Coast, Virginia.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to trees and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges, including this assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
A 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on a small road and witnessed a man armed with a large tree branches and knives suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, don't stop."
The man said to the girl, "Don't speak loud.
When I hear it, I can't get it."
The man had a knife on his right hand and the girl's hands tied in a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused it for nearly an hour.
When a man broke the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., without responding to several phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood in his clothes with mud, grass, and trees, and claimed that he had been involved in street violence and chased the driver down to the bush, and that he had been around by hand.
The man's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development warns IT representatives of public interest
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, investors, etc. that if there was no ethical assessment of public interest on Friday, artificial intelligence development competition and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met.
At the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
This three-day meeting was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in the discussion of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of war technology development and increased machine work, and at the same time, case studies were conducted in Christchurch, New Zealand on gunfire incidents and the response of social media companies during the atrocities.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely on robotic engineering to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If the advancement of technology causes increasingly noticeable inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological progress is hostile to public interests, unfortunately, it will be counterproductive to a state of barbarism based on the theory of strong people.
According to the organizers of the conference, they would like to take advantage of the expertise of the participants and find the talent to be a future advisor to the Catholic Church on the high-tech field.

Fan excitement with Real Madrid loaned players Martin Woodegor and uplifted assist.
Martín Udegor showed a surprise support for Michel O'Ayrsabar.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, renewing the domestic season's undefeated record and moving to the top of La Liga.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, the director Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency of Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, the pressure seemed to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniole is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martín Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Arabes, was surprised by Michel O'Ayalusabal's pre-emptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite pass through the inside of the other two players to Oyaru Sabal to decide the goal by receiving this completely accurate through ball.
The second goal of Willian Jose and the third goal of the stunning Oyalusabar penalty spot ensured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before Alabeth's midfiller, Manu Garcia, withdrew in 5 minutes.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated this territory.
Anna Hazale, and Sharad Powerle's name was surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When we contacted this lawsuit, the name of Sharad Powerle was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Office (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Amit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Amit Powerll and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When he came to contact the lawsuit, his name was nowhere.
Anna Hazale was questioned about the alleged action by the executive and the alleged involvement of Sharad Powerr in the fraud, and stated on Thursday that "only they know how the name of Sharad emerged or who referred it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that if the executive conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerle denied any misconduct and claimed that it had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the Maharashtra parliamentary election on October 21.
The former coalition minister clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
The NCP referred to the action by the Executive Bureau as a political abbreviation.

On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had classified epipen as "Generic" in the Medicaid drug rebate program.

Stepping the accelerator pedal eliminates accidents!
Four Preliminary Prevention Devices - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driver error.
In particular, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator steps by elderly drivers is on an increasing trend.
In particular, when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes a panic, and sometimes the accelerator continues to follow the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with a safety driver support function to cover such a driver error, but there is also a rearing device that can be attached to an unattended car.
Such an after-sale parts manufacturer is developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped simultaneously.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] The "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot informs you of pedal mistake from a new perspective.
The pedal's step-by-step error is avoided by an alarm.
The mechanism causes an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake when you stop or run slow.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and by recognizing the mistake quickly, it avoids rapid acceleration.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf to hear.
The mounting is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excl. tax) and it is easy to set.
The world wing was launched in mid-September to prevent accelerator and brake stepping errors.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is stepped rapidly, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the sudden start.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I didn't tell the signal from the accelerator and instantly controlled the advance by turning it into a creeping state (where I left the brake in the D range).
It is equipped with a function to detect the speed of about 5Km/h at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The mounting is only possible with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

About 20 mothers, who are raising children, consider the form of disaster prevention suitable for each family, and summarize their awareness and requests for local governments.
Ms. Suosato KUSUNOMOTO (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that a three-year-old child who liked nursery school suddenly disappeared after the flood and was forced to go to the nursery school at night.
"It was because adults were busy cleaning up the house and didn't have enough time to face," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can't panic and say "OK" to children."
Yukari Okushi (36) in Shiraishi Town spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
"If you have a child who can't stay still, you will feel around you."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was watered around her house.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the event of a disaster.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in family structure and housing situation."
Shinko Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has six and eight-year-old children, proposed that elementary school had an e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or email system.
There was also a request to build a system that could share the flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "It was okay last time."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
TANAKA said, "The opinion that was issued is also thought to convey to the administration as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and Jennifer Curi, a female businessman, and a police agency
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandal in London's mayor's office as a violation of the Penal Code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts concerning acts" on suspicion that Mr. Curi had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"The matter of conduct exists in the presence of information that indicates that crime may have been done," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The issue was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC was an agency that responded to accusations issued by police in England and Wales.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the police chief at the time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information about his relationship with Arcuri, although he claimed it was "consultuous."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported that U.S. citizens who moved to London seven years ago were paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the Mayor's era, and that Johnson and others were encouraged to participate in three foreign trade-related dispatches.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to the hacker house, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked questions about the investigation process before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Curi (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among employees."
The movement of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory authority touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say that this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the Conservative Party's previous night was "too pro-party."
"In any case, the supervisory authority did not submit any evidence, and the prime minister was not given an opportunity to answer the supervisory authority prior to the press release issued late Friday night."
Both the people and the mass media will be able to see the political Kyogen that was created by the people.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division was "public secret."
The former staff of the London & Partners (L&P) said that despite some who considered the company "untrustful" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany Mr. Curi to a foreign trade-related meeting led by Mr. Johnson during the mayoral period.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Sawakami Sunobu.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
What are you feeling now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the people involved, not just the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of supporting the formation of property for general consumers.
This spirit remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from the anxiety of money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operation will not be performed unless you walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" has many money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have stated since our day, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
We believe that this is the reason why we became a long-term fund for 20 years, and that we continued to be a direct sales system that delivered messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you're buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc. miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested for drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling fake tablets of oxycodon containing phenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had mistakenly held before he died of overdose cocaine, alcohol, and Fentanil, but Fentanil is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Pett, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Pettyt was getting drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Pettyt as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, nor are there any objections about individual cases.
Walter, who is currently in custody, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The prosecutors in charge of the case, first reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, requested that Walter be detained until the start of the trial due to the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to the phone call to the lawyer.
Petitt was prosecuted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defenders refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics have been accompanied by frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram, and released a song titled "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died of opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died of drug overdose in 2016 and found Fentanil and Hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, he revised Walter's name to Stephen instead of Steven.
Development of more than 30 mobile games, 9yearolds in Nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch2 to create a hidden game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats coming out of hiding places.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that he spends time building games when he's bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day short-term intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course hosted by Codefest International was introduced to give children such as Basil a chance to experience new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in numerous mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but how do you make games yourself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basil, who had been interested in learning how to make his own games, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, has his own name in the game.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and the younger generation, such as Basil-chan, will take the initiative if African innovation is made.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds have been awarded a robot that uses program code to divide housework.
In May 2019, the women's high school team of Ghana, Akrobot, who programming boxed robots, won the Robofest Contest.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil and children of the same age are going to become future programming stars.
the former chairman of the North Carolina Republicans, a criminal conviction for bribery.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely accused federal investigators who conducted corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted on Wednesday next week.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based document does not specify which sin Hayes admits.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
The prosecution accused former Hayes of involvement in the insurance company's plan to fund the state's insurance director's election in return for special treatment.
Two co-owners, Greg Lindbergh, were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cozy.
Lindberg is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $500 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported Republican philosophy and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer asked him to comment on Friday and email, but he did not reply.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the defendant's lawyer, called for an additional comment by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, stating that Hayes never had a conversation with Corsey about the staff of the state insurance bureau.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindberg's request for a meeting with Corsey, and also discussed bribes directly with the director.
The prosecution, published in April, claimed that Lindberg had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to raise $2 million to campaign for Cozy's 2020 re-election.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindberg's company.
Republican Corsey reported alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no doubts.
In an indictment, it is described in a conversation involving Lindberg and Cosey that Lindberg co-owners instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cozy's re-election campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would draw attention if he had moved so expensive money, but he eventually broke up in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
i know, i'll do it.
The Federal Prosecutors' Office of Public Prosecutors asked an e-mail for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like someone else's posts!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and only posters can be seen.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Mea Garrick, Head of Policy in Facebook Australia, said that this change was based on feedback from mental health professionals who would consider the number of happy surveys and goodies to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had a very positive feedback from a number of bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
It is only to delete numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange rather than the number of good or reaction.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
It is very early to say that the test is conducted in countries such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when this test will end or whether it will be changed.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very active Facebook and Instagram user.
He thought Australia would be a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If my favorite bag is broken, I want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was Cando's handcrafted parts that helped me at that time.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, the first one is the ultimate Petit Pra.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main body was significantly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up.
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for the replacement of this connected fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver color.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was moved when I discovered it in the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It was originally used for key holders and Charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one on both ends of the bag handle, and we bought two items.
The size of the ring is small, but if you put it on one side of the bag, make it exactly the same ...
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is a smooth installation.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, it is difficult to move ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The number of fittings has increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight is not a problem at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts has increased and the level has been improved in design.
The express "Aso" of the National Railways is a temporary train Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train that was inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded 12 blue cars from Hiroshima Station and left Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, a tour was organized.
The trains run seven-car trains, including the Sanyo Line, Chikuto Line and Kagoshima Line.
A special headmark was drawn by Mt. Aso.
his brother's life imprisonment with the honor murder of a Pakistani social media star, kandir burochi.
Candy Baroch, who gained fame in his photos posted on social media, was hanged in July 2016.
His older brother, the popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of his sister's murder on Friday, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the most attention of his father-in-law, Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by Balochi, who is famous for being provocative in Pakistan, which is very strong for women's contempt.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
His older brother said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister "Of course" and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Saldahl Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan in the eastern city was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshira (God's thought) will be innocent in the Supreme Court," he said.
Prior to this, Balochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that he wanted his son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Baroch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of his misrepresentation of the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "principal murders."
In the case of Mr. Barochi, a woman chooses a marriage partner by herself, she burns, kills, stabs or strangles her family with crimes such as admiration for her sexuality.
The murder is usually carried out by relatives.
Later, in Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) laws, the perpetrators can be pardoned from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill that required life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the killer may also claim another motive in theory and be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted that his son not be pardoned.
However, the parents who were sad about losing their son changed their thoughts and told them they would forgive their son.
Due to international hate for killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
His famous actions include the offer of a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team, and the wearing of a bright red dress on Valentine's Day.
It became critical and threatening, but it was recognized by many people, including young people, when the new heavens were opened in a country where expressing themselves as a presence like Kim Kardashian was considered a bold and political activity to improve women's status.
The roots of the "principal" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, especially in women's behavior, although men may be victims.

(From left) ASA Amami Sports Academy
【Okinagarabe General Bureau】ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda, Amami City) and Okinaga Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda, China Town) signed a partnership for the promotion of remote island sports on April 25.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects conducted by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
When both organizations conduct training related to sports, they mediate, dispatch, and share information.
When a team of remote islands travel outside of the island to participate in a tournament, they will work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in the event of a prefectural tournament and other events on the mainland, we will support the reduction of the performance of the athletes due to fatigue on board trips and staying overnight.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players who came from outside the island by cooperating with local recoil clinics and hospital officials.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Elabco in China-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.
After that, the two organizations co-hosted a training session by Athletic Trainer Yuichiro Hidaka.
Local sports boys, club leaders, and parents learned the proper use of taping and prevention efforts.
Mr. Sonoda (52) said, "The purpose of the activities of avoiding the handicap of remote islands in terms of sports environment is common to each other, and there are many areas that can cooperate.
Mr. Maeda (43) said, "It is very hard to have a partnership with a proven organization like ASA, and I would like to absorb good things to improve the sports environment for children on remote islands."
Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking about "mote" twice.
The brain science theory is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), the non-mote otoko stick to the traditional "man's fantasy" and the pattern learning to make it is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool man.
if you're bound by what you should do, you're going to live.
In the first part, we talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and the behavior of people.
When learning patterns, I think that in this case, the brain systemizes the behavior so that I can live in Lak.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether it's "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
Since I was teaching at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit tough if you're sticking to the old pattern of "a university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say what you should do or what you should do, you will live.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I've been talking about that in my recent talk book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that naturally emerge around him.
It's not that easy.
It is painful if you ask yourself around.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a proven track record have no need to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," you cannot be light.
As long as I hear a lot of women, regardless of their position or age, it seems to be a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to find out what this "cute" is.

Nigeria's illegal state doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 in the last four months due to increased violence.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, each institution will work together to raise funds for $35.5 million.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that the Islamic extremist organization Boko Haram, which has been active in the northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in the last 10 months in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"The fear of illegal and unstable conditions is well represented," Barrok said on Friday to the press.
Abducts, tortures, assaults, murders and sexual violence have occurred frequently, and the raiders have destroyed residences and are working on thefts.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Boko Haram and the West African Branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," he says.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that, in particular, the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees crossing Niger would increase in the coming months.
the men who killed two women and two children were confirmed.
The guatemara men's trial date was confirmed to have killed two women and their children in Iowa.
According to the Poke County Court records, Marvin Escobar Ollyana (31) was prosecuted for the first-class murder in three cases, the false name of Marvin Eskibel Lopez, who was initially referred to by the authorities.
He claims not guilty.
According to the police, on 16 July, at Demoin's house, he shot Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and her son (5).
In court records, a new date of trial will be decided on 27 January, giving the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare.
According to officials of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Bureau, Escobal Ollyana was illegally staying in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.

LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising framework according to their needs.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a mechanism that allows media companies to prioritize high-priced ads by conducting fair bidding competition with multiple bidders.
It is said that the introduction of large media is progressing mainly as a solution for media companies that are transparent and can expect improvement in profitability.
In the past, SSP has been providing advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase advertising frameworks that meet the needs of advertisers.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP's header binding allows them to participate in bidding directly to the header binding target advertising frame, which is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, due to the limited number of media companies in the target market, the advertising framework of each commercial or brand image is secured to prevent damage to brand value.
One of the advantages of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each bidder company called "Lapper Solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, enables efforts to meet the needs of media companies.

Two months of suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata at Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that a male assistant professor at the Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.

The university also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students led by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts Call Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and make compromises with the EU The Sun
Now that only three weeks have passed since the EU summit, there is a growing concern around the Prime Minister that the prime minister might be over time to withdraw significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding the withdrawal of the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations over a new tariff system that replaces the Irish border-related backstop clauses are tight, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative to "impossible."
The senior ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose a compromise proposal on the ground, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the Conservatives' annual convention in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the "extreme" strategy that threatens the EU devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings without agreement, and insist that the EU will accept the offer that will be issued in limited time.
One cabinet member said that the ruling that the Supreme Court had illegally closed the assembly on Tuesday would be "a bell," and that "the compromise is the only way we can leave on October 31."
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his steps.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and the Camings project is clearly failing.
It is impossible to fight in so many fields.
Another minister promised to speak to Johnson to carry out the pre-Prime Minister's draft.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many things that everyone wants to end.
If we do not postpone, Boris will end and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party said in a harsh speech: "The Prime Minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting with cows, inspecting eggs in the Uerres, and discussing with the people in the streets.
The Prime Minister's press yesterday admitted that the agreement was still a long way ahead, saying, "If anyone can't make a difference, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month rescheduled withdrawal, would greatly weaken our position of negotiations in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are trying to make progress hard despite the legislation has been enacted."
The European Union Delegation Minister Steven Berkeley returns to Brussels today to discuss further with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two discuss how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly said in his Glasgow accent that he was told by the TV station boss that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was very nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and to see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewed by legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a TV-am Scotland reporter in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorraine.
In celebration of her 35th anniversary, she broadcast a special program to reflect Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
" passion, enthusiasm, and curiosity" were the key to survival in the television industry, and the host said, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
Do what you should do, get interested in and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that she was "very painful" about the Dunbrane shooting.
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't even think that many of the families of children who were killed or injured were watching us broadcast the show live from Dunbrane.
Pam Ross, who was killed by her mother and five-year-old daughter Joanna, personally wants to see me, so we talked for hours at her house.
I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, saying that it was "very painful" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
i was afraid of a trap.
According to a senior government official, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga refused the offer of President Robert Mugabe, who was in the midst of a political change, due to anxiety that he might be a trap in November 2017.
During the coup d'état, the Zimbabwe Independent reported that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give him the presidency.
However, Chiwenga refused the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders of all over the world and the African Union that he was deprived of the regime in a coup, rather than anxiety, and government officials reported on social media.
According to a series of Twitter by Jamwanda2, officials confirmed that he was a senior official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has held the administration for 37 years, is willing to give the administration to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munngawa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
Mugabe, who realized he was losing power, told the government officials that he had made contact with the envoy to Chiwenga.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was carried out by three.
It was reported that President Spokesman George Charanba, the top representative of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, Aaron Nepera and the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Muconoli, were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Zimbabwe Preparatory Bank, was entrusted by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to condemn the African Union's actions while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to give the presidency to the former CDF was not due to the selection of the former president.
"It was a wasteful act to save a dangerous and rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, at least the political aim of the late president was to change the flow even in diplomacy.
If you destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to conflict with the African Union's view of the coup, but remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and would crush the claims of the commanders who claimed that he had not broken the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, who had not yet fully grasped the situation, would decide whether to position it as a coup, would eventually be considered a coup, and that military intervention requests would be valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe would have to write his resignation.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that they would not turn guns to the citizens even if they had invaded the president's house called Blueloo.
At that point, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove his power deprivation by the military.
The commanders and commanders at the time read the intent accurately.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa (which we belong to the camouflage group) " were used in the words of an envoy to convey the desperate message of the president, officials of the government said, "We are not politicians nor political competition."
The government officials said that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the aim was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munangaguwa, who had been in exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at that time, South Africans who were key to this process refused to intervene, but were repeatedly threatened behind it, clarifying that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military had invaded the presidency.
"It wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, so it didn't come to fruition," he said.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to the ban on nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th at the UN Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and Michiko Takeuchi, the granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, delivered a speech and appealed to the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
Five new countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and ratified it in 32 countries and regions.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were made in accordance with the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern in recent years that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is nothing else to eliminate."
China needs strong leadership.
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In the White Paper, the Chinese State Council said that the success of the Communist Party's administration 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
If there is no unified strong leadership, China will lead to division and collapse, and it will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified dealing with issues in a rigid manner, such as the repression of democratic movements in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he held the government in late 2012.
Mr. Xi has also directed a military modernization program that threatens the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development models, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but rather merely seek peace.
Among the genes of the Chinese people, there is no aggression or world control.
In modern times, China was bullied by a strong column, and war and confusion left a deep scar with that pain; China would never give the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as sluggish economic conditions and anti-government movements in Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never abandon its core interests and will not allow the loss of security and sovereignty.
"The tariffs that continue to rise with the threat of the trade war are no problem-solving," says White Paper in connection with the trade dispute with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market spaces and strong economic development momentum.
"It will never be weakened by the trade war."
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities, and opening a new world.
He added that the United States should take the development of China calmly, as China does not have any idea of countering the United States and does not want to replace it with the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more likely to stop China's development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, oppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Takayoshi dismissed Hirata's director and Kaneko's manager. (Sports News) - Yahoo! News
Yokohama Taka, a famous high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masashi Kaneko (42).
In the future, Daiki Takayama will be acting as the coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will be determined promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that local newspapers had a rumor about baseball club members.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's neck, and Kimko admitted a part of the rumor.
In addition, in light of the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they were dismissed on 28 January because they generally accepted the facts.
In the summer of Yokohama, Motochika WATANABE (74) who raised pitchers such as Daisuke MATSUSAKA (present-day Nakanichi) bravely withdrew.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
In the summer of the 16th century, he participated in the Koshien Garden in the summer for three consecutive years.
However, after losing to Sagamihara, the prefectural capital in the semifinals this summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in autumn and was desperate for the next spring.
The Spice Girls' MelC, a diet disorder disease, banned diet topics in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, who had not eaten anything except fruit and vegetables for many years, admitted that diet was banned at home.
Sporty spices have long been "excessive exercise" under pressure from members of the global pop group, and have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom told her that her experience was influenced by her daughter Scarlett's child-rearing, stating that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old, and I'm getting more attention to my own appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
Having gained fame as a member of Spice Girls in the 1990s, in front of SNS Taito, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that a "bad" comment on himself written in the media led to a physical problem.
"I didn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, I became obsessed with exercise more and more, and I was too thin."
I didn't feel well, and it lasted almost a few years."
Judiciary judgment of same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch judged that this was a case where 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' was a dispute between the same sexes.
More than 20 countries recognize same-sex marriages, and there is a system in which local governments such as Sapporo City certify the same-sex partnership.
The decision was based on the fact that two women married.
It is considered the first judicial decision to admit legal protection to the same-sex couples and is meaningful.
There are five lawsuits in Sapporo and other prefectures that claim damages to the country as unconstitutional because of the provisions of civil law and family register law.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights of sexual minorities and discuss how the legal system should recognize various families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years, and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The decision was certified as "the reality of the fact that marriage between men and women is not the same."
It is an epoch-making decision that expands the recognition of actual marriage with the right to conform to marriage in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that defines marriage as "only based on mutual agreement."
It is said that both sexes were "unprecedented at the time of the establishment because same-sex marriage was not assumed, and the purpose of denying same-sex marriage is not understood."
"The Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," but it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the absence of same-sex marriages, the problem remained that "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women."
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect while recognizing the same reality as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, about 70% of people considered same-sex marriage to be legally recognized have changed their consciousness.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if the law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a spouse who admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax systems and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from various viewpoints, such as not only marriage between same-sex couples, but also expansion of legal rights for married couples.
to the trial and jury of former athletes prosecuted for rape of multiple women
A jury trial was held for former Delaware University baseball players who were accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
The 21-year-old woman stated that she had been sexually assaulted after sending her to her home by car.
After three weeks of meeting at Bumble, Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault the woman.
The defense argued that women's contradictory claims and memory differences would have regretted having physical relationships.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure, "It is the next season that I took Penangt." - Yahoo! News
In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final match of this season, and the possibility of his own entry into CS was lost.
If the player wins the remaining three games, they will be eliminated.
At the ceremony after the match, Takashi Ogata (50) apologized, "I'm sorry that I couldn't win the final match, and I couldn't confirm my position.
He was a fan of some.
At the end of his speech, he said, "I will do my best to rob Penant in the next season."
However, after the ceremony, when the press asked him about the matter, he said, "I'm not finished yet, so everything."
【Dospo】Ota is the first person to be transferred to Japan after his transfer to Japan, and he is the number 20.
He became a "returner" to seniors.
Four times, he was greeted by one lead, and on the left side, he made his 20th home run with a liner.
I reached the number of home runs that I was aiming at, "I stopped this number and tried to do it again, and I became a big one."
The director's intention was also firm.
This was the first time a four-point transfer was made.
He said, "I put it in the fourth place so I could swing.
Oda responded by saying, "I felt that I was so proud that I entered the game, and I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal four statues is Abe, a giant who retired from active service this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads to victory, and the 4th of the team is the result every day.
Among them, "The appearance of Mr. Abe is the most thought: he was a reliable person, and he looked at his back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist attractions, the video clearly
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest contributor to the opera house, the Cerculer Key, the Luna Park, and the famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 cups of pollutants flow every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title, "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around the most popular cities in Australia have a lot of suckers, plastic bags, plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing through rainwater into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting waterways.
Dr. Katherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most polluted estuaries in Japan.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastics per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow through rainwater drains into Sydney Harbour.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but after that, Sydney Harbour was pretty tragic," Dr. Duffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what the truth is there," said David Center Manley, owner Richard Nichols, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is underneath the water surface), I think everyone will be really excited.
Over half of what we discover is plastic bags.
Plastics are used at least somewhere in the remaining half.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone can see that all these plastics and garbage are flowing down the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of Ocean Protect's founders and director, said that it could be done by local residents and tourists to reduce the amount of plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the use of plastics, recycles more well, and eventually flows into the sea, so you need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
However, we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study of plastics and mental health was also presented this month, along with the release of this video, funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of an effort to promote awareness of the environmental protection of Australian people and the reduction of the effects of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between 12 and 18 have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
In this study, the parents also ranked fourth in concerns about plastic waste, and 93 percent of the 551 parents surveyed said they were increasingly worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Station was demolished in October | The Government and Society of Saga News | Saga Shimbun
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which started dismantlement work in October, is Futako, Karatsu City
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) located in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
Disassembly was used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
One chimney is broken down by a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine buildings and boilers were not destroyed.
The man in his 60s, who runs a restaurant nearby, said, "When I look back from the far away and see the chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and second in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station are nearby, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine electric cars, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell goods.
I am now (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, a free announcer, Shinma Takahashi, a commentator on CBC TV, said about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save me.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a master beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
It is different from what I am doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry and what is important as a working person.
I finally became an announcer of the TV station by 120% of my efforts, but when I was struck by something called "cone" or "busyk," my father said, "I thought it was "cone, but it wasn't."
Then, around the second and third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty woman can do it."Even when I was not motivated because I didn't want to do my job, and my heart was rotten, "Who would do my best if I wanted to do it."If so, I asked everyone to do it, but I was glad that I was in charge of Mama.
i learned naturally from my father's acting.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but since I joined the TV station, I've been in touch with the news for a long time with the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news, and Mr. Matsuko deluxe was happy and confident that he was "very good at reading Mama news."
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sensed.
It has been cultivated by watching father's stage, movies, TVs and period dramas in childhood.
In other words, I think it is thanks to my father because I have a lot of experiences in my childhood.

The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020.
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which the International Automobile Federation (FIA) is governed by, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, it has been held every year to become the world's highest rallying championship with history and tradition, and it is said that the competition is the most severe car competition because it is not only closed public roads (paved roads), but also gravel roads and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Shoo Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation) and Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation), both governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, said the following.
Mr. Hideaki Omura, Governor of Aichi Prefecture
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will cooperate with relevant parties to work hard to achieve the success of the 2020 Fall Games in order to be the center of Japan's motorsports industry to appeal to the world greatly."
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all here."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation)
"I am very pleased to be running Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motorsports, commented on the Japanese round.
The Japan round of the WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Shirakucho) and Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ebisu City).
The main venue is the "Love - Global Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is it the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmanian devils may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers are opening a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient care.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells were camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurred in Tasmanian devils and humans.
This finding is expected to create a new way to treat cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCall Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to tackling fatal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags used a series of proteins called PRC2 to camflage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and skin cancer called mellkel cells.
Prof. Mark Dawson, Peter McClum's researcher, said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Reuse traditional therapies, revitalizing markers, i.e. proteins known as MHC, may enable the immune system to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a considerable impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is an epidemic in the world.
They may be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils, where cancer cells escape detection.
"Unfortunately, the exact same process occurs in human and Tasmanian devil cancers," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may be useful for controlling tumors."
scientists are puzzled by a giant planet orbiting a tiny star
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system covering the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-shaped planets orbit around small stars called red dwarfs, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting the red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, led this research published in scientific journals.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is quite low as about 3800 Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I'm doing red color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales stated that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining the elliptic orbit of the Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gases and dust that create their own orbiting stars.
The most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, generates objects from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes the atmosphere by pulling the egg out of the planet.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature might have been lower."
Since the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses may grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a medip containing a stimulant, and acquitted to his colleagues.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating dipping beans with a wake-up agent to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of the transfer of methane fetamine, a Class B felony, and suspected of taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavits obtained from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because Medina Hernández saw him making beans.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach became worse and her legs were fluffy.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have had methane phetamine in the bead dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández "was told the victim's food that he had put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he had accidentally put methane fetamine into the beans dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows that Medina Hernández turned her back to the camera and clinched behind the microwave but pulled something out of the brager.
It is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put the beans dip in a small paper plate.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was jailed in Marion County instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest records of Medina Hernández include assault, robbery, sneeze, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Asks can be organized" President of JR Tokai and Focus on Early Construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on the 27th, President Shin Kaneko of JR Tokai reiterated his stance on early construction, stating that the issue of the reduction in the flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen Nan Alps Tunnel, "It is better to separate the issues that are being discussed with Shizuoka Prefecture before starting construction and what should be done after starting construction."
More specifically, he said, "Let's talk at the meeting place and at the front stage."
Mr. Kaneko said, "When we organize all the problems, it's hard to start the project, and I think it's possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our thoughts, we have to talk to the prefecture."
The prefectural side is concerned that the spring water that went into the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding the change in the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that "I would do it if I could be realistic, but I thought it would be difficult to think of it from the safety side of the construction."
He denied that the route change mentioned by Governor Kawakatsu Hirata was "not possible."
The impact on the opening period was that the president pointed out three locations: the South Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station, which took a particularly long time for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun
Five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced the hospital's name on March 26 that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare needed to restructure and integrate.
The population of 13 medical institutions in the prefecture is 38 and 5%, which is the tenth highest in the country, and three have already been integrated and transferred.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Midoriki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Agency (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital, Fujitsu-gun.

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise and frequent use of royal aircraft
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
Usually, it is easy to use private machines that move royal families around the world for important events and appearances.

Queen Elizabeth loved dogs since she was a child, and it is said that she had more than 30 coggie dogs when she became queen.
In 2007, he had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linet, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, five Cocker Spaniel vists, oxo, flash, pick, and spans were added, as well as four Daxhunt and Coggy mix dogs cider, Berry Balkan and Candy.
The staff on the royal aircraft will be busy.
The royal staff had been seen asking them to leave the dog on the grass before boarding, and Seals continued.
I have never been in an accident.
The show also found that the Queen's official travel luggage was known for a shocking amount.
According to the narrator, "The Queen's luggage was 12 tons on a 44,000-mile British federal tour in 1953."
It is generally understood that it corresponds to two large elephants.
But the Queen is not the only one who likes fashion.
The wife of the Marquis of Cambridge is also said to have her own taste when carrying her clothes, and in Uwasa, she takes one seat per dress.

Trump Hotel owner's suitability complaints, liquor sales license holds
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Commission has dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the local Trump International Hotel's license to sell liquor because of its owner's questionability.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three members, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, in accordance with the state law that requires the applicant's "appropriateness" to obtain a license for liquor sales, the appeal to cancel the right to provide alcohol at the hotel is second.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year included repeated frauds against Trump's assault and violating state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time an appeal was issued to update the permit.

In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September of the same year.
More than 100 bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make beekeeping on the factory grounds that assemble cars?
I want to taste this!
Click here for the honey that Bentley handles.
Peter Bosch, executive officer in the manufacturing department of Bentley, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant this year.
The beekeepers watched the beekeepers from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains as the beekeepers were gathering various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been working on a wide range of activities to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers through its Crew Plants and our business.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the amount of betre honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to carry out various initiatives to fulfill our role." In May 2019, 12 million bees of bees, Flying Bees, started.
In September of the same year, after a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator and filtered the fallen honey.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The label was designed by Louise McCarlum, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff, but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
We want to enjoy afternoon tea, not only Fennel tea that is compatible with honey, but also honey from Flying Bees such as scones.
it's the worst of the u.K. in a scandalous Cleveland police report.
The police arrested the British for the worst.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in any field.
The Cleveland Police continues to "a serious deterioration," says Phil Gomley.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, efforts were made to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley of the Police Director said, "It has continued to be a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
The police chief Mike Wiel resigned in January, less than a year after his inauguration, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for multiple charges of unpublished.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee of the illegal act for his colleagues to act sexually.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Interior Ministry intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal" and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what will happen.
At present, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate," Pelosi told CNN in Congress.
"We're going to do a job that we're starting to do based on time to discover facts and facts," said Pelosi.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Worodimir Zerensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, who were candidates for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zerensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Juliani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN reported on Thursday that it was a national security lawyer in the Ministry of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before formal inquiries.
The Ministry of Justice, who was charged as an inquiry by information agencies, decided that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of violations of political financing.
In response to the question of whether Barr should testify, Pelosi stated Friday that the intelligence special committee would decide who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that he thought he was "criminal."
Certainly, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the telephone talks with the President of Ukraine in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will approach the decision regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" when Trump attacked the whistler on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
The president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that internal accusers play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to the whistleblowers is a significant loss of the sum within the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that Trump would formally impeach the foreign leaders for political benefits and wrote a historic step.
The call was included in the accusations released on Thursday, and the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office in the upcoming 2020 presidential election to seek intervention in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from ministerial-grade computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu, concerned about the composition of the judging committee
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasccus, expressed concern about the composition of the next Ghana Football Association (GFA) review committee.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davidis and expressed dissatisfaction with it.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Mr. Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the results of the judging process and that it was fair or questionable to include the president.
The review committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside of the previous interests, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kwak Parma about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that his commission should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if the Olympic Committee member Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after the ceremony held at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19 and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis, Chairman of Corporate Governance Consultants, and Mr. Marian Baranoa, a lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Akpocavi, a sports director.
A survey of the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54 and 2 percent of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture believe that the minimum wage should be 1,000 yen.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% of new graduates and middle-aged regular employees, and only 30% of non-regular employees were employed.
The number of companies who answered "approved" to raise the yen was 100 percent, construction (70, 6 percent), and wholesale (61, 7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent), including eating and drinking, and lodging.
The representative of the meeting said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with a lot of parts and hours.
The average amount of money paid was 895 yen (from 4 October to 829 yen in Fukui Prefecture).
After hearing the hiring status of the company in March 2007, there were 61 and 3 percent hiring of regular employees, 54 and 5 percent hiring of mid-term employees, and 15-4 percent of non-regular employees.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44 and 7 percent, 50 and 3 percent, while non-regulars remained 31 and 1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (37.5%, 37.5%) and construction (24, 1 percent, 38 and 1 percent) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% were employed, and in many cases the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (in three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There was also a view to encouraging students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15-3 percent said that the government has already approved the sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy.
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one-third of the total was admitted.
The company was 64 and 4%, with construction (82,8%), retail (73,1%) and manufacturing (72,7%).
The survey was conducted between July 19 and August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiplic said, "I'm here to show you now," when Wales celebrates the World Cup Tennozan and Australia, which will determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Walla Beads, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will probably be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory was the 14th win against Wales, Tiprick and his team would be one straight line for England's best eight races.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to win and finish at the top of the group."
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last autumn.
I think Australia will be blamed for returning the loan, but I will do my best to win it again.
I knew this game was a mountain before I came here.
And I came here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one match for Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa in the past World Cup.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the total score for the Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight 3 team was only 7 out of 41.
Wales finished 13th in the November Test Match Australia match last year, but Tiprick included several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiplic said, "It's hard to answer.
Certainly the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it would be impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed that the score was much narrower than actually."
In order to win Wales, the key is the breakdown battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Back Law.
Up to now, Tiplic has played 67 international matches, and has played several matches and two players in the past, and knows what is waiting for.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you're going to face a tough match.
They are always the best in the world.
I am fully aware of what kind of game will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in defensive battles, and Michael is an aggressive backs, but it may be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when needed.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself rather than confronting the background.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against them, you have to keep yourself up.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings '90 percent of the gala', would it really be a gift from a comedian?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
At the press conference on July 22, President Akihiko Okamoto said, "The company is 9 and there is no talent at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
If the ratio of "9:1" is 90% to Yoshimoto, it is considered that there were gifts from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and the view of investors who were taxing is also streamed on Twitter.
If the gala was "9:1," would there be a gift tax?
i heard from you.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax first.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen was "9:1," the profit of 1 million yen in sales and 10 million yen in expenses will be 9 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you are wondering about allocation, it doesn't mean that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount I received is reported as sales.
If the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent was an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) away from the original market for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as this time, no third party will decide on how much tax appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think that one yen payment statement is a poison.
[Interviewing Tax Rishi] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working at a bank, after graduating from university, he registered as a tax accountant in 2008 (registered books, financial statements, corporate tax law, income tax law, inheritance tax law).

It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for accounting beginners.
the white house, the impeachment's apprehension.
On Thursday, the White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party, explaining that this week's "big panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have been increasing concerns, anxiety, and concerns about the possibility that the appeal of the whistleblowers would damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't really know what it is."
The White House officials joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, or that the normal measures that the President had made to successfully deal with the matter could not be applied, so the claim was so serious that there was no confidence in how to proceed, "It seems not to be erased from the next news."
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" because the President's response to the impeachment was delayed and the prospect of "injuring the hand."
Another source of concern is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is seen to be raised every day, and there are also close associates of the president who are looking to act "impulsive."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable actions and concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means are spurred by concerns about Presidents and politics in the environment of election years.
Trump has faced the greatest threat ever before in his term of office, and has changed his hands by becoming an attacker, becoming a defense, and reviving his strategy that he considered effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Morel.
Trump tried to lighten the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of the political opponents, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for partisan conflict.
However, many White House officials have endured the Mora investigation, but this time they began to feel the difference.
The president, who is said to be a brand, said that he seemed to be attending the press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about the alleged Russian investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers have been aware of the fact that Trump, Volozimir Zerensky, and Ukrainian presidents did not have direct information on the call, arguing that it is a fact that undermines the credibility of the whistleblower and are confident that damage can be reduced.
In addition, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic family, close to the White House, points out that the basic support of the President is already very high and the effect of impeaching new supporters will not be much.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the president for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those who claim impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how uncertain the response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the plan, this initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as strategic decision rooms will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations activities in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum of the publication and publication of critical internal accusations to impeach the Democratic Party.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic viewpoints is clearly visible, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Steven Mushins, who stated that they would not publish notes on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president after 48 hours.
According to a person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called Trump's external pitbull and Corrie Luwandouski, who was the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we haven't talked with the president or close adviser about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external lawyer Jay Scorpo is also involved in impeachment efforts.
In an interview with NBC News, Crow replied, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmet Frad, who was engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Morler investigation, left Pat Ciporon, the current White House legal adviser, with less experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
Details of the White House's strategy are generally aware that officials are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but that they need personnel who can be organized and lead all their efforts to respond and political struggle.

(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from distant love is a minority.
Nikkei Doors Editor C is in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested in distance and the two become stronger," but in the first place, is distance love going well?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa The survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered that, according to the data, only 16% of couples who came from distant love to marriage.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the other person (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (artificial touch), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long-distance love, there are many cases where you can hear your voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to your opponent's house, you will be burdened with the time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and your body is on holiday to heal your work fatigue.
I feel refreshed when I go home.
Is that the only way to break apart when you get far away?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently or a couple whose distance period is determined beforehand.
You'll be engaged one year later or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you do not see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Devin Nunes seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, in a comment defending the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive of the House Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about the internal accusations Trump had asked for the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It would be natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party was so successful in impeaching this president within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes, HuffPost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to examine the truth of the Democratic Party.
The only response to this was the House of Representatives Jim Heims of the Connecticut Democratic Party, but many other members questioned whether the answer was a red-naked truth.
Memediate dotcom speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that are said to have been written in the steel document.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected shocking claims against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected by Trump in a hotel in Moscow, looking at the urination of prostitutes.
Origami, wallet and real card.
Money transfer, loan, insurance, investment - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to transfer money (moving) in addition to payments made by Origin Pay.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investment, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and Representative Director of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the challenges of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have the Origami ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get information timely.
In addition, he explained that by expanding the app not only on the Origami app but also on partner companies, it would be possible to use the service even if it did not have the Origami app.
In terms of financing, we introduced the function of post-payment in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were needed suddenly, the Origami app was completed from application to repayment.
In terms of insurance, as a partner, he introduced Aioi Nisei Insurance and First Life.
The two companies will use their data and knowledge to develop insurance products in line with life events.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually through registration of necessary administrative agencies.
New business for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that it would launch a new business that would support effective utilization of data, including data held by companies, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its payment function provided by Origami.
Origami recognizes that effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge in partner companies that partner with Origami, such as sales, acquisition of unstructured data in real society, accumulation, processing, and analysis of such data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with its payment data by Pay and structured data owned by partner companies.
It aims to contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models utilizing digital technology and data.
Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies gather various data and make customer contact," and explained, "In the next phase, how to use data to develop business models is key."
"We want to create next phase innovation by combining the data we built on the Origami Network and the data from many companies."
Details of the service will be announced sequentially.
In addition, the Origami Conference 2019 will provide the convenience of mobile technologies, such as providing coupons to smartphones after rain.
In addition, Origami Pay is now fully compensated for compensation for unauthorized use, but it is clarified as a system in terms of use.
In addition, he announced that he will work as a supporter in cooperation with the Tourism Association.
On September 7, a ceremony was held in Aweena Osaka, Osaka City to commemorate the singer Mitoko Ogasawara, who died at the age of 100 this year.
the people involved showed the representative songs of Ogasawarasan
Approximately 140 people from Japan participated, including the chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Mr. Masaaki Yunaga, and Mr. Yukie Ikebe, chairman of the Japan-Korea Music Arts Exchange Association.
At the ceremony, President Yukie IKEBE greeted me.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I still can't believe that the teacher died."While preparing for "Remembers," Ms. Mitsuko Ogasawara felt how wonderful and great he was.
On the other hand, he said, "If we can expand our meetings even if we can."
After the silence was dedicated, the Messe-ji, which was sent by Mr. Kenichi Onoe of the Korea Arts Exchange Association and the International Institute of Chuchu Thought, was introduced.
the possibility of exhaust gas reduction in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only airplane to fly in the sky and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, launched the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as fats, livestock rendering, and canola oil from restaurants.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low-quality fats in production, with a carbon release of 85% less than crude fuel, and other industrial waste in the production process.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology achieved is hydrocarbons of molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technologies tend to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is something like a dilemma," Bresler said.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as biofuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bresler described the second option as "can be tested with nuclear reactors to change chemical reactions a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Fortune Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes."
I want to prepare an alternative to the worst case.
Currently, Fog operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin to help build 2500 million production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler says that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher for fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decision given.

【High School Entrance Examination 2020】Hokkaido Public High School Entrance Examination (Recemam) - Yahoo! News
The Hokkaido Board of Education announced on September 26, 2019, the selection of students enrolled at Hokkaido High School in 2020.
The gender field is abolished in the form of entrance examination due to consideration of transgender students who do not match their mind and body.
Selection schedule
The selection of applicants for Doritsu High School is summarized in one book, including selection schedules, recruitment personnel, application qualifications, application procedures, application changes, academic examination, passing announcements, etc.
It includes selection of general admissions, selection of recommendation applicants, selection of students enrolled in Doritsu High School, and selection of applicants for applications from outside Hokkaido.
Until the selection of applicants for the 2019 academic year, the gender field was established in the entrance examination, but due to the need for appropriate consideration for the diversity of individual sexual orientation and gender identity, the selection of applicants for the 2020 academic year cut the "sex" field from the style of the entrance examination.
Students are required to study the language, mathematics, society, science, and English.
English listening tests are included in the English test time.
Each exam takes 50 minutes.

Boris Johnson warns that if Brexit is over, the UK will face riots like Los Angeles, and the prime minister will call for calm.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a risk that a violent uprising by the people would occur in this country.
The Prime Minister's officials warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that he "nearing needs to be reduced" to political words exchanged with intense speech, but insisted that he would not use the term "default."
Despite the appeal of the prime minister to regain his calm, one minister told the Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Yellow Best Movement or the Los Angeles Riot in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement -- they've encrypted their phone and compiled a demo, and then a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who were beaten by black taxi driver Rodney King to a verdict of innocence.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government protesters wearing eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers noted Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives, stating that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first result, there would be a risk of "a violent uprising by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to run a general election and leave Breguet's decision to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing the House Rebellion, which lowers demands for EU withdrawal and instead calls for a compromise to hit the EU.
(TeNY TV Niigata) - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, Niigata Albirex BB, a professional basketball player, prayed for a victory over the B League for less than a week.
Niigata Albirex BB players and staff prayed for victory at Komachi Shinmeigu Shrine in Niigata City on the morning of the 27th.
Last season, Niigata won the club's first district championship.
However, after the end of the season, Davante Gardner was transferred to other teams in the B League.
This season, with new foreign nationals, Nick Perkins, we aim to win more than last season.
"It is important to raise the speed part of the head coach's demand and the strength of the defense more than last season," said Jun Uzawa.
The opening match of Niigata will be played against Albuquerque Tokyo on Saturday, October 5.
Pakistan, the older brother of social media celebrity, was sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is long and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the incident fades.
"It takes too long, so people forget" women's rights activist Farzana Bali, Pakistan's first gender college founder, added that even the case of Barochi, which is attracting attention, took more than three years to solve.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "principal murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the actual number of honorable homicides is much more than that, because it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorable homicides occurring every year around the world are occupied by Pakistan.
Countermeasures against pork cholera 1.3 billion yen To add to the September supplementary plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo! News

floods and chaos caused by prolonged monsoons
The Monsoon season in India is about a month long, with unprecedented rainfall that killed buildings and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month is usually 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, Monsoon will weaken in the last few decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune in the western part of India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays killed several buildings and became a catastrophe.
The houses are flooded, and the residents walk through the streets with water on their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Laguna, and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In the northern part of Uttarakand, heavy rains caused damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
For farmers, prolonged monsoons are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarakand, said, "Now we're making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables are rotting in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak Monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pens) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees (about 1 pound).
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dašera on 8 October, where Hindus set up Ravana, the evil smiling figure of the beard-boom that appears in the huge comic book-style doll, the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if the Monsoon pulls long, it may be Ravana who laughs at the end.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
The latest research shows that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to male groups who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the research.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Cakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this study may not be applied to women or other races because it is only for Japanese-American males.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the greatest effect within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably due to the increased importance of other factors related to aging, which hides the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko intervention at the meeting of zerensky Trump
The U.S. President Donald Trump's impeachment process was a dramatic week in Washington politics.
For political beginners, Volozimir Zerensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump phone issue so far, and is there a wide range of influence on Zerensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zerensky that the U.S. had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on specific proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's objection of 100% rather than 1000 percent is considered controversial.
Zerensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian president Petro Poloshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no previous support from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he thanked the EU for its support including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voyticus said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then asked Zerensky to investigate two rather than one, the first being against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is an investigation on the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hinder European relations or lay backwater against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone.
"I would like to thank those who helped me with the announcement of a call record," Zerensky said at the New York General Assembly.
Zerensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards for international civil aviation.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety prize was awarded to Ghana, who won 89.89% of the effective implementation rate provisionally, and was awarded the highest score in Africa by Air Safety Director.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activity (ICVM) on April 3, 2019, following the United Nations Air Force's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was approved by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding safety in airports and their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's long-running zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for safety evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Minister of Aviation Joseph Kofi Ada Ghana, Director of Civil Aviation Simon Alati Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aico Otou to Canada, and Director of Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Benad Aliu, stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to remain aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also said that the award was a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's intractable efforts and perseverance.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a tremendous potential to develop the domestic economy, as aviation is likely to dramatically change our lives.
There are social and economic benefits, but they are all safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump appoints Peter Gino as FEMA Chief: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Secretary of State for Emergency Management Peter Gino smiled at the National Security Senate Committee meeting at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Director of FEMA, was the deputy director of government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been absent from the Senate since March, when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, stated that Mr. Long had illegally used government-owned cars to commute between Washington and his home, Norcarorina, and resigned.
Mr. Jeffrey Baiard, who had been nominated for one, raised suspicions that he was drunk and involved in the riots, and was excluded from the selection at the beginning of this month after the examination.
Mr. Gayno's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of Senate approval is required.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he was on duty at the Emergency Management Authority in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in San Gabriel Valley
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity of the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 pm, suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of Butanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was discovered at an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators also found equipment stuffed with a bayp cartridge.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
Captain Cano said that he had previously been engaged in drug investigations and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used in the Bayp product.
"The static electricity from clothes can only be ignited, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," he said.
In addition, if there were multiple containers, the whole building could be blown away not only by fire one after another.
The group was summoned to an empty office to seize illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately disclosed.
He received an anonymous information and told the investigators that it led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activity.
The investigators are still pursuing who is the black curtain of illegal baby activity.
The police said that the office was empty and that Zhang himself had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police said that they would like to receive recent news, especially about the dangers of bating, tend to be illegal bating products and not go out again.
Captain Cano said, "It's a substitute that doesn't know whether it's real or not."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our community and children, so police always warn people not to approach these activities.

Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was woven with silver foil yarn from the finest camlet silk, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Ellery Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, is determined to be one point.
Lin saw this fading piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in the countryside, which was placed there 100 years ago, and is thought to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this luxurious cloth used as the altarpiece of the church in Bactton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited at the Hampton Court Palace next month, near exactly the room where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one other dress left in the 16th century was found in the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of the sleeves to the dress, the study of the three years increased the conviction of experts that the dress was not part of the royal possession.
The high-priced textile "Silver silk cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but the quality of plants and flower embroidery also suggests that the patterns of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later were noble figures.
It is believed that the dress was equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions when it was produced.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen would be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace or would not be tolerated by rivals wearing such luxurious clothing.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues.
I was always happy to hear that the cloth was amazing, and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of a dress that was cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Bactton is not as expected.
Bactton is a village from Brunswick Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and is said to have long been associated with Parley.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, the dress must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and fine surgical needles, the altarpiece fabric is expected to be exhibited next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and the work was directed by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with the historic fabric, you're truly respectful of the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidery on the front and back, you will be very respectful to those who made it.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched for" A week after the missing female child, the Self-Defense Force withdrew The volunteer male is missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week since the first-year-old girl in elementary school disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces have not yet been able to find any clues, and on the 28th, they closed the search and withdrew.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw the request, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk such as mountain slopes and Sawa.
On the 27th, there was no way to find a 20-year-old man who volunteered for the search.
The police and firefighters will continue their search from 6:30 am on 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
As a result of the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation, with only 0.71 votes in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 votes in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member is the lowest in the country in July.
In the first oral speech held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that "the value of one vote was inequality and constitutionality."
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendants called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It is not possible that the issue of constitutionality was in a significant inequality, but should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th (JAXA provided)
The unmanned spacecraft, Konotori 8 (JAXA), carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) with an altitude of about 400 kilometers, arrived near the station on the night of 28th.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, the speed difference is eliminated and the distance is about 10 meters.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters in length is the flow that grabs the supply machine.
The aircraft had about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After installation on the station, the flight attendants carry luggage.

Chicago After the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Control Authority (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose.
McNight said that 90% of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named El Mencio Servantes.
Chief investigator Matthew Donahew DEA in Mexico said, "Mencho is DEA and indeed, the top priority of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug production sites in the dense forest of El Mencho were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva, is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel has sold "massive" cocaine, methane phenyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California for 30 years, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobility unit.
From the deaths of six Mexican helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho dies without being punished.
In recent years, thousands of murders have been caused by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic, so it is necessary to wear protective clothing when handling it.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the solder.
More than one third is thought to be made by El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahew said, Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively steal the lives of innocent women and children.
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said that it was "probably" drugs brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, Playstation 4 surprise news, PS4 game was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to Last of As.
Some of the video footage of this new action game was presented to fans.
More details have been published several days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in many ways.
The last of the two parts that have never been seen since the PSwan era have been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Notydog Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous work, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to tell the story that there were so many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all the other sections started."
The game was very large and did not enter a single Blu-ray, making it two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are difficult to open at work.
Although it is not possible to ruin this surprise, Easter eggs in the game contain nostalgic notydog works.
When the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 limited to PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently released the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replica, a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "help" Council Trys Residents wish to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th day of Noto Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, mobile sales began by the Noto Island Regional Development Council, which was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagon cars with daily necessities, seasonings, and food crossed the Susomachi-kai and Hanura-machi-kai on the first day.
Some of the products were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents said they wanted to continue saying, "It's fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, designated garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiro gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Suso Town Council, the residents' columns were formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the Council expressed his surprise that "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I don't know when my father can drive, I hope he will continue."
Users also received orders such as "I want you to have a cup of coffee, not a can coffee, but a cup of coffee that drips on your own."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to help "shopping weak."
Until December, we will consider whether the 20-machi-kai in the island will be held once a month and whether it will continue as a business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he decided to provide additional $100 million to drought-stricken residents.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been reviewed significantly to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be allocated to the drought-stricken community support organization and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-stricken areas, each of the 13 municipalities will receive up to US$100 million of drought relief funds for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional assistance, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion in budget for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of his five children.
The authorities said on July 9, 2014, Haskell was pushed into his house and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old son, 9 and 7 years old daughter died.
Only one person in his family, the fifteen-year-old Cashy Stay, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that he was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed until the day of the month.
"If you choose to disappoint us, never forgive us."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook her anger resonated with the leaders of other countries.
Global warming increases.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
They boycotted classes and sat in front of the parliament, and became a fireman to spread school strikes around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and irritation protested all over the world, including Japan.
It is estimated that about 4 million people participated in more than 150 countries.
Morioka also marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will start in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century, and to reduce the temperature rise from before the industrial revolution by less than two degrees.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to be associated with global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is followed by various regions.
In order to increase global warming at a faster pace, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit held by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal of virtually zero by 50 years.
Other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century.
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
The Minister of the Environment, Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's efforts at the Environment-Related Meeting, said in a press conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool and sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The damage that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "replacement of issues" that the person himself opposes.
There is no longer a grace to combat global warming, and the international community must respond to the common human crisis.
The efforts of each country can not be effective enough.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
Adults should act so that they don't take the future.

The research results of the United States Army led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to secure military security, measure and time functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute distributed quantum information center of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, which is funded by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between materials and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state and the measurement is performed on one side, even if the other quantum bits are physically distant, the measurement results are affected by the other.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Dr. Ben Lañon, an experimental physicist at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network of physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distances.
Researchers say that the variance of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum network use.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and then excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, which is immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Dr. Lañon.
In his team, he first sent the light particles through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, the optimal value of long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured simultaneously with high-quality "clock" quantum bits, which leads to the realization of an entangled network of long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army from the perspective of accurate positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications," said Dr. Frederick Fatemi, an Army researcher who co-operated this program.
