Croatia is planning nuclear treatment facilities, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwest Bosnian towns and protested the next Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
Demo participants gathered in the town of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly urged Croatia to abandon plans to store the remains of the barracks in Trugovska Gola, and vow to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future" and "We need a hard stop" said that nuclear waste disposal facilities could threaten the lives of about 250,000 residents in the Una and its surroundings.
We must oppose it.
The head of the municipality of Novi Grado, Miloslav Driaka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and rivers.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided to build its own storage facility, or to pay for the cost of the waste of Croatia being processed at newly constructed facilities.
Croatian Minister of Environmental and Energy, Tomislav Chorich, told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public facilities waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket be the best place in Croatia?"
Don't allow us to hurt our self-esteem!

The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are sick.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinnes Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, despite the fact that humans under their protection are not seriously ill.
There are many different types of pathological conditions, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is hypothesized to be a disease.
However, the proxy Munchhausen syndrome is clearly false that other people under their protection are ill.
This is also known as FII, counterfeiting or induction disease, and is a type of child abuse.
Although it is unusual, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what is the sign of the proxy Munchhausen syndrome?
Although the symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, NHS provides the following precautions.
Children are healthy, but if they are ill, they try to calm down the medical staff.
It can be described in detail or false symptoms.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as by mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Overdose medications and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How general is Münchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.
what should we do if we suspect a child's damage?

Nigeria: police force investigation into caduna schools, rescue 300 children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
Police said the children were placed in a humanitarian environment, but the school denied this.
The school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
The parents came to deliver a meal to their children every day, so they knew what the environment was.
It was very surprising that the police came and evacuated the children, and that the parents had all the food they had delivered, so they closed the school.
There are parents who can testify whether the police had put children in such a terrible environment, but this is an unfair treatment."
He added that the former Police Headquarters Chief Abdullahman had visited once to confirm what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Corlan and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Corlan, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Pope, AI development, based on public interests, warned IT representatives
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors that if there was no moral assessment of public interest on Friday, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference, where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethicists met.
In the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference proved to be the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in the discussion of potential and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increased mechanical work, and examples of the gunfire incident in Christchurch, New Zealand and the responses of social media companies during the atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if we rely too much on robotics to pursue profit, we may also be afraid to take away human dignity.
"If the advancement of technology causes increasingly noticeable inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will be counterproductive to a certain kind of savage based on strong theories.
According to the host of the conference, the participants will use their expertise to find the future advisers of the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.

Martin Woodegor showed a surprise support for Michel Oyalusabar.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, breaking the record in the current domestic season, and winning the top position in La Liga.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, Zinedine Zidane has been under tremendous pressure due to the intense open battle and the public discontent with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champigns League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan.
Vinicius Juniole is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.

Anna Hazale, and Sharad Powerle's name was surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When we contacted this lawsuit, the name of Sharad Powerle was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the name of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Bureau (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Amit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, accused of the name of former staff of the former chairman of the bank, Agit Powerl and 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit came, the name of Sharad Powerle was nowhere.
Asked about the alleged action by the executive and the alleged involvement of Sharad Powerle in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name emerged or who mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that if the executive conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerle denied any misconduct and claimed that the joint bank had nothing to do with it, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the October 21 elections in Maharashtra.
The former coalition minister clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
The NCP referred to the lawsuit by the Executive Bureau as a political summary.

In particular, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistake by elderly drivers is increasing.
In particular, when you start suddenly, you will be panicked and the accelerator will remain on the brake pedal.

After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] The "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot informs you of pedal mistakes from a new perspective.
The pedal mistake is to be avoided by " alarm sound."
The mechanism causes " alarm sound" when stepping on the accelerator pedal by mistake with the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, it is possible to avoid rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the mistake.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who can easily hear.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.

When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantly control the advance by turning it into a creep running state (where the brake is removed in the D range).
At the back of the vehicle, it is equipped with a function to detect the speed of about 5Km/h and force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The mounting is only possible with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

"Because adults were busy cleaning up the house and didn't have enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can't panic and say that children are okay."
Yukari Okushi (36) in Shiraishi-cho spent a night at a shelter town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
"If there is a child who can't stay still, I'll feel around it."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend my time at home as much as possible in the event of a disaster with food and simple toilets.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparations will change in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinko Kawazaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, with a child aged six and eight, proposed that " elementary school had a closed school e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or email system.
There was also a request to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I don't know what it was like last time."I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
Mr. Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions presented will be communicated to the government as a group."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Urcuri and the police supervisory authority.
The police agency (IOPC) will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandal in London's mayor's office as a violation of criminal law.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts on acts" on suspicion that Mr. Curi had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"The matter of conduct exists in the presence of information indicating that crime could have been done."
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC was an agency that responded to accusations issued by police in England and Wales.
The problem was entrusted to the police supervisory authority because Johnson was in a position comparable to the police chief at that time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information about his relationship with Arcuri, although he claimed it was "constitutional."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but the press reported that the Americans who moved to London seven years ago had paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the mayoral period of London, and that Johnson and others were given preferential treatment to participate in three foreign trade dispatches.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to the hacker house, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked puzzled questions about the survey process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Digital Department has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arcuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between Prime Minister and female businessmen was "public secret among employees."
The move of GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory authority touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The director did not submit any evidence for any charges, and prior to the news reports issued late on Friday night, the Prime Minister was not given the opportunity to reply to the director."
The public and the mass media will see the political kyogen that was organized by the people.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division was "public secret."
The former staff of London & Partners (L&P) said that despite some of the people who had considered the company "untrustworthy" at that time, he was privileged to accompany him to a trade-related talks abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
The 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard about the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Sawakami Susumnobu.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all those involved, not just the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of supporting the formation of property for ordinary people.
This spirit has remained unchanged, and has been pursuing for 20 years.
When the general public gets rid of the anxiety of money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operations do not yield results if they do not walk with beneficiaries.
A lot of money comes from the "Sawakami Fund" when the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have been talking about since our time, "We will support companies that are needed in the world."
We believe that this is the reason why we have become a long-term fund for 20 years and that we have continued to be a direct sales system that can deliver messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc. miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling oxycodon counterfeit pills containing fenthanyl before Miller accidentally overtakes cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl before he died, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petitt had received drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "delivery."
All three of them were not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there was still an argument about the individual case.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for the 2005 drug case, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The prosecutors in charge of the case, first reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the trial began due to the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to the phone call to the lawyer.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller from Pittsburgh, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, but was defeated in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video to his Instagram and released a song called "Suncue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died related to opioid drug abuse in recent years.
The rock band Three Doors Down guitarist Matthew Roberts died of drug overdose in 2016 and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, the spelling of Walter's name was corrected by Stephen instead of Steven.
Nine-year-old Nigerians, more than 30 mobile games
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch2 to create a hidden game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, animations and stories on and off-line.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats out of hiding places.
He learned how to make games in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN that he spent time building games when he was bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course hosted by Codefest International was introduced to give children such as Basil a chance to experience new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in numerous mobile games.
"Basil always took a cell phone and played games, so when I was four I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, he became interested in Basil's game production.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but how do you make games yourself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basil has been interested in learning how to make his own games and asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has named the game as its contents.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world and the younger generation, like Basil, is led by African innovation.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded a robot that uses program code to divide housework.
In May, the girls' high school team, Akrobot, won the 2019 Robofest competition.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to falsely testify to federal agents investigating corruption related to major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes pleaded guilty next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Haze recognizes.
Hayes was initially accused of conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor accused Hayes of being involved in a plan for a senior insurance company to fund the state's insurance director's campaign.
Major Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cozy.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindbergh supported Republican principles and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer asked him to comment on Friday and email, but he did not reply.
On Friday, Hannes Davis, the defendant of Hayes, also called for additional comments by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes did not speak with Corsey about the State Insurance Bureau staff.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about requests from state insurance supervisors and personnel transfers from Lindbergh.
The prosecutor said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Corsey, and also discussed direct bribes with the director.
The indictment published in April claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to raise $2 million to campaign for Cosey's reelection in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the officials who had reviewed Lindberg's company.
Republican Corsey reported alleged attempted bribes to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no doubts.
In an indictment, a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cosey states that Lindbergh co-owners instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cosey's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would draw attention if he could move so expensive money, but he eventually broke up in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
i know, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an e-mail asking for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like to post others!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, liked! became an individual and only posted.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager Mia Garrick said that this change was based on feedback from mental health professionals who would consider the number of happy surveys and goodies to cause social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had a very positive feedback from many bullying groups and mental health organizations that are working together."
It is only to remove numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange rather than the number of good or reaction.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
It is very early to test in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test ends or changes.
"We initially had positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now we listen to feedback and learn," Garrick said.
Garrick in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very aggressive "technologies" Facebook and Instagram user.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag and I couldn't move anywhere.
If my favorite bag is broken, I want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was Cando's handicraft parts that helped me at that time.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, the chin is the ultimate Petit Pra goods.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main body greatly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this connected fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
Originally it is a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
It was planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle, and we bought two items.
The size of the ring is small, but if you put it on one side of the bag, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is attached tightly.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The number of fittings has increased, but because of the lighter parts, the weight has no problem.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts has increased and the design level has improved.
The express "Aso" of the JNR is a temporary train, Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours journey | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train with the image of the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded 12 blue passenger cars from Hiroshima Station, leaving Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, a tour was organized.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo Line, Chikuho Line, and Kagoshima Line.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother lives in prison for the honor murder of a Pakistani social media star, kandir barochi.
Candy Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of murder of his sister on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment in honor of his father-in-law, Pakistan.
An introverted self-portrait photograph - the extent that it is not large in Western standards, but Baroch, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
A few days later, at a press conference, he said, "Of course," he murdered his sister, saying that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
The lawyer said, "Inshirar, the thought of God, will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that he wanted his son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Baroch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a lightening of the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "principal murder."
The woman chooses her own marriage partner, and in the case of Baroch, she burns, kills, stabs or strangles her family with crimes such as praise for her sexuality.
The murder is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow the perpetrators to be pardoned from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring lifetime imprisonment for honorable murder.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted that his son be pardoned.
However, the sad parents, thinking about losing their son, changed their minds and told them to forgive their son.
In response to international hate for murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistani cricket team, and wearing a bright red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although critical and threatening, it was recognized by many, including young people, that the new heaven and earth were opened in a country considered to be a bold political activity to express oneself as a presence like Kim Kardashian.
The origins of the "principal" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly in women's behavior, although men may be victims.

[Okinagarabe General Bureau] The NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda, Amami City) and the Okinagara Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda, China Town) signed a partnership to support the promotion of remote islands.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects implemented by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish mutual support systems in terms of health management and prevention of injuries, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both organizations mediate and dispatch exclusive trainers and instructors for training related to sports, and share information.
When teams from remote islands travel outside the island, they will work to solve problems such as the burden of travel and the difficulty of trainers.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association with the ASA, in the event of a tournament on the mainland, such as a prefectural tournament, support is provided to prevent the player from losing their performance due to fatigue during a boat trip or staying overnight.
In addition, during the competition on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, the team will cooperate with local recoil clinics and hospital officials to support players from outside the island.

Kenichiro Shigeki: "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Shigeki has been thinking twice about "mote."
The brain science theory is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article) Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko adheres to the traditional "man's fantasy" and is overwhelmingly lacking in pattern learning for mote!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool man.
if you're stuck in it, you'll live.
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about various works, people's behavior, and daily pattern learning.
When we learn patterns, the brain can systematically act like this, so I think we will be able to live in Lak.
I think I am still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I am "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit tough if you're stuck with the old pattern of "a university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say what you should do or what you should do, you will live.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I've been talking about that in my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is.
The "heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by admitting people around him.
It's not that easy.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
I think Mr. Takeshi was doing this at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, you can't make it lightly if you're stuck in the sense.
As far as I have heard from many women, regardless of their position or age, it seems to be a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to know what this "cute" is.

Nigeria's illegal northwest, doubling the number of refugees to 40,000: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled in the last four months due to increased violence.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has emerged, and by the end of this year, each institution will cooperate to raise funds for $35.5 million.
UNHCR spokesman Babar Barok said that the Islamic militant Boko Haram, who has been active in the northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Nigeria in the last 10 months in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina was by organized armed groups.
"We often show the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok told reporters on Friday.
The media reported that kidnappings, torture, assaults, murders and sexual violence were frequent, and raiders destroyed residences and thefts.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Boko Haram and the West African branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," Barrok says.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR announced in a statement that, in particular, the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the coming months.
the men who murdered two women and two children were confirmed.
The guatemara men's trial date was confirmed to have killed two women and two children in Iowa.

In recent years, in response to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year in collaboration with media companies to directly purchase advertising frames in response to advertisers' requests.
This time, the introduction of LFP will be expanded in response to header binding.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header binding allows them to participate in bidding directly to the header binding target advertising frame, which is expected to improve the delivery of ads.
In addition, due to the limited number of media companies in the target market, the advertising frame of the destination is secured along with individual commercial materials and brand images to prevent damage to brand value.
The benefit of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each Vidder company, called "Lapper Solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, will enable efforts to meet the needs of media companies.

Two months of suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata at Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that a male assistant professor at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the General Affairs Department, Assistant Professors of the University of Tokyo, from around October 2017 when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, were emotionally motivated and abused in inappropriate words.
He was a teacher of education and was certified to have worsened the learning environment.
Several students appealed to the survey conducted in September 18.
The management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and from December of the same year, they conducted an investigation at the Harasssment Prevention Committee by teachers at Yonezawa Campus.
Based on the findings from the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the board members decided to disciplinary action.
As an assistant professor, he continued his education after the survey, but his actions were improved through interviews and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to make every effort to prevent harassment and restore confidence."
The university also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students led by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts Boris Johnson demands to reduce EU withdrawal demands and make compromises with the EU.
Just three weeks after the EU summit meeting, the Prime Minister's concern is growing around the Prime Minister.
Boris Johnson faces a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of withdrawal from the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system instead of a backstop clause related to the Irish border are tight, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative to "impossible."
The senior ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose a compromise proposal, such as setting a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings without agreement and insist that the EU will accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One cabinet member said that the ruling that the Supreme Court's closing session was illegal on Tuesday would be "a warning," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House of Representatives, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his steps.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and the Camings project is clearly failing.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to carry out an agreement with Prime Minister Terryza May, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many things that everyone is trying to end.
If we postpone it, Boris will end and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer condemned Boris not seriously thinking about negotiations.
In a harsh speech, the former leader of the Conservative Party said, "The Prime Minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we do not see the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Uerres, and discussing with the people at large streets.
The prime minister's spokesman admitted yesterday that the agreement was still a long way ahead, saying, "If anyone can't think of it, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben bill to force a three-month delay if an unconfirmed withdrawal would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are working hard to keep moving forward despite the legislation has been enacted."
The European Union Delegation Minister Stephen Berkeley returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two discuss how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorain Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by television bosses that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would not succeed in the absolute television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for TV-am Scotland branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast, and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorraine.
In commemoration of his 35th anniversary, he broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
"The passion and enthusiasm" and "the curiosity" were the secret to survival in the television industry, and the moderator said, "We have to put it into work."
To be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that it was "very painful" to investigate the Dunbrane shooting.
The day after the horrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't even think that many of the families of children who were killed or injured were watching us broadcast live broadcasts from Dunbulane.
Pam Ross, who was killed by her mother and five-year-old daughter Joanna, personally told me to meet me, so we talked for hours at her house.
I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very hard" and that "we really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of the presidency from the late President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to fears that it might be a trap to identify military action in November 2017.
During the coup d'état, the Zimbabwe Independent reported that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the defense forces.
However, Chiwenga refused the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform leaders and African Unions around the world that he was stripped of the regime in a coup, rather than anxiety, and government officials reported on social media.
According to a series of Twitter by Jamwanda2, officials confirmed that he was a high-ranking official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has held the administration for 37 years, is willing to give the administration to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munnagagwa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was carried out by three.
President Spokesman George Charanba, then head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Nepera, and the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Muconoli, were involved in negotiations, and their officials said.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to condemn the African Union's military action while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the president to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of the former president.
"It was a wasteful act to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerous and rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there was a little political aim of the late president who wanted to change the flow even in diplomacy alone.
If there was something to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I hope the commanders remembered that they had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not be defeated.
The late President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and crushed by the commanders' claims that he would not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, who had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when the defense forces realized they were not protected.
He was warned that he would be executed, such as Kadafi, and Mugabe would have to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that they would not turn guns to the citizens, even if they had invaded the presidential house called Brurouf.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders at that time read the intent accurately.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa (which we belong to the camouflage group) " were used in the words of an envoy to convey the desperate message of the president, officials of the government said.
The Army told the other military commanders of the region that through the military officers who stayed in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at that time, the key South Africans in this process had refused to intervene, but, as they repeatedly threatened behind it, clarified that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military had invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," said the intelligence agency.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to the ban on nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
[New York Joint] On the 26th at the UN Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and Ms. Michi Takeuchi (63) of the second generation of atomic bombings, a granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, spoke to support the treaty.
Five new countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and ratified it in 32 countries and regions.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were carried out in accordance with the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern in recent years that there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is nothing else to eliminate."
China needs strong leadership.
Before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the Chinese State Council's press said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified strong leadership, China will lead to division and collapse, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the repression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who will play the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he held power in late 2012.
Mr. Xi also oversees military modernization programs threatening the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development models, and does not intend to incorporate models of other countries.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by a strong column, and war and confusion left a deep scar with its pain; China would never bring the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficulties such as the economic downturn and the anti-government movement in Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China never abandons its core interests and does not allow security and sovereignty to be compromised.
"The tariffs that continue to rise with the threat of trade war are no problem-solving," White Paper states.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"There will never be any weakening in the trade war."
I am confident that China is facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities, and opening a new world.
Since China has no idea of combating the United States, and does not want to replace the United States, the United States should calmly grasp the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more likely to stop China's development.
The United States would not maintain strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko.
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Oteru Takayama will be acting as director and the director (responsibility teacher) will promptly decide.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that local newspapers had a rumor about baseball club members.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of a survey conducted by 66 students, the two again confirmed the facts, and the fact was generally accepted and dismissed on 28 January.
In the summer of Yokohama, Motochika WATANABE (74) who raised Shosaka Daisuke and others bravely retired.
He was the director of Hirata and the director of Kaneko.
From summer 16 to summer, he participated in the Koshien Garden in the summer for three consecutive years.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semi-finals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semi-finals and was desperate for the next spring.
The Spice Girls' MelC, a diet disorder disease, banned diet topics in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, who had not eaten any fruit or vegetable for many years, acknowledged that diet was banned at home.
Sporty spices have long been "excessive exercise" under pressure from members of the global pop group, and have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by the child rearing of his daughter Scarlett, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old, and it's getting a lot of attention to his appearance."
However, because I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's customs.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, a "bad" comment on himself in the media led to physical problems, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, became more and more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted almost a few years."
Judiciary judgment on same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's decision was made to acknowledge the fact that "marriage (internal marriage) " in accordance with marriage could be established between the same sex.
More than 20 countries have recognized same-sex marriages, and local governments, such as Sapporo City, have established a system to certify same-sex partnerships.
The court ruled that two women were actually married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to admit legal protection to same-sex couples.
As a result of the civil law and the regulation of family register law, a lawsuit seeking compensation to the country was filed in five districts including Sapporo.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system for recognizing diverse families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years, and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The ruling recognized the fact that "there is no difference between marriage between men and women" from the results of living together.
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of actual marriages with the right to conform to marriage in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of "freedom of marriage" as the marriage "only based on the mutual agreement."
Both sexes were "unprecedented at the time of the establishment of the same-sex marriage, so the purpose of denying the same-sex marriage is not understood."
"The Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," and it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits across the country.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women," the problem remained.
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect while recognizing the actual situation equivalent to between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends targeted by married women, about 70% of people considered that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" recognized by law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriage between same-sex couples, but also expansion of legal rights for married couples.
to the trial and jury of former athletes indicted for rape against multiple women.
A jury trial was held at the former Delaware University baseball player's trial where several women were accused of sexual assault.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's life luck.
A 21-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted after sending her to her home by car.
After three weeks of meeting at Bumble, Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway has been accused of sexually assaulting six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution argued that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women were inconsistent and misrepresented, and that women were regretting physical relations.

In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final round of the season, and the possibility of entering CS was lost.
In the fourth place, if Hanshin wins the remaining three games, the ranking will be changed.
At the ceremony after the match, Takashi Ogata (50) apologized, "I am sorry that I couldn't win the final game, and I couldn't confirm my position.
Some fans were invited to join.
At the end of the speech, he said, "I will do my best to take Penant in the next season."
However, after the ceremony, the press asked him about the matter, and he said, "I'm not finished yet, so I'm done."
【Dospo】Oda is the fourth and most self-proportionate number 20 after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
It became a reward for the seniors.
Four times, he was greeted by one lead, and on the left side, he made his 20th home run with a liner.
I reached the number of home runs I was aiming at, "I stopped receiving this number and tried to do it again, and I became a big one."
The director's intentions were firm.
This was the first time a four-point transfer was made.
He said, "I put it in fourth place so that I could swing by thinking."
Oda responded to his expectations: "I felt so excited and entered the game, and I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal four statues is Abe, a giant who retired from active duty this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads to victory, and the 4th is the team's 4th, and the 4th seniors who have seen the giants were."
Among them, "Abe-san's appearance comes to mind the most; he was a reliable person, and he looked at his back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, the video clearly
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest contributor to the opera house, Sirculer Key, Luna Park, and somewhat famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous harbour is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow through the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title, "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around the most popular cities in Australia often flow into the Sydney Harbour by sucking shells, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing through the road.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clogging waterways.
Dr. Katherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most modified and contaminated estuaries in Japan.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastics per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"There were heavy rains several times, but Sydney Harbour was quite tragic," Dr. Duffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, in a corner of the iceberg, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seafloor.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what the truth is there," said David Center Manley, owner Richard Nichols, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what's under the water surface), I think everyone is really cool.
It's overwhelming, but more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
Plastics are used at least somewhere in the remaining half.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe that all of these plastics and wastes are flowing down the water immediately.
Jeremy Brown, one of Ocean Protect's founders and director, said that local residents and tourists can reduce plastic and waste flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles more well, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a source of food.
However, we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old appearance, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also announced this month, as part of the activities of the Australian public to widely know about environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children aged 12 to 18 have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
The study also pointed out that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed were increasingly worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Plant was demolished in October | Saga News | Saga News
The construction of the former Karatsu power plant began in October, and the chimney of the former Karatsu power plant was Futatako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimney of the former Karatsu Power Plant (oil-fired power plant) located in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantlement was used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
One chimney is split from the top of the tower crane and dismantled.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine buildings and boilers were not destroyed.
The man in his 60s who runs a restaurant near him said, "Looking back from the far away, it's like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Plant began operation in 1967, and the first unit was closed in 89 and the second unit was closed in 2015.
It is located in the eastern part of Karatsu Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Since Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station are nearby, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine electric cars, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

They are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell their products.
I am now (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Mama Takahashi, a free announcer and a monthly commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," told his master.
my mentor's advice was to save my rotten self.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a teacher, beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I don't know what I'm doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry and how important it is to be a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was struck by being said to be a cone or a bliss, my father said, "I thought it was a cone, but it wasn't.
After that, around the second and third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty girl Anna can do it," and even when I didn't get motivated because I didn't want to do the job I wanted to do, even when my heart was rotting, "I asked everyone to do the work hard, but I was glad that I was in charge of Mama."I changed my mind by saying, "Let's appoint Mama."
i learned naturally from my father's acting.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading news, but actually after I joined the TV station, I've been in touch with news all the time with the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe praised it as "good news reading of Mama."
When I read the news, I feel it's important and sensed.
It has been cultivated by watching father's stage, film, television, and period dramas in childhood.
In other words, I think it was thanks to my father because I have a lot of experiences in my childhood.
300-year history of dance / education promotion project | Miyako Daily Newspapers Homepage - The latest news of Miyakojima is packed!
Workshops in Kagamihara
Workshop on the role and effect of the five instruments played by the ensemble dance was introduced.
The group dance workshop (hosted by the Prefectural Board of Education Education Agency) was held at Kagamihara Junior High School on September 26.
All students attended and learned about the 300-year history and birth of dance, as well as the acoustic effects and utilization of musical instruments played.
At the workshop, members of the OB Association of the Ryukyu Performing Arts Department of the Prefectural University of Arts introduced the role of each instrument in group dance while playing three lines, koto, drums, kokyu and flutes.
The host was from Miyakojima City, and Mr. Kawamakata of the OB Association gave a presentation about the charm of dance.
In this workshop, I learned about how five kinds of instruments are represented in dance by taking up "music" from three components of dance (music, chanting, Ryukyu dance).
It was explained that the three lines were an element of the movement and emotional expression of the characters along with the songs, and that the kokyu was pulled up by singing and playing the melody of the three lines.
In the latter half, the students actually touched the instrument and experienced the sound of the instrument, and felt the appeal as an instrument.
The aim of this initiative is to be familiar with Ryukyu classical music through musical instruments, and to attract many students interested in "gumi Odori," which is the first time in Miyako.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
This is the first time in the United States - Yahoo!
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The International Automobile Federation announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Looking back on the past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020.
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which Formula One (F1) and World Endurance Championship (FIA) are held.
Since 1973, the competition has been held annually to become the world's highest rally championship with history and tradition, and it is said to be the toughest car competition to run at high speeds not only on paved roads but also on gravel and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparatory Committee was established to host the event.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsports Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Shoo Toyoda (President and Representative Director of Toyota Motor Corporation) and Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation), both governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with relevant parties to ensure that we can make a big appeal to the world as the center of motorsports representing Japan, and work hard to achieve the success of the Fall 2020 Games."
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports competition for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation)
"I am very pleased to be able to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motorsports, commented on the event.
The WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Shirakucho) and Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ebisu City).
The main venue is the "Love Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
The Japan Round Preparatory Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is it the key to cancer treatment?
Tusmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could bring major reforms to patient treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells were camouflaged.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will lead to new treatments for cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing fatal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
In this study, we found that some cancer cells in humans and bags would no longer respond to markers because they used a series of proteins called PRC2 to cam fullage, and the immune system would not attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
"The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy," said Mark Dawson, researcher at Peter McClum.
Conventional treatments may be reused, revitalizing markers, proteins known as MHC, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"There is a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a worldwide disease.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where cancer cells escape detection.
"It's surprising that exactly the same process occurs (to humans and Tasmanian devil cancers)," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils so far.
However, if a drug that is effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may help control the tumor."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and amazed the solar system, orbiting a giant Jupiter-shaped planet around a small star called a red dwarf, 30 light-years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting the red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% the size of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, who led this research published in Science, said.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only significantly smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is very low to about 3800 Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why it's red."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet could have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining its elliptic orbit.
Planets are produced from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which create stars orbiting themselves.
The most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, produces objects from solid particles in the disk, and the attraction of the egg on the planet makes the surrounding gases into the atmosphere.
This unusual planetary system could be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star may be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature may have been lower."
As the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant soy dip, and a colleague in charge
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating dipping beans with awakening agents to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of transferring methane fetamine (B-grade felony) and taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were attributed to the incident that occurred at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because Medina Hernández saw him making beans dip.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returns to work, her stomach gets worse and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democratt Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have mixed methane phetamine in soy dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee told Medina Hernández that the victim's food "took the drug," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane phetamine into a soy dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows that Medina Hernández turned back to the camera and clinched behind the microwave, but pulled something out of the brager.
It is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put a soy dip in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was jailed in Marion County instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of felony by assault, robbery, sneeze, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise and frequent guests of the Royal Navy aircraft
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use a private machine that moves the royal family around the world for important events and appearances.

In a frank conversation, the former president recalled how mother and mother changed.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "It's like being a mother is in an advanced class to let go."
My job was almost always to find myself that children want to grow and stay a reasonable distance.
It is not the ideal for children as parents or the admiration of their childhood, but in essence to find out who they are.
In the interview of Good Housekeeping magazine, Mrs. Obama gave little advice to the Duchess.
sometimes the pressure from myself and people around me is too big.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't have time to do anything.
In the first few months of the White House, instead of starting to work ambitiously, the girls began to live happily in school and careed for new friends.
I think it's good, but it's better.

Trump Hotel owner's right to complain, but also holds a license to sell liquor.
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Commission dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the local Trump International Hotel's license to sell liquor because of its owner's questionability.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three MPs, two former judges and two Jewish leaders that most of the petitioners had no fixed assets in Washington State or in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on a state law that requires the applicant's "suitability" to obtain a liquor license.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year included repeated frauds against President Trump's assault and violating state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time a petition was issued to update the permit.
The honey collected by Bentley's "Fly Bees" bees is the first harvest!
How do you taste honey collected by Flying Bees bred at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September 2019.
More than 100 bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the factory grounds where cars were assembled?
I want to taste this!
Bentley's honey is here (11 pieces)
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant.
The beekeepers watched how honey bees are gathering from wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been conducting a wide range of activities through its Crew Plants and our business to become the top of sustainable luxury automakers, and is part of this.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of bentra honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to fulfill our role." In May 2019, 1.2 million bees of bees, Flying Bees, were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, it was completed to remove the nest frame from the nest box.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The label design was designed by Louise McCullum, designer of Bentley interiors.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also given to the important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
I would like to enjoy afternoon tea, not only Fennelty which is compatible with honey, but also honey from Flying Bees such as scones.
it's the worst in the u.K. in a scandalous report by the Cleveland police.
A police officer was named the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continued "a serious deterioration," says Phil Gomley.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, efforts to prevent crimes, arrest suspects and protect socially vulnerable persons were neglected.
Phil Gomley, Director of the Police Department, said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
The police chief Mike Wiel resigned in January less than a year before his appointment, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
Deputy Director Adrian Roberts was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee to investigate illegal acts because of his colleague's involvement in sexual acts.
He resigned from the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Interior Ministry intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal" and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what will happen next.
At present, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate," Pelosi told CNN in Congress.
"I'm going to do my job based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Wallodymill Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Gerensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Giulani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN reported on Thursday that it was a national security attorney in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before formal inquiries.
The Ministry of Justice, accused of inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not extend to the investigation of violations of political funds.
In response to Barr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the intelligence special committee would decide who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's name in the July telephone talks with the Ukrainian president.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be approached by the judge regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Pelosi said he was "very concerned" when Trump attacked the whistler on Thursday as a spy on the whistler.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said a terrible thing about the person who could provide information to the whistleblowers is a significant loss in the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that Trump would formally impeach the foreign leaders for political benefit and wrote a historic step.
The call was included in the accusations published on Thursdays, and the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office in the upcoming 2020 presidential election to seek intervention in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from ministerial computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu, concerns about the composition of the judging committee
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the next Ghana Football Association (GFA) election.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davidis and expressed dissatisfaction with it.
In an interview with GNA sports, Mr. Manu said that the chairman was interested in the results of the judging process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The review committee should be composed of a fair and neutral member from outside of the previous interests, whether or not they are related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Palmer about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manuel argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu said that if the Olympic Director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club, but when Mr. Palmer attended the committee, he suggested prejudice and injustice.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after taking office at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Appocavi, a sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54-2 percent of small and medium-sized firms in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage as "timely wage thousand yen."
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the scheduled number was around 50% for new graduates and middle-aged regular employees, and 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded that they "approved" to raise the hourly salary to 1,000 yen were related to information (100 percent), construction (70,6%), and wholesale (61,7%).
The majority were manufacturing (51-90%) and service businesses (60 and 9 percent), including food and drink, and lodging.
"There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs," he said.
The average amount of money paid was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, the hiring of new graduates of regular employees was 61/3 percent, mid-term employment was 54-5 percent, and non-regular employment was 15-4%.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44-7 percent for new graduates, 50-3 percent for mid-term graduates, and 31 percent for non-regular employees.
In particular, the transportation industry (including 13 and 3 percent of new graduates, 37 and 5 percent of middle school graduates) and construction industry (24, 1 percent of new graduates, 38 and 1 percent of middle school graduates) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% were employed, and in many cases, the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (in three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There was also a view to encouraging students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15-3 percent said that the government has already approved the sub-sector and/or business proposed in its growth strategy.
Including 20 and 3% of the "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the overall acceptance attitude was expressed.
The number of companies that "recognized" was 64 and 4%, and construction (82,8%), retail (73,1%), and manufacturing (72,7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tipplick said that Wales will host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Walla Beads, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will probably be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory was the 14th win against Wales, Tiprick and his team would be the best straight line for England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to challenge and end up winning at the top of the group," said Flemcher, Tiprick in Wales.
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last fall.
Australia thinks it's a lot of blame for returning the loan, but until we do our best to win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I'm here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have won only one World Cup in the past, and the victory to Wallads is the third-place victory 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the total score for the Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight 3 team was only 7 wins in 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in a test match against Australia last November, but Tiprick was included in several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
Certainly the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it was impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
In order to win Wales, the key is the breakdown battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Lowe.
Up to now, Tiprick has played 67 international matches and has played several games and two players in the past, and knows what is waiting for them.
"They're definitely a global backs player," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you'll always know that you're going to face tough games.
They are always at the highest level in the world.
I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs in the world.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself rather than confronting the very strong background.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against them, you have to keep up with yourself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
the momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you will be able to play a game that won't lose.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brought '90 percent of the gala', would it really be a gift from performers?
A series of problems with Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by the dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said in a press conference on July 22 that "the company does not have any talent at 9 or so at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha rebounded.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the ratio of "9:1," the investor's opinion that there was a gift from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and that tax was imposed was also streamed on Twitter.
If the Gala deal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
I heard from Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual, it is not subject to gift tax first.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen is "9:1," the profit of 1 million yen in sales and 10 million yen in expenses will be increased.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you are wondering about allocation, you don't have to argue that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount I received is reported as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that has been firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent was an individual.
If a transaction is made at prices that are clearly priced (e.g., real estate sales, etc.) away from the original price for tax avoidance, it is a problem to calculate taxes.
However, it is not possible for a third party to decide on how much tax-appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think it's a pity to pay for 1 yen.
[Interview cooperation tax accountant] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working at a bank, he was registered as a tax accountant in 2008 (recording, financial statements, corporate tax law, income tax law, inheritance tax law).

It is well known for its easy-to-understand explanations for beginners.
the white house, the impeachment foothold, panic.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, explaining that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Building seems to be increasing in concern, anxiety, and worries about the possibility that the appeal of the whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't really know what it is."
The White House officials joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, and that this claim was so serious that it could not be applied to the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far, that it was not sure how to proceed.
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" because the President's response to the impeachment was delayed and the prospect of "heavy" increased.
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is seen to be raised daily, and some close associates of the president are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable actions and concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means are spurred by concerns about Presidents and politics in the environment of election years.
Trump faced the greatest threat ever before in his term of office, and revived his strategy during the Russian investigation by Robert Moller, which he considered effective.
Trump attempted to lighten the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of political enemies, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and also attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for partisan conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the Mora investigation, but this time they began to feel the difference.
The President, whose power is branded, seemed to be coming at a press conference on Wednesday, said a detailed person in this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information on calls with President Trump, Vladimir Zellensky, and Ukrainian presidents, who have been controversial, argue that it is a fact that undermines the credibility of whistleblowers and are confident that damage can be reduced.
Furthermore, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, Republican strategic families close to the White House point out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and the effect of impeaching new supporters will not be much.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to focus on the impeachment of the president four months ahead."
Another source of information stated that those who claim impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how uncertain the president's response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the plan, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as strategic decision rooms will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations activities in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum of the publication and publication of organizational legal strategies and communication strategies and critical internal accusations to the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munshin, who stated that they would not publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president after 48 hours.
The current pressure is expected to increase from the time of Robert Morler's investigation, who only spoke through the indictment, according to the person involved in the case, who could be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump and Corrie Luwandouski, who served as the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we haven't talked to the president or close adviser about participating in a team that counteracts this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left Pat Sipolon, the current White House legal adviser, with little experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
For more information on the White House strategy, he said, in general, that the parties are far from recruiting human resources and building strategic teams, but aware that they need human resources to be organized and able to lead all their efforts to respond and political struggle.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request.
Senator Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems to be unable to bear the idea of President Donald Trump being investigated.
Thursday, in a comment to defend the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive at the House Information Special Committee, filed in a statement at the beginning of the hearing about the internal accusations Trump had asked for a Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son to investigate.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democratic Party of this special committee negotiated with Ukrainians to obtain Trump's nude photos."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes ended, HuffPost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democratic Party was trying to find the truth.
Only Congressman Jim Heims of the Connecticut Democratic Party responded so far, but many other members questioned whether the answer was a red-naked truth.
Mediate Dotcom speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more details of unidentified details" that are said to have been written in steel documents that are controversial.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected by Trump in a hotel room in Moscow looking at the release of prostitutes.
Origami, wallet and real card.
Money transfer, financing, insurance and investment - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to send money (moving) in addition to payments made by Origami Pay.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the problems of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origami ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get timely information.
He also explained that by deploying not only the Origami app but also on partner companies' apps, it would be possible to use the Origami app even if it did not.
In terms of financing, we introduce functions that can be used to pay back payments in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were needed suddenly, the Origami app was completed from application to repayment.
In terms of insurance, as a partner company, he introduced Aioi Nisei Insurance and First Life.
The two companies said they plan to use their data and knowledge to develop insurance products in line with life events.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually after registration to the necessary administrative bodies.
New businesses for effective use of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support effective use of data, including data held by companies, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its payment function.
In partner companies that partner with Origami, such as payment and settlement functions, Origami recognizes that effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge, such as obtaining structured data such as sales and unstructured data in real society, and accumulating, processing and analyzing such data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data along with payment data by its Pay and structured data owned by its affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models utilizing digital technology and data.
Mr. Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies gather various data and make customer contact," and explained, "In the next phase, how to use data to develop business models is key."
"We want to create innovation in the next phase by combining data built on the Origami Network and data from many companies."
Details of specific services will be announced sequentially.
In addition, the Origami Conference 2019 will provide the convenience of Origami's future efforts, such as sending coupons to smartphones after rain.

renewable biofuel research can reduce emissions
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only airplane to fly in the air and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid waste such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and Canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil fats to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude oil-based fuels, and other industrial wastes can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems in aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is something like a dilemma," Bresler said.
There is no value as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as biofuel for jets.
The first is a low-risk approach that requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that are already partially developed to maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try the reactor to change the chemical reaction a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Fortune Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon tax on them."
I want to prepare an alternative to the worst case.
Currently, Fog operates a test plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center, and recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin to help build 2500 million production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel per year.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but there is no reduction in fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bressler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple choices can be made in parallel with the decisions given.

Boris Johnson warned that Britain would face riots like Los Angeles if Brexit was overturned.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a danger that "the violent riots by the people" would occur in this country.
The Prime Minister's officials warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that he "nearing needs to be reduced" to political words exchanged with intense rhetoric, but insisted that he would not use the term "default."
Despite the fact that the prime minister appealed to the Times to regain his calmness, one minister said: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gile Joan or the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best exercise - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and then there's a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to a verdict of innocence.
This year, the French anti-government demonstration participant Gire Joan, who wore the eye-catching yellow vest, has caused confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, the 10 million people would be discontented."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first result, there would be a risk of a "strong riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson calls for the general election to leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing the House Rebellion, seeking to lower the demands for EU withdrawal and instead to hit the EU with a compromise.

Pakistani social media celebrity brother, a life sentence for honor murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the incident fades.
"It's time-consuming, so people forget," said Farzana Bali, the first female rights activist at the University of Gender Studies in Pakistan, who added that even the Burrought incident, which attracted attention, took more than three years to solve.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "principal murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the actual number of honorable murders is much more than that, because it is estimated that approximately one fifth of the 5,000 honorable homicides occurring worldwide each year are occupied by Pakistan.

flood and chaos caused by prolonged monsoons in many areas
India's monsoon season is about a month long, unprecedented rainfall causes buildings to collapse and death, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month has increased by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, the monsoon will weaken during the most late decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, in western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays resulted in the collapse of the building and the disaster.
The houses were flooded, and the residents were watered to their knees and crossed the street, usually seen only at the peak of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Laknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains have caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
For farmers, prolonged monsoons are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mecherer, a small farmer in Vimtar, Uttarakand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables will rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pens) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival will be in Dashera on October 8th, with the Hindus setting up Ravana, the evil smiling figure of a beard that appears in the giant comic book-style doll, epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, it may be Lavana to laugh at the end.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides could increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
The latest research shows that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the research.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women and other races because it is targeted only by Japanese Americans.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," said Dr. Rodriguez.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to aging, which hides possible relationships between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko intervention at the conference of Zerensky Trump telephone
The impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump were taken, and the Washington political issue was a dramatic week.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners Vologzimir Zellensky.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump telephone problem so far, and is there a widespread impact on Zellensky?
At the beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the U.S. had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's objection of 100% rather than 1000 percent is controversial.
Zellensky added that President Macron and Merkel both did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties, argued on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poloshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for support received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he thanked the EU for its support including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Voyticica, said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then hinted at military aid and asked Zellensky to investigate two rather than one, the first of which is against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is the investigation of the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is uncertain whether this would hinder European relations or lay backwater against French and German leaders.
I don't want to talk about anyone.
Thanks to the announcement of the call record, I would like to thank the people who helped me."
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards for international civil aviation.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded by Ghana to provisionally acquire the effective implementation rate of 89.89%, and to be awarded the highest score in Africa by air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019, following the United Nations Air Force's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was recognized by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding safety at airports and their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of ICAO's support for the country's zero campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for safety evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Minister of Aviation Joseph Kofi Ada Ghana, Director of Civil Aviation Simon Alloti Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aiko Otou to Canada, and Director of Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
The chairman of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICA) Council, Olmiwa Benad Aliu, stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to keep in mind that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada said that the award was a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's efforts and patience.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy as "airs are likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but they all have the safety and security we have achieved.

Trump appoints Peter Gayno as FEMA Chief: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Secretary of State for Emergency Management Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Senate Committee at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Secretary of FEMA, was in the position of deputy director to oversee government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been absent since March, when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, determined that Mr. Long had illegally used government-owned cars to commute between Washington and his home Norcarorina, and resigned.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, brought up doubts that he was drunk in alcohol and involved in the riots, and was excluded from the selection at the beginning of this month after consideration.
Mr. Gayno's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Bureau in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of Butanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found at an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found equipment packed with beep cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," said Captain Kano.
Captain Cano said that he had previously been engaged in drug investigations, and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used for Bayp products.
"Only static electricity from clothes can fire, and because it is concentrated, it will cause not only fires but explosions," said Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions and fires.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigator said that he received some anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant on the site that discovered illegal activities.
The investigators are still pursuing who is the black curtain of illegal Beip activities.
Police said that the office was empty, so Zhang himself believed that the office had a store.
As the investigation continues, police said they would like to receive recent news, especially about the dangers of bating, to tend to illegal babyping products and not go out again.
"I don't know whether it's real or what I'm buying."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.

The lost dress of Elizabeth I, exhibited at Hampton Court Palace
It was woven with silver foil yarn, made of the finest camlet silk, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, animals and butterflies was fluffy.
The dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, Ellie Lynn, determined that it was one point.
Lin saw this fading piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in one countryside, which was placed there 100 years ago, and is considered part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this luxurious cloth, which was used as the altarpiece of the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly the room where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one other dress left in the 16th century was found in the entire Royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence for Elizabeth's dress through the sleeves, three years of research raised the conviction of experts that the dress was not part of the royal possession.
The "silver silk cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but it also suggests that the embroidery of plants and flowers of the "principles" quality also suggests that the patterns of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen, bears, and earlier owners were noble.
The dress seems to have been a price equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions when it was built.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen would be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or would not tolerate rivalries wearing such luxury clothing.
Mr. Lin said it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues.
I was always happy to hear that the cloth was amazing, and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one piece of dress used as an altarpiece of the St. Face Church in Baxton, cut off and blind, seems unexpected but not so.
Baxton is a village from Blanch Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, according to local legend, that cloth has long been associated with Parry.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
Over 1000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and fine surgical needles, a very delicate hand-sewing altar cloth will be exhibited next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and led by Libby Thompson said, "If you're dealing with historic fabrics, you'll feel really respectable to the artisans who made it."
When you look at the embroidered embroidery on the front and back, you will be very respectful to those who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched" A week after the missing female child, the Self-Defense Force withdrew The volunteer male is missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
This is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at a campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces (SDF) closed the search and withdrew on 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk such as mountain slopes and Sawa.
On the 27th, a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search disappeared, and the search was not found.
The police and fire department will continue to search from 6:30 am on 29th.
The first oral speech by Miyazaki - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation, as compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member is the lowest in the country in July this year, with only 0.71 votes in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 votes in Kagoshima Prefecture.
In the first oral speech held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and constitutional.
On the other hand, the Defendant's prefectural election management committee called for a rejection of the bill, saying, "It is not a matter of significant inequality, but should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

An unmanned supply vehicle arrives at the space station Catch with a Robot Arm | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
No. 8 Konotori, an unmanned supply vehicle that arrived at the International Space Station.
The robot arm of the station is growing from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) succeeded in catching Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th.
On the night of 28th, the unmanned spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA) carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), which is about 400 kilometers altitude, arrived near the station, while the astronauts during their stay operated the robot arm.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced under control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, the speed difference is eliminated and the distance is about 10 meters.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters long is a flow that grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching to the station, the flight attendants carry the cargo.
Mexican drug cartel executive, one third of the american drug
Chicago Out Immediately after the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in daylight.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose.
McNight said that 90% of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named Nemecio Servantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Mexican agent Matthew Donahew DEA said, "Mencho is DEA and, in fact, the top-prior of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
The prize money raised by El Mencho reached $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug production sites in the dense forests of El Mencho were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva, is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "massive" cocaine, methane phetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's head received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special maneuvers.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho dies without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders have occurred due to drug cartels fighting.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the solder.
More than one third of the drug was produced by El Mencho.
Donahew said that Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively deprive the lives of innocent women and children.
In other words, when someone died, Donahew said that it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the past
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of its sequel, Last of As, February 2020.
Some of the video games of this new action game were showcased by fans.
More details have been announced a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in many ways.
Since the PSwan era, the Last of As Part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous work, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to tell the story that there were so many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how much this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game was very large and did not enter a single Blu-ray.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it is not possible to ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic Notic Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 limited to PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently released the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
If Last of As Remastered likes and wants to pre-order the sequel, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replica, a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "help" Council Trials Residents wish to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th day of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, mobile sales began by the Notoshima Regional Development Council.
During the trial until December, wagons with daily necessities, seasonings, and food crossed the Suso-chokai and Hanpo-chokai on the first day.
Some of the products were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents were asked to continue saying, "I'm happy to pick the goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiro gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Suso Town Council, residents were able to gather, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the Council expressed his surprise that "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I don't know when my father can drive, and I hope he will continue."
Users also received orders such as "I don't want a can coffee, but I want coffee to be dripped by myself."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to save "shopping weak."
From December to December, we will consider whether the 20-machi-kai in the island will be held once a month and whether it will continue as a business after next year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he decided to provide additional $100 million to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by droughts have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been significantly reviewed for simplicity.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be allocated to the drought-affected community support organization and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will be provided with a maximum of $100 million of drought relief funds for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted over $70 billion for drought relief.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of his five children.
The authorities said on July 9, 2014 that Haskell was pushed into the house of Stay and asked her where she was staying.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old son, 9 and 7 years old daughter died.
Only one person in his family, Kashdi Stay, who was 15 years old at the time, died.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed the innocence of Ronald Lee Haskell's heart loss.
The jury was dismissed from prison until Monday.
"If you choose to disappoint us, never forgive us."
I wonder if the girl's appeal was echoed by the local leaders.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread school strikes around the world.
Young people, who raised anxiety and frustration, protested all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people from over 150 countries participated.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is approaching close.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century, and to reduce the temperature rise from before the industrial revolution by less than two degrees.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is often pointed out to be associated with global warming.
One step of efforts is required to strengthen global warming at a fast pace.
At the summit held by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal of virtually zero by 50 years.
Other 70 countries raised their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission power has become apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's efforts at environmental-related meetings, said at a conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal does not deny, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wounds that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "replacement of issues" that the individual counters.
There is no longer a grace to combat global warming, and the international community must respond to the common crises of humanity.
We can't see the effectiveness of each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act without taking away the future.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The U.S. Army's research results led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such internet may provide military safety, measurement and time-keeping capabilities that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute Distributed Quantum Information Center, which is funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between matter and light - 50 km away using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and measured in one, even if the other quantum bits are physically far from the other, the measurement results are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who announced the results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network is composed of a network of physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale distributed entangling," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum network use.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured in ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions and excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with fiber optic cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed into fiber optic cables," says Lañon.
The team first sent the light particles through non-linear crystals with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, the optimal value for long-distance transfer - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a fiber optic cable 50 kilometers long.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance movement of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, leading to the realization of an entangled network of long-range atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army from the perspective of accurate positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications," said Dr. Frederick Fatemi, an Army researcher who co-operated this program.
