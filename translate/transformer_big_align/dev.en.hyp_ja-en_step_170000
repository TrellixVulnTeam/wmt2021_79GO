Croatia is planning nuclear treatment facilities, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the town of northwestern Bosnia and protested the next Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in the town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon plans to store the remains of the barracks in Trugovska Gola, and vow to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future" and "We need a hard stop" said that nuclear waste disposal facilities could threaten the lives of about 250,000 residents in the Una and surrounding areas.
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grad, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and rivers.
The Kursko nuclear power plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or whether Slovenia should pay for the amount of waste processed in newly constructed facilities.
Tomislav Chorich, Minister of Environment and Energy of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would Bosnian pants pocket, that is, the Turkovska gola, be the best place in Croatia?"

There are various types of pathological conditions, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is false that they are also ill.
However, the representative Münchhausen syndrome is clearly false that others under their protection are ill.
It is also known as FII, a type of child abuse.

So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
Although signs of pathology vary in case-by-case, NHS points out the following points as a precaution.
The child is healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to convince the medical practitioner.

The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as adding glucose to the urine sample to show that they are diabetes.
Overdose medications and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How general is Münchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.

Nigeria: police force the school of caduna, rescue 300 children
Caduna - The State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
Police said that children were placed in a humanitarian environment, but the school denied this claim.
The school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
Parents came to deliver their children's meals every day, so they knew what the environment was.
It was very surprising that the police came and evacuated the children, and that the parents had all the food they had delivered, so they closed the school.
There are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair treatment."
He adds that Abdullahman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see how the children were in the environment, but never complained.
The children are also told that they can learn Koran and that it is all.
However, police chief Yakub Savo said that children would be reunited after being handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Corlan, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Central Coast's "Super Evil Nonway" camouflage girl raped, and court orders against the victims.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending a school in Central Coast, Kentucky.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to trees and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges, including this assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on the road and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and knife suddenly coming out of the bushes.
When the girl asks, "Don't, stop, stop."
The man said to the girl, "Don't speak loud.
When I hear it, I'm going to have to face it."
The man had a knife on his right hand, tied the girl's hands with a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused for nearly an hour.
When a man broke the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., although he had several phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood on the clothes of mud, grass, and trees, and was involved in street violence, and claimed that he had been chasing the driver to the bush, and that he had fallen by hand.
The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development, based on public interests, warned IT representatives
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats and investors on Friday that if there was no ethical assessment of public interest, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
At the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference proved to be the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions on the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work were held, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand, and responses by social media companies during atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the meeting, the Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances are causing increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will be counterproductive to a kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to use the expertise of the participants in this meeting to find the human resources who can become future advisers of the Catholic Church on the high-tech field.
Nagano Appliance Directed by G Abe!
thank you.
Hiroshima and Nagano Kuyoshinote (34) started their career in the mid-day battle (Mazda) on the 27th.
The first two-and-a-half hit was "September" by Earth Wind & Fire on the appearance of giant Abe who announced his retirement this season.
The result was a liner-liner medium flight, but a sensitive fan who noticed Nagano's stylish surprise was applauded.
For Nagano, Abe became a senior official after becoming a professional.
At the Tokyo Dome, the giant DeNA, who played a memorial game for Abe's retirement, gave a message to his master.
Real Madrid's loan, players Martin Woodegor, and cheerleading fans.
Martin Woodegor was surprised by Michel Oyalusabar's preemptive support.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, breaking the record in the domestic season, and winning the top of the La Liga rankings.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the unconvinced defeat of Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Arabes, was surprised by Michel Oyalusabar's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite pass through the inside of the other two players to Oyalusabal to determine the goal by taking this exact slew ball.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third penalty spot of the stunning Oyalusabar, he secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before Alabeth's midfiller, Manu Garcia, withdrew in 5 minutes.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015 but struggled to demonstrate his reputation.
This young Norwegian, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated his territory.
Anna Hazale, the name of Sharad Powerl was surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When we contacted this lawsuit, the name of Sharad Powerle was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the name of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerl in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Bureau (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew, former Deputy Minister of State Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the Central Authority.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Amit Powerle and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit was reached, the name of Sharad Power was nowhere.
The executive's lawsuits and suspicions that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud were questioned, and Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "only they know how Sharad's name appeared or who mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name appeared in this incident."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the October 21 elections in Maharashtra.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
The NCP referred to the action by the Executive Bureau as a political summary.
South Africa: A 20-year-old man was arrested for the murder of a student from the UKZN, Cinesenba d'Rob.

According to Colonel Tembeka Mubare, a 20-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday.
The police said in this week that he was stabbed under the left side and abdomen.
She is said to have been a guest at Musinga Drifkarna Motorsports event on Saturday evening.
In a statement issued on that day, the organizers of the motor sports event stated in a preliminary report that it was likely that the customer factor remained after the event work to watch the music performance.
Unfortunately, one of them was attacked by strangers on the way, and then died in a hospital.

we agreed to pay 30 million dollars for epipen settlement
The company agreed to pay a settlement of $30 million in cases where investors did not disclose information on the investigation of the U.S. Department of Justice on the presence of over claims over epipenes on Medicaid.
On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had classified epipen as "Generic" in the Medicaid drug rebate program.
This shows that payments from pharmaceutical companies to governments were extremely low compared to those classified as "brand" drugs.
The company announced in July that it had reached a fundamental agreement with the SEC regarding the matter.
The company statement issued on Friday did not affirm or deny SEC claims.
Stop the mistake of stepping the accelerator pedal!
Four Preliminary Supplies - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by mistake.
In particular, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistake by elderly drivers is on an increasing trend.
In particular, when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes a panic, and sometimes the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
A new car equipped with a safety driver support function to cover such a driver error is introduced, but there are also rearing equipment that can be attached to an unattended car.
After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling sudden start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and at the same time it passes.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] The "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot informs you of pedal mistakes from a new perspective.
It is to avoid the pedal mistake with a " alarm sound."
The mechanism generates a " alarm sound" when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake with the brake when stopping or driving slow.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping, it avoids rapid acceleration.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are prone to hearing.
The device is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and the affordable price is also attractive.
[Ashimo Watching kun] The World Wing launched its launch in mid-September with the Ashimo Watching kun, an accelerator and brake step prevention device.
It is also compatible with back time without moving forward.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is suddenly trampled, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the rapid advance.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantly control the sudden start by turning it into a creep running state (the brake is removed in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of about 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to be cleaned up.
The mounting is only possible with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Ms. Suosato Kusumoto (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that a three-year-old child who liked the nursery school suddenly stopped going to the nursery school after a flood and was forced to stay at night.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up their homes and didn't have time to face enough," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can't panic and say "OK" to children."
Yukari Okushi (36) in Shiraishi-cho spent a night at a shelter town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
"If there is a child who can't stay still, I feel around him."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend my time at home as much as possible in the event of a disaster with food and simple toilets.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinako Kawazaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a child of 6 and 8 years old, proposed that " elementary school had an e-mail on the day before, but there was no communication network or email system for nursery schools.
There were also requests to build systems that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I don't know what it was like last time."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
President Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandals of the Mayor of London in violation of criminal law.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that the GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts on acts" on suspicion that Mr. Curi had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"Actual matters exist if there is information indicating that crimes could have been done," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations issued by police in England and Wales.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the police chief at the time.
Johnson denied cheating related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, although he claimed it was "contrary."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported that U.S. citizens who moved to London seven years ago had received preferential treatment for Johnson from public money to £126,000 during the Mayor's era, and Johnson and others to participate in three foreign trade delegations.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 to the hacker house, the company of Mr. Curi during the investigation.
The company will be asked questions about the investigation process taken before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns the British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arcuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among employees."
The move of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say that this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the previous night of the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The director did not submit any evidence for any charges, and the Prime Minister was not given the opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority prior to the press announcement issued late on Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will be able to see the political Kyogen that was created by amasama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the friendship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Tourism and Regional Promotion Division was "public secret."
The former staff of London & Partners (L&P) said that despite some people who considered the company "unreliable" at that time, they had the privilege of attending trade-related talks abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
The 20th Anniversary of the Sunflower Fund - Yahoo!
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Sawakami Susumnobu, about the future prospects.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the people involved, not the history that was played by the power of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of supporting the formation of property of ordinary people.
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public is eliminated from the anxiety of money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operation will not be performed unless you walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have been talking about since the day, "We will support companies that are needed in the world."
The result is a 20-year long-term long-term fund and we believe it is because we continue to be a direct sales system that delivers messages directly to many people.
In the report at the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl before Miller accidentally overtakes cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl and died last September, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petitt had obtained drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested early this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petitt as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against individual cases.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for the 2005 drug case, and he was sentenced to five months in prison in violation of his compliance.
The prosecutors in charge of the case, first reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the trial began due to the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to the phone call message to the lawyer.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics include a frank word about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke out in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram and published a song about Miller, "Sancue Next."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died related to opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died of overdose of drugs in 2016 and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, the spelling of Walter's name was corrected by Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch2 to create a hidden game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, animations and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch a bat from a hiding place.
He learned how to play in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN that "we're spending time building games when we're bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil an opportunity to experience new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing with many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, he became interested in Basil's game production.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," his father said.
He said, "I'm always playing games, but how about making games myself so that others can play?
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil care about it."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil, who wants to become a scientist in the future, gives his name to his game.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it comes to African innovation, the younger generation like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds have been awarded a robot that uses program code to divide housework.
In May 2019, the women's high school team of Ghana, Akrobot, who programmed boxed robots, won the Robofest Contest.
Google and Microsoft's huge technology companies are investing in Africa, and Basil and the children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
the former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and a false testimony to the bribery investigation.
According to court documents submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely accused federal agents of investigating corruption related to major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' attorney, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Haze recognizes.
Hayes was initially accused of conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
Prosecution officials accused Hayes of being involved in the insurance company's plan to fund the state's insurance director's election in return for special treatment.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cozy.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindbergh supported Republican ideas and politicians, but also offered to the Democrats.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked him to comment on Friday and email, but he did not reply.
On Friday, Hannes Davis, the defendant's attorney at Hayes, also requested an additional comment by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken with Cozy about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to the facts, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cozy, and that he spoke directly with the supervisor.
The indictment, published in April, claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to raise $2 million to campaign for Cozy's 2020 re-election.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no suspicion.
Indicted in a conversation, including Lindbergh and Cozy, it is described that Lindbergh's co-owner instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cozy's re-election campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would draw attention if he had moved so much money, but was eventually broken in the conversation.
In an indictment, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an email asking for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, the goal of improving the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like to post others!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and only posted.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager, Mia Garrick, said that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who consider the number of happy surveys and goodies to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garlic said, "We had a very positive feedback from a number of coordinated bullying groups and mental health groups."
It is only to delete numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchanges rather than the number of nices and reactions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
It is very early to test in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, and other countries.
Instagram, a Facebook affiliate, has not announced when the test will end or will remain unchanged.
"There were initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, who is in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very active Facebook and Instagram user.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my mother's favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was Cando's handcrafted parts that helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying, don't sell anymore.
Her mother's broken bag, the jaw is the ultimate Petit Pla goods.
Therefore, if you ask the shop for repairs, the price of the main body was significantly higher.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this connected fitting.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was moved when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It is originally a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
It was planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you put it on one side of the bag, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is a smooth installation.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, movement is poor ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The amount of metal fittings has increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight has no problem at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, an express train of the National Railways, takes a 10-hour trip to Hiroshima - Kumamoto | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
To wait for the departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era
A temporary train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station and left Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo between 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, a tour was organized.
The train is a seven-car train consisting of carriages and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo Line, Chikuto Line, and Kagoshima Line.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother's life imprisonment with the honor murder of the social media star in pakistan.
The famous photo posted on social media was strangled in July 2016.
His older brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of her sister's murder on Friday, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the most attention of his father-in-law, Pakistan.
Baloti, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
His brother said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memoud, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
The lawyer said, "Inshirar, the thought of God, will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that he wanted his son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Barochi's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of the lightening of the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "honorary murders."
In the case of Mr. Barochi, a woman chooses a marriage partner by herself, she burns, kills, stabs or strangles her family with crimes such as praise of her sexuality.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow perpetrators to be pardoned from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honor killing.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can theoretically claim another motive and may be forgiven.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted not give him forgiveness.
However, the sad parents, thinking about losing their son, changed their thoughts and told them to forgive their son.
In response to international hate for killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented means of declaring the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a bright red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although it became critical and threatening, it was recognized by many, including young people, that it opened up new heavens and earth in a country where expression of oneself as a presence like Kim Kardashian is considered a bold and political activity to improve women's status.
The origins of the "priority" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, especially in women's behavior, although men may be victims.

In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Shigeki has been thinking twice about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article) Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko adheres to the traditional "man's fantasy" and the pattern learning for mote is overwhelming!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool man.
if you're bound by what you're supposed to do
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and behavior of people.
When learning patterns, I think that in this case, the brain systemizes behavior so that I can live in a lax.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I'm "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you're stuck with the old pattern of "the university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say, "What should I do?" or "What should I do?"
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I've talked about that in my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by allowing people around him.
He doesn't want to be light.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by the "thinkness" you cannot be light.
As far as I have heard from all kinds of women, regardless of position or age, it seems to be a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to know what this "cute" is.

In the northwestern part of Nigeria, illegally doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 in the last four months due to intensified violence.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, a new humanitarian crisis was created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year a new $35.5 million fund-raising activity will be needed.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that the Islamic extremist Boko Haram, who has been active in anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, over the last ten months, violent acts in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina were organized by armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok said on Friday to the press.
Abducts, tortures, assaults, murders and sexual violence have occurred frequently, and the raiders have destroyed houses and are working on theft, the press said.
Military and police are also sent to fight criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Boko Haram and the West African branch of Islamic State, which was split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," Barrok says.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees passed to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR stated in a statement that the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger were expected to increase in the coming months.

The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system where multiple bids (advertisers) and fair bid competition can prioritize high-priced ads to media operated by media companies.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
In the past, SSP has been providing advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP started in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, directly buying advertising frames that accompany advertisers' requests.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header bindings allow them to participate in bidding directly to the header binding target advertising frame, which is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, because the target media companies are limited, the advertising frame of each destination along with the brand image is secured, preventing damage to brand value.
The advantages of media companies are that the solution to manage the code of each Vidder company, called the "Lapper Solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, enables initiatives that meet the expectations of introducing media companies.

Two months of suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that a male assistant professor at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the General Affairs Department, Assistant Professors of the University of Tokyo, from around October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, they became emotional and abused in inappropriate words.
He was a teacher of education and was recognized as having worsened the learning environment.
A survey conducted in September 18 reported several students.
The management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and from December of the same year, they conducted an investigation at the Harassment Prevention Committee by teachers at Yonezawa Campus.
Based on the findings from the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
As an assistant professor, he continued his education after the survey, but his actions were improved through interviews and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama said, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to make every effort to prevent harassment and restore trust."
The University also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students taught by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts Boris Johnson demands a compromise with the EU, reducing the demands of withdrawal from the EU.
Now that only three weeks have passed since the EU summit meeting, there has been growing concerns around the Prime Minister that the prime minister might be out of time to withdraw significant concessions.
Boris Johnson faces a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of withdrawal from the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are tight, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will propose a compromise proposal, including a three-year time limit on the backstop, to the Conservative Party leader.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the senior advisor Dominique Camings, and insist that the EU accepts the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One cabinet member said that the ruling that the Supreme Court's closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday would be "a bell," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House of Representatives, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his steps.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and the Camings project is clearly unsuccessful.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to implement the previous Prime Minister's proposal, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many that everyone is trying to end this.
If we do not postpone, Boris will end and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer condemned Boris not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a harsh speech, said: "The Prime Minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Whales, and discussing with the people in the streets.
The Prime Minister's spokesman admitted yesterday that the agreement was still a long way ahead, and said, "If anyone does not think of it, the journey is still long."
However, the press also said that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month postponement if it does not agree, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to keep moving forward despite the passage of the bill."
Steven Berkeley, Minister of Delegation of the European Union, returns to Brussels today to discuss further with Michel Barnier of the EU.
They discuss how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, revealed that he was told by the TV station boss that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, "It was so tense," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV and ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorraine.
In celebration of her 35th anniversary, she broadcast a special show about Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
He added that passion and enthusiasm and curiosity were the key to survival in the television industry, and that the moderator said, "You have to put it into work."
To be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting incident was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't even think that many of the families of the children who were killed or injured were watching us broadcast the show live from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, who was killed by her mother and five-year-old daughter Joanna, personally told me to meet me, so we talked for hours at her house.
I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and that "we really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
i was afraid of the trap.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Tiwenga declined the offer of presidentship from the late President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to anxiety that it might be a trap to follow military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give Presidentship as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Tiwenga refused the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders of all over the world and the African Union that he was stripped of the regime in a coup, rather than anxiety, and government officials reported on social media.
According to Jamwanda2's Twitter account, officials confirmed that he was a senior official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has held the administration for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munngawa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, tried to contact Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three.
President Spokesman George Charanba, and high officials said that Aaron Nepera, the top representative of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, and Fidelis Muconoli, the Roman Catholic bishop, were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to condemn the African Union's military actions while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to give the presidency to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of the former president.
"It was a wasteful action to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerous and rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there was a little political aim of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If something destroys the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I would like you to remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and not break it.
The late President (Mugabe) hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and destroy the claims of the commanders claiming that he did not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, who had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, would decide whether to position it as a coup, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe was forced to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that they would not turn guns to the citizens, even if they had invaded the presidential house called the Blue Roof.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders at that time read the intent accurately.
A strong metaphorical expression was used in the words of an envoy (gono) telling the president's desperate message: "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa (which we belong to the Kamofuruge group or the military department) and we are not politicians or political competitors."
The Army told the other commanders of the region that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at the time, South Africans who were key to this process refused to intervene, but were repeatedly threatened behind it, making it clear that the South African army would immediately be sent to Harare if the military invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources tell the Independent.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to the ban on nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
[Joint New York] On the 26th at the UN Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and Ms. Michiko Takeuchi (63) of the second generation of atomic bombings, a granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, delivered a speech and appealed for support for the treaty.
Five new countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, including 32 countries and regions.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were made in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, set by the United Nations.
Secretary General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern over recent years that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is no other way to abolish it."
China needs strong leadership.
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In a white paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party since its administration 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the Party.
China is vast, and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified strong leadership, China will lead to division and collapse, and will be a disaster for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the repression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989, as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he held the government in late 2012.
Mr. Xi also oversaw military modernization programs that threatened the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development models, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but merely seek peace.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no aggression or world control.
In modern times, China was bullied by the bullies, and war and chaos left a deep scar with the pain; China would never give the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficulties such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in China's Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "delete" nuclear profits and will not allow the loss of security and sovereignty.
"The threat of trade war and the rising tariffs do not lead to any problem-solving," White Paper states.
China is a mature economic nation with the momentum of complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development.
"It never weakens in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China has the power to face difficulties, turn crisis into opportunities, and open a new world.
Since China has no idea of combating the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., the U.S. should consider China's development calmly.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more likely to stop China's development.
The U.S. would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko.
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masashi Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as a coach and the director (responsibilities teacher) will be determined promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that local newspapers had a rumor about baseball club members.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's neck and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the questionnaire survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again.
In the summer of 2015, Motochika WATANABE (74), who was raised by Daisuke MATSUSAKA and others, left the city.
He served as Director of the Board of Directors and Director of the Board of Directors.
From summer 16 to summer, he participated in the Koshien Garden in the summer for three consecutive years.
However, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals this summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in autumn, and the Senbatsu tournament in next spring was desperate.
The Spice Girls' MerC, the Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage Severage, and the Diet's topic at home is prohibited.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, from his experience of eating nothing but fruit and vegetables for many years, admitted that diets were banned at home.
Sporty spices have been "excessive exercise" for many years under pressure from members of the global pop group, and have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by the child rearing of his daughter Scarlett, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, a "bad" comment on himself in the press led to physical problems, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, became more and more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted for almost a few years."
Judiciary judgment of same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's decision was made to acknowledge the fact that "marriage (internal marriage) " in accordance with marriage was a matter of dispute.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, and there is a system in which local governments such as Sapporo City authenticate the same-sex partnership in Japan.
The decision was based on the fact that two women were married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to recognize legal protection for same-sex couples.
The same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Register Law, but a lawsuit is filed in five district courts, including Sapporo.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system of recognizing diverse families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years, and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The court ruled that "the reality of marriage between men and women is not the same" due to the achievements of the two living together.
It is a revolutionary decision to extend the recognition of married couples with the right to marry in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of which marriage is based only on the agreement of both sexes.
Both sexes were "unprecedented at the time of establishment because they were not supposed to be same-sex marriages, so they were not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
"The Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," and it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, the problem remained that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women."
While recognizing the same situation as between men and women, it may be difficult to distinguish the right to protect.
The public's awareness has also changed, as 70% of married women are required to recognize same-sex marriage by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a spouse who accepts the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as having no preferential treatment in tax terms and having no joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only the same-sex marriage but also the expansion of legal rights for actual marriage.
Trials and jury trials of former athletes prosecuted for rape against multiple women
A jury trial was held for former Delaware University baseball players who were accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and speech, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
The 21-year-old woman stated that she had been sexually assaulted after sending her to her home by car.
The two met after three weeks at the meeting site Bumble, and Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women's contradictions and differences in memory may have regretted having physical relations.

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, obviously in video
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, curer keys, Luna Park and some famous harbor bridges.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow through the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around the most popular cities in Australia are filled with shells, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing through the road surface into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor to clog the waterway.
Dr. Katherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most polluted estuaries of Japan.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but Sydney Harbour was pretty tragic," Dr. Duffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what the truth is there," said Richard Nichols, owner, Dave Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is underneath the water surface), I think everyone will be really excited.
Although overwhelming, more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
Plastics are used at least somewhere in the remaining half.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing down the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of Ocean Protect's founders and director, said that local residents and tourists can reduce plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a food source.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it's very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study of plastics and mental health was also presented this month, as part of a broader awareness of the environmental protection of Australian citizens and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between 12 and 18 have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
In the same study, the parents also ranked fourth in concerns about plastic waste, and 93 percent of 551 surveyed parents felt increasingly anxious about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
Former Karatsu Power Station was demolished in October | Saga News | Saga Shimbun
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which started demolition work in October, is Futatako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantlement was two used to discharge the gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
Each chimney is split from one tower crane and dismantled.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
There was a regrettable voice, and a man in his 60s who ran a restaurant nearby said, "When I saw a chimney coming back from afar, it was like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu."
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first was abolished in 89 and second in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because there is a nearby Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.
Product development with local fish Owashi Taka Fish nuggets and other sales Mie - Ise Shimbun
[Students promoting fishnaggets and Thai rice cooked in Otori High School in Furuno-cho, Owashi City]
[Owashi] Four third-year students from the prefectural Owashi High School Information Business Department in Furuno-cho, Owashi City, Mie Prefecture developed fish nuggets and Thai rice cooked using local fish.
It was sold at the school's cultural festival on June 26.
It is part of the Mie University satellite high-tech collaboration project to revitalize the water industry and forestry industries, which are local industries in the region.
The newly developed product is a fishnagget made from mutts that are caught in the Kumano Nada and rice cooked using aquaculture die from Owashi.
He said he was targeting young people.
Fishnaggets have developed three types of fishnaggets, including tofu, tofu, and gas shrimp from the tail eagle.
In cooperation with Kumano Fisheries Co., Ltd., he worked at a processing facility in Yugi-cho, Kumano City.
Thai rice mixed with shiitake and carrot.
"Oshio Ichibaoto" (Kodono-cho, Oshiwa City) is a seafood company based in Hayashi-cho, Owashi City.
Classes began in June.
They visited the Owashi factory and deepened their understanding of the water industry.
At the workshop, we discussed consumer needs and tried prototypes.
He also invented naggets using a hydrangea, but he adopted mutts because of the smell peculiar to fish.
Mr. Masaki Yamaguchi (17) said, "It's a product that can be eaten by people who are not good at fish, and I'm glad that many people can eat it."
It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell goods.
I am now (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Mayo Takahashi, a free announcer and monthly commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," spoke about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save me.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi seems to be like a master beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
It is different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was struck by being said to be "cone" or "bsaik," my father said, "If I thought it was "cone" but I didn't think it was "Mama came in with strength" and said, "I can't do it."
After that, when I joined the company in the second or third year, I was only working "Anyone with an empty girl Anna is good," and when I was not motivated by the work I wanted to do, even when my heart was rotten, "Who can do the job is hard to do."If so, "I asked everyone to do it," but I was glad to be in charge of Mama.
i learned naturally from my father's acting.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but since I joined the TV station, I've been in touch with news all the time with the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and I was happy that Mr. Matsuko Deluxe praised me as "good news reading of Mama."
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sense.
It has been cultivated through watching father's stage, film, television, and period dramas in childhood.
More importantly, I think that my father's work on variety shows and how to deal with them is thanks to various experiences of my childhood.
Experience the 300-year history of kumidori | Miyako Mainichi Shimbun Website - The latest news of Miyakojima is packed!
Workshops in Kagamihara
The workshop on the role and effect of five instruments played by kumidori was introduced.
A joint dance workshop (hosted by the Prefectural Board of Education Education Agency) was held at Kagamihara Junior High School on June 26.
All students attended the event and learned about the 300-year history and birth of the dance, as well as the acoustic effects and utilization of the instruments played.
At the workshop, members of the OB Group of the Ryukyu Performing Arts Department of the Prefectural University of Arts introduced the role of each instrument in group dance while playing three lines, koto, drums, kokyu and flutes.
The host, from Miyakojima City, served by Mr. Kawamata of the OB Association and introduced the charm of kumidori.
In this workshop, I learned how five kinds of instruments are expressed in dance by taking up "music" from three components of kumidori (music, chant, Ryukyu dance).
It was explained that the three lines were an element of the movement and emotional expression of the characters along with the songs, and that the kokyu was drawn up by playing the songs and the melody of the three lines.
In the latter half, students actually touched the instrument and experienced the sound of the instrument, and felt the charm of the instrument.
This initiative has been implemented with the aim of getting familiar with Ryukyu classical music through musical instruments and interested in many students about "gumi dance," and this is the first time in Miyako.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round was held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will revive in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which the FIA is governed by, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, the race has been held every year to become the world's highest rally championship with history and tradition, and it is said to be the toughest car racing championship because it is not only closed public roads (paved roads), but also gravel roads and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Invitation Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, the 2020 WRC Japan Round was decided at the World Motorsports Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Shoo Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.) and Mr. Shoo Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), both governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with relevant parties to ensure that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Japan as the center of motorsports representing Japan to appeal to the world a great deal."
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all."
Mr. Shoo Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very pleased to be able to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motorsports, commented on the Japanese round.
The WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Shirakucho) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ebisu City).
The main venue is the "Love / Earth Expo Memorial Park" opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exhibition.
In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is tasmaniadeville the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could bring great reform to patient treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells were camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurred in Tasmanian devil and humans.
This discovery is expected to create a new method for cancer treatment.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing deadly face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils on the verge of extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camfullage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
"The very important thing in this project is that we can reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy," said Mark Dawson, a researcher at Peter McClum.
Reuse traditional therapies, revitalizing markers, or proteins known as MHC, may allow the immune system to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is an epidemic in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where cancer cells escape detection.
"Unfortunately, there will be exactly the same process (to humans and Tasmanian devil cancer)," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
But if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, they may help control tumors."
scientists are puzzled
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-type planets orbit around a small star called red dwarf, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting the red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, who led this research published in Science, said.
The theoretical model shows that low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, such as Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only much smaller than our Sun, but also about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why it's red."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining the elliptic orbit of the Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gases and dust that create their own orbiting stars.
The most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, produces objects from solid particles in the disk, and the attraction of the eggs of the planet makes the surrounding gases into the atmosphere.
This unusual planetary system can be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star may be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature may have been lower."
Since the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant bean dip, ate to his colleagues and prosecuted.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating dipping beans with a stimulant to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of the transfer of methane fetamine and the use of regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit from OregonLive.com, a suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because Medina Hernández saw making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returns to work, her stomach gets worse and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, at a local hospital where a woman went, it was judged that soy dip could contain methane phetamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández "was told the victim's food that he had put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane fetamine in a bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows that Medina Hernández is leaning against the camera and leaning behind the microwave, but is taking something out of the brager.
It is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put the beans dip in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Stateman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was imprisoned in Marion County prison instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gunn, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of felony, robbery, sneezing, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required restructuring and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced their hospital name on September 26.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in the country, and three have already been integrated and transferred.
The names of hospitals in the prefecture announced were the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoshiki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Citizen Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital in Taramachi, Fujitsu County.
The city plans to build a new hospital in Higashi-Takyu-cho, Takyu-shi, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community-wide care in the town, and has been operating surplus in recent years.

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise frequent guests of the Royal Family aircraft
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use private machines that move royal families around the world for important events and appearances.
Of course, there is a privilege to have a private machine.
There is no limit to the number of baggage, and the Royal Family does not like it, and sometimes it seems that guests can be invited and put on, including unexpected passengers.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, only the Queen and Prince Philip are not frequent guests of royal aircraft.
During the "Royal Flight Secret" program, she revealed that the Queen's former flight attendants frequently ride with her family.
Bob Seals said, "Sometimes, like most important royal customers, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggy Dog Proficiency is famous, and it is not surprising to request a cute pet to travel together.
Queen Elizabeth loved dogs since she was a child, and it is said that she had more than 30 coggy dogs when she became a queen.
In 2007, he had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linet, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, five Cockerspaniel bist, oxo, flash, pick, and spans were added, as well as four mix dogs cider, Berry Balkan and Candy.
The staff on the Royal Aircraft will be busy.
The Royal staff were seen asking the dogs to leave the lawn before boarding, and Seals continued.
I've never been in an accident.
The show also found that the luggage during the Queen's official travel was known for a shocking amount.
According to the program narrator, "The Queen's luggage was 12 tons on a 44,000-mile British federal tour in 1953."
It is well understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
But the queen is not the only one who loves fashion.
The wife of the Marquis of Cambridge is said to have a unique taste when carrying her own clothes, and in Uwasa, she takes one seat per dress.

Trump Hotel owner's suitability also holds a liquor sale permit.
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Commission dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the local Trump International Hotel's license to sell liquor because of the question of the suitability of the owner.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three members, two former judges and two Jewish leaders that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to cancel the right to provide alcohol at the hotel is based on a state law that requires the applicant's "suitability" to obtain a liquor license.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year claimed that President Trump's assault and repeated fraud were violated by state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This is the second time a petition was issued to update the permit.

In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September of the same year.
The beekeepers, who were not inferior to the staff working at the crew factory, gathered more than 100 honey from just two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make beekeeping at the factory site where cars were assembled?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honeys produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive officer in the manufacturing department of Bentley, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers watched how honey bees are gathering from wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been working on a wide range of activities to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers through its Crew Plants and our business.
The staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the harvest amount of bentra honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to play our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million honeybees "Fly Bees" began.
And in September of the same year, after a summer, we completed the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box, and after the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator and filtered the fallen honey, it was bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like attention.
The label was designed by Louise McClum, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we want to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Fly Bees" honey such as scones.
it's the worst in the u.k.
A police officer named him the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
According to the Cleveland Police Department, "heavy deterioration" continues.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, efforts were made to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley, Director of the Police Department, said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Mike Wiel, head of the police station, resigned in January less than a year after his appointment, but was investigated for "deep" and several unpublished charges.
Deputy Director Adrian Roberts was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Committee on the Investigation of illegal acts for his colleagues to do sexual acts.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
It's time for the Interior Ministry to intervene."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal" and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what's going on.
At present, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate."
"We're going to do a job that we're starting to do based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Vladimir Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Giulani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security attorney in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before formal inquiries.
The Ministry of Justice, charged with inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of political financing violations.
In response to the question of whether Barr should testify, Pelosi said Friday that he would decide who the Special Intelligence Committee would call witnesses.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was "criminal."
Certainly, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's naming of the Attorney General for a telephone meeting with the President of Ukraine in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make decisions regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Pelosi said he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower who became the source of information when Trump attacked the whistleblower on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about those who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about the alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political profits and wrote a historic step.
The call was included in the accusations published on Thursdays, and the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office in the next 2020 presidential election to seek intervention in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-grade computer systems and replace them with special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace Forward Christian Bentek, speed violation prohibited driving
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.

Bentek, living in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek was convicted of these two violations under a single trial procedure, in which one magistrate tried and sentenced to light crimes.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the Review Committee
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) elections.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davies and expressed his dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA Sports, Mr. Manu said that the chairman was interested in the results of the examination process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from an outside party that has no relationship with each member before.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kuwak Parma about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if the Olympic Committee member Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club, but when Mr. Palmer attended the committee, he suggested that he had prejudice and unfairness.
The committee members were expected to start their activities from yesterday after the ceremony held at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19 and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Akpocavi, a sports director and lawyer.
A survey of the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture thought that "the minimum wage should be 1,000 yen."
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and 30% for non-regular employees.
Companies that answered "approved" to raise the hourly salary to 1,000 yen were often related to information (100 percent), construction (70 and 6 percent), and wholesale (61 and 7 percent).
The majority of respondents were manufacturers (51 and 9 percent) and service businesses (60 and 9 percent), including food, drink, and lodging.
The representative of the meeting said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high proportion of opposition in industries where part-time workers are often paid."
The average amount of money paid was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
After hearing the hiring status of the company in March 2007, the number of new graduates for regular employees was 61/3 percent, mid-term employment was 54-5 percent, and non-regular employment was 15-4 percent.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44 and 7 percent, 50 and 3 percent, and non-regulars remained 31 and 1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (37 and 5 percent of new graduates) and the construction industry (24, 1 percent of new graduates, 38 and 1 percent of junior colleges) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4 percent of the respondents said that they had problems in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, they pointed out that "the low number of applicants" "the low profile of the company" "the conditions favorable for wages cannot be presented."
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (residence within three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There were also opinions about encouraging students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% answered that the government has already approved the sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy.
Including 20 and 3% of the "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the overall acceptance posture was expressed.
The number of companies that "not admitted" was 64 and 4%, with construction (82, 8 percent), retail (73, 1 percent), and manufacturing (72, 7 percent).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) answered.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tipplick said that Wales will host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Walla Beads, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will probably be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory was the 14th win against Wales, Tiplic and his team would be a straight line between England and England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to win and finish at the top of the group."
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last autumn.
Australia thinks it's a lot of blame to return the loan, but it's time to try to win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I came here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one victory in the previous World Cup against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the total score for the Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight 3 team was only 7 wins in 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in a test match against Australia last November, but Tiplic was included in a number of representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiplic said: "It's hard to answer.
Certainly the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it would be impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
The key to Wales' victory is the break-down battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Law.
Up until now, Tiplic has played 67 international matches, and has been able to fight several matches or both players in the past, and knows what is waiting for.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you're going to face a tough game from now on.
They are always at the highest level in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in defensive combat, and Michael is an aggressive backs, but it may be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when needed.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself rather than confronting the very strong background.
If you want to fight with the best opponents and fight against them, you have to keep up with yourself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
the momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from performers?
A series of problems with Yoshimoto Kogyo, triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces, have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said in a press conference on July 22 that "the company does not have any talent in 9 or so," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the ratio of "9:1," the opinions of investors who were deemed to have received gifts from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and were taxed, were also posted on Twitter.
If Galla's share was "9:1," would there be a gift tax?
He was asked by Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax, regardless of whether or not the proportion of the Galler allocation is due.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax first.
If "9:1" is the amount of work for 1 million yen, the profit of 1 million yen in sales and 10 million yen in expenses will be 90 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you think about the allocation, you don't argue that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount I received is reported as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) away from the original market for tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as this time, no third party will decide on how much tax appropriate prices are for those that both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen's payment statement is a poison.
[Interview cooperation tax accountant] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working at a bank, after graduating from university, he registered as a tax accountant (bookkeeping, financial statements, corporate tax law, income tax law, inheritance tax law) in 2008.
There are a wide range of activities such as university lecturers, seminars and writing.
It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for beginners in accounting.
the white house, a panic without impeachment.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and detailed officials in this matter explained that there was a sense of "great panic" this week against the lack of plans to deal with the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to have increased "security, anxiety and anxiety" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't think it's true."
The White House officials were joking about the lack of clear plans for this situation and the fact that the usual measures that the President has made to deal with the agenda so far could not be applied, so there was no confidence in how to proceed because this claim was so serious.
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" because the President's response to the impeachment was likely to be "incompetent."
Another source of information is that during impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised every day, and some of the close advisers of the President, who are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has spurred concerns over increasingly unpredictable actions and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about Presidents and Politics in the environment of election years.
Trump has faced the greatest threat ever seen in his presidential term, and has changed his hands, becoming an attacker and becoming a defense counsel, including reviving strategies that he considered effective during his Russian investigation.
Trump attempted to lighten the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate with the investigation of political opponents, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of whistleblowers as they were motivated by factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials endured the Mora investigation, but this time they began to feel the difference.
The President, whose powers are branded, seemed to be coming to the press conference on Wednesday, said a detailed person in this situation.
Trump enjoyed questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers have identified the fact that they did not have direct information on calls with President Trump, Vladimir Zelensky, and Ukrainian presidents, which are controversial, and some are convinced that they would undermine the credibility of whistleblowers and reduce damage.
Furthermore, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic family close to the White House points out that the basic support of the President is already very high and that the impeachment will not have much effect on the acquisition of new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to focus on impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those claiming impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how uncertain the response of the president would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the plan, this initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as strategic decision rooms will be implemented in the form.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have a clear leader who can organize public relations activities offensively in order to counter the momentum that the publication of organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, as well as the publication and publication of critical internal accusations on Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic viewpoints is clearly visible, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Steven Munusin, who stated that they would not publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later.
The current pressure is expected to rise from the investigation of Robert Morler, who spoke only through almost inconsistent indictments.According to the person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump and Corrie Luwandouski, who served as the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never talked with the president or close adviser about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmet Frad, who was engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left the White House legal adviser Pat Ciporon with less experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy is generally recognized that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but need human resources to be organized and lead the efforts and political struggles that all have done so.

I had a boyfriend all the time, but due to his work, I had a long distance love ...
I was told to marry someday, but I couldn't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation to marriage with our allies?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Professor Morikawa's advice and must be read from detailed data analysis.
what's this?
I am worried whether I should continue dating my boyfriend in a distant love.
I want to continue living in Kansai where my workplace and my family are, but his place of work is Tokyo.
Since I am working at a trading company, there is a possibility that I am going overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from distant love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (hereinafter - -) C is in a distant relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested at a distance and the two become stronger."
Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) A survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered, but according to the data, only 16% of couples have reached from distant love to marriage.
Since love is done with five senses, the relationship is deepened by seeing the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touch sensation), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long-distance love, there are many cases where you can hear your voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep in touch with the auditory situation.
There is also a cost problem.
If you're going to an opponent's house, you'll be burdened with the time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if you're on a holiday to heal the fatigue of your work, your body will be a factor.
When I go home, I feel relaxed.
Isn't it necessary to break up when it comes to distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure without having to meet frequently or a couple who have a pre-determined time.
Whether you're engaged a year later or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult to see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request.
Senator Debbie Nunes (California Republican) seems to be unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
Thursday, in a comment to defend the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive at the House of Representatives Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of a trial in which Trump asked for an investigation into the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the leftists and their media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the President, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Senator Nunes, Huffpost's senior political correspondent Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democratic Party is trying to find the truth.
The only response to this was the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, Jim Hayes, and many other members questioned whether the answer was a red-naked truth.
Mediate Dotcom speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that were written in steel documents that were controversial.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected shocking claims against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected in Trump's urine at a hotel in Moscow, suggesting existence.
Origami, wallet and real card.
Money transfer, financing, insurance and investment - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to make payments by Origami Pay, as well as transfer money (moving) through collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the problems of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origami ID, you will be able to seamlessly complete your application and transaction, and that you will get information timely.
He also explained that by deploying the Origami app not only on the Origami app but also on the partner company's app, it will be available even if you don't have the Origami app.
In terms of financing, we introduce the functions that can be used to pay back when making payments.
In addition, when funds were needed suddenly, the Origami app was completed from application to repayment.
In terms of insurance, as a partner company, he introduced Aioi Nisei Insurance and First Life Insurance.
The two companies discussed their plans to develop insurance products in line with life events by utilizing their data and knowledge.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually through registration of necessary administrative agencies.
New businesses for effective use of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support effective use of data, including data held by the company, in addition to digitizing customer contacts by its Pay through the payment function provided by Origami.
In partner companies that partner with Origami, such as payment and settlement functions, effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge, such as obtaining structured data such as sales and unstructured data in a real society, accumulating, processing and analyzing data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data along with payment data by its Pay and structured data owned by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technologies and data.

About 140 Japanese people participated, including the chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Mr. Masaaki Hanaga, and Mr. Yukie Ikebe, chairman of the Japan-Korea Music Arts Exchange Association.
At the ceremony, the chairman of the ceremony, Yukie IKEBE, greeted him.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I still can't believe that the teacher died."While preparing for "Remembers," Ms. Mitsuko Ogasawara felt how wonderful and great he was."
On the other hand, he said, "If we can do activities that can broaden our meeting even a little," he said.
After the dedication, the Messe-ji was introduced by Mr. Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the Korea Arts Exchange Association and the Chuchu Institute of International Studies.
Regenerative biofuel research can reduce emissions.
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only aircraft to fly in the air and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid waste such as fat, livestock rendering, and canola oil from restaurants.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% lower than crude oil-based fuels.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology achieved (actually generated) is hydrocarbons of molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technologies tend to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that are already partially developed and maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try it with a reactor to change a little chemical reaction."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Fortune Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare a substitute for the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, and recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a 2500 million production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bressler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but there is no reduction in fuel transport and production.
"As a technologist," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decisions given.

Boris Johnson warned that if Brexit was overturned, Britain would face riots like Los Angeles, and the prime minister would call for calm.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a danger of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson stated that he "nearing anger" was necessary for political words exchanged with intense speech, but insisted that he would not use the term "default."
Despite the appeal of the prime minister to regain his calmness, one minister said to the Times: "In this country, there has never been a kind of riot in Los Angeles in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best movement -- they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and a few populist leaders who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to a innocence.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstration participant Gire Joan, wearing the eye-catching yellow vest, has caused confusion and destruction in the streets of Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives, saying that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It takes less time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a danger of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson calls for the general election to leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a House of Representatives rebellion seeking to lower demands on EU withdrawal and instead to hit the EU with compromises.

Niigata Albirex BB players and staff prayed for victory at Komachi Shinmeigu Shrine in Niigata City on the morning of the 27th.
Last season, Niigata won the club's first district championship.
At the end of the season, however, Davante Gardner was transferred to other teams in the B league.
This season, with new foreign nationals, Nick Perkins, we aim to win more than last season's regional championship.
Captain Jun Uzawa said, "It is important to raise the speed of the head coach's demands and the strength of the defense more than last season so that the results of the victory in the middle district last season will be improved."
The opening match of Niigata will be played on Saturday, October 5, at Away against Albuquer Tokyo.
Pakistani social media celebrity brother, a life sentence for honor murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the incident fades.
"It takes too long, so people forget" women's rights activists, Farzana Bali, Pakistan's first gender school founder, added that even the Barochi incident, which has attracted attention, took more than three years to solve.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "respectful murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the actual number of honorable homicides is much more than that, because it is estimated that Pakistan accounts for approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorable homicides occurring worldwide each year.
Pork cholera measures 1.3 billion yen Add to the September Correction Plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo! News

Floods and disruptions caused by monsoons in many areas
India's monsoon season is about a month long, unprecedented rainfall causes buildings to collapse and death, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month is usually 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, the monsoon will weaken in the late decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays resulted in the collapse of the building and the disaster.
The house was flooded, and the inhabitants crossed the street by water to their knees, usually seen only at the height of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Laguna and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In the northern part of Uttarakand, heavy rains caused damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
For farmers, prolonged monsoons are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmhouse in Bimtal, Uttarakand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables will rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak Monsoon.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dašera on 8 October, with the Hindus setting up Ravana, an evil smiling figure of a beard that appears in the huge comic book-style doll, epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroys evil.
However, since the dolls are made of paper, if the Monsoon pulls long, the last laugh may be Lavana.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides and increased risk of heart disease and heart attack
Recent studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may lead to higher risk of heart disease.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the research.
Dr. Rodriguez is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from over 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuaquini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women and other races because it only targets Japanese-American men.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear years after exposure.
The study found the greatest impact within ten years after exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," said Dr. Rodriguez.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to the aging of the population, which hides the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in the later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides is not important for heart disease and heart attack.
Poloshenko intervention at the conference of Zerensky Trump telephone
The impeachment procedure for President Donald Trump was taken, and the Washington political issue was a dramatic week.
For political novice Vladimir Zellensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
But what has been known about the Zellensky Trump telephone problem so far, and is there a widespread impact on Zelensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the U.S. had many advantages over Ukraine from other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zelensky's response to Trump's objection of 100% rather than 100% is controversial.
Zelensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poloshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the EU's assistance, including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytica said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scolded military aid and asked Zellensky to investigate two rather than one, the first of which was against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second was an investigation of the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hinder European relations or lay backwater against French and German leaders.
I don't want to complain about anyone.
"We thank the people who helped us with the announcement of the call record," said Zelensky at the New York General Assembly.
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled for October.
Ghana won two awards for international civil aviation.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana with an interim implementation rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the UN Air Force's Global Safety Audit Report.
The Safety Award was approved by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding safety at airports and in their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's delayed national zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for security evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was given to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada to Nii Aico Otou, and Director of Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Benad Aliu, in his speech, stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to continue to realize that aviation safety, security, and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also said that the award was a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's intractable efforts and patience.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy, as "airs are likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump appoints Peter Gino as FEMA Chief: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Secretary of State for Emergency Management Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Court at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gino, Deputy Director of FEMA, was in the position of deputy director of government disaster response such as hurricanes and fires.
The office had been absent from the Senate since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, determined that Long had illegally used government-owned cars to commute between Washington and his home Norcarorina, and resigned.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, brought up suspicions that he was drunk in alcohol and involved in a riot, and was excluded from the selection at the beginning of this month after the examination.

CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity of the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, large containers of betanhanie oil were found at an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators also found equipment packed with beep cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," said Captain Kano.
Captain Cano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigations and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used in the Bayp product.
"Only static electricity from clothes can fire, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," said Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions and fires one after another.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigator said that he received an anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still searching for who is the black curtain of illegal Beip activities.
The police said that the office was empty and that Zhang himself thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially about the dangers of bating, to tend illegal babyping products and not go out again.
"I don't know whether it's real or not," he said.
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there are 6 major quakes!
Evacuation training at Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
A practical evacuation drill was conducted at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held every year.
It is assumed that a 6-strong earthquake will occur along the way of the song.
About 300 people attended the training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff.

Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver leaf threads, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Herstic Royal Palace dress collection curator, Ellie Lin, has decided to be one point.
Lin saw this faded piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in one country, which was placed there 100 years ago, and is considered to be part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this gorgeous cloth used as the altarpiece of the church in Bactton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly that room where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one other dress left in the 16th century shows that it was an important discovery throughout the Royal Dress Collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of her sleeves, three years of research have led to the conviction of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The elaborately expensive textile "silver silk cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but also the embroidery of plants and flowers of the "name" quality suggests that the patterns of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later were noble men.
The dress was probably the equivalent of a Tudor mansion at the time of its creation.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rival wearing such gorgeous clothes could not endure.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
I was always happy to hear that the cloth was "great," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one piece of dress that was cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton is unexpected but not so.
Bactton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life.
Although the dress dates back to 1590, experts believe that it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley before Elizabeth died in 1603.
Over 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and fine surgical needles were spent on very delicate hand-sewing altarpieces, will be displayed next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition period.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and the work was taught.
When you look at the front and back embroidered embroidery, you will find a great respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
One week after the missing girl "I searched for the scope of the request" Self-Defense Force withdraws The volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for Misaki Ogura, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared, and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw as "the scope requested was searched."
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces launched a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk such as mountain slopes and Sawa.
On the 27th, there was no way to find a 20-year-old man who volunteered to join the search.
The police and fire departments are planning to continue searching from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, where voters were seeking to invalidate the election.
As a result of the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation, with only 0.71 votes in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 votes in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member is the lowest in the country in the July election.
In the first oral speech on the 27th at the Fukuoka High Court Miyazaki Branch, the plaintiff claimed that "the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional."
In response, the Defendant's prefectural election management committee called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It is not a matter of extreme inequality, but should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

From the bottom left, the station's robotic arm is growing.
JAXA officials who successfully catch and applaud the International Space Station "Konotori" 8 - 28 ( JAXA provided)
The unmanned spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA) carrying supplies to the International Space Station, which is about 400 kilometers high, arrived near the station on the 28th night, and the astronauts during their stay operated the robotic arm.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced under control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, the speed difference is eliminated and the distance is about 10 meters.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters in length is a flow that grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching it to the station, the astronauts carry the luggage.
he's involved in one third of the american drugs
Chicago After the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
Nearly 800 people died of overdose in Chicago last year.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king, commonly known as El Mencio Servantes.
Mexican agent Matthew Donahew DEA said, "Mencho is DEA and, indeed, the top-principles of federal law enforcement agencies."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartels, Harrisco Nueva, are involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "a large amount of cocaine, methane fetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin."
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and sent back to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels.
He owns a large amount of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special maneuver.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho does not punish and defends his empire.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing during treatment.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the solder.
More than one third is thought to be made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively deprive the lives of innocent women and children.
In other words, when someone died, Donahew said that it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news release, PS4 game was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent state of play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to Last of As.
Some of the video games of this new action game were showcased by fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in various ways.
The last of the two parts that I've never seen since the PSwan era were released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"The story is magnificent and complicated in a different way than the previous one," said Dracman.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell stories with so many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game was so spectacular that it did not enter a single Blu-ray, and it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although this surprise is not ruined, Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic notic dogs.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
MLB The Show 19 will be released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including a popular character Ellie's backpack and bracelet replica, and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Local residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th day of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, mobile sales began by the Notoshima Regional Development Council, a local resident.
During the trial until December, wagons with daily necessities, seasonings, and food crossed the Susomachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
Some of the products were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished.
There were 110 wagons, including general vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiro gobo, which are divided into packs, were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Suso-chokai, a line of residents was established, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't think it would sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with his husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I don't know when my father can drive, and I hope he will continue."
Users also received orders such as "I want you to have a cup of coffee, not a canned coffee, but a drip of coffee."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to save "shopping weak."
By December, the 20 town councils within the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed his determination to provide additional $100 million to drought-stricken residents.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by droughts have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been greatly reviewed to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-stricken resident support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will be provided with a maximum of US$100 million in drought relief funds for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion in budget for drought support.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted of killing Steven and Katie Stay and four of the five children in Spring, Texas in 2014.
The authorities said on July 9, 2014 that Haskell was pushed into the house of Stay and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was located.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), thirteen and four sons, nine and seven daughters died.
Only one person in his family, Cashy Stay, who was 15 years old at the time, died.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but then recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed the innocence of Ronald Lee Haskell's heart loss.
The jury was dismissed from prison until Monday.
"If you choose to disappoint us, you will never forgive us."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who was angry was echoed by the leaders of each country.
Global warming is increasing.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people, who raised anxiety and anxiety, protested all over the world, including Japan.
It is estimated that about 4 million people participated in more than 150 countries.
He also set up a message board and marched in Morioka.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will start in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century and to reduce the temperature rise from before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to at least one or five degrees.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed countries and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather conditions, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, are often pointed out to be associated with global warming.
One step of efforts is required to strengthen global warming at a fast pace.
At the summit, which was realized by the call of Secretary General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to virtually zero by 50.
The other 70 countries raised their immediate goals.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy includes zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years" is large.
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's efforts at an environmental-related meeting, said at a conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool and sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of environmental movement.
The damage that cannot be discussed will not be the same as the "replacement of issues" that the person counters.
The international community has to deal with the common crises of humanity.
There is no sufficient effectiveness for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act without taking away that future.
to realize quantum internet
The U.S. Army's research results led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such an Internet may provide military security, measurement and time-keeping capabilities that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute Distributed Quantum Information Center of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state and a measurement is performed on one side, even if the other quantum bits are physically far away, the measurement results are affected by the other.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and leading researcher of the project at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network of physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distances.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured in ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions and excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed into optical fiber cables," says Dr. Lañon.
The team then sent the light particles through a non-linear crystal with a strong laser.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, the optimal value of long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangled network of long-range atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army from precise positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications," said Dr. Frederick Fatemi, an Army researcher who co-operates this program.
