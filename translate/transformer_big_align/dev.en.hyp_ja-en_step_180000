What is Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms suggest that parents and parents are ill.
The Politician is broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, the president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
It was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, with appearances by Gwenness Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, even though the person under the protection is not seriously ill.
There are various types of conditions, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is suspected to be a disease of himself.
However, the representative Münchhausen syndrome implies that others who are clearly protected are ill.
This is also known as FII, forgery or induced disease, and is a type of child abuse.
Although it is a rare symptom, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if children are ill.
So what is the sign of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS is noted as follows.
The child is healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing that they are diabetes.
Overdose medications and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How general is Münchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.
what should we do when we suspect child damage?

Nigeria: Police force a school in Kaduna, rescue 300 children.
The Kaduna Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
The police said that the children were placed in a humanitarian environment, but the school denied this claim.
The residents, who call themselves the school's pastor, say, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering the school, parents signed their consent.
Parents come to deliver meals to their children every day, so they know what kind of environment they are.
I was very surprised that the police came and evacuated the children, and after all the food that parents had delivered, they closed the school.
There are parents who can testify to whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair."
He adds that Abdullahman, former police headquarters, had visited once to confirm what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Corran and that's all.
However, police chief Yakub Savo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage gilly suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind while attending a school in Central Coast, Virginia, and dragged her into the bushes.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to trees and assaulted her.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges of assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on the road and saw a man armed with a large tree branches and knives suddenly coming out of the bushes.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, don't stop."
The man told the girl, "Don't speak loud.
When I hear it, I can't see it."
The man had a knife on his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused for nearly an hour.
When a man spilled the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., with several phone calls and phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood on the clothes of mud, grass, trees, etc., and was involved in street violence, and he claimed that the driver was chasing the bushes, and that he had been around by hand.
The man's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development is based on public interests and warns IT representatives.
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, investors, etc. that if there was no ethical assessment of public interests on Friday, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
At the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and dangers in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions on the future of war technology development and increased machine work were held, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand, and responses by social media companies during the atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, noting how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If advances in technology cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it would not be the right true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological progress is hostile to public interests, unfortunately, it will be counterproductive to a kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they would like to use the expertise of the participants to find human resources capable of becoming future advisors to the Catholic Church on high-tech fields.

Real Madrid loaned players Martin Woodegor, and fans excited with an upturn assist.
Martin Udegor was surprised by Michel Oyalsabar's preemptive support.
Real Madrid won the Ossana at 2-0, renewing the undefeated record of the season in the country, and the top of the La Liga rankings.
However, this season, despite not losing one game at La Liga, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves, was surprised by Michel Oyalusabal's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martín Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite pass through the inside of the other two players to Oyalu Sabal to determine the goal by receiving this completely accurate thru-ball.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third goal of the stunning Oyalusabal penalty spot, Alabeth's Midfiller Manu Garcia secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before the end of 5 minutes.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally achieved this territory.
Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When we contacted this lawsuit, the name of Sharad Powerle was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the name of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Office (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Amit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the Central Authority.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police primary report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit came, the name of Sharad Powerle was nowhere.
In the case of an executive lawsuit and suspicion that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name came up and who mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that the truth would be revealed if the executive conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct and claimed that it had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of a lawsuit registration just weeks before the October 21 elections in Maharashtra.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that it would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
The NCP referred to the action by the Executive Bureau as a political abbreviation.

Stepping the accelerator pedal eliminates accidents!
The following four selections are available: Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driver error.
In particular, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator steps by elderly drivers is increasing.
In particular, when you start suddenly, you will be panicked, and the accelerator will remain on the brake pedal.
There are new vehicles equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such a driver error, but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended vehicles.
After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and at the same time it passes.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] The "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform the pedal mistake from a new perspective.
It is to avoid the pedal mistake by "an alarm sound."
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake with the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
It is to react to the sound and encourage the accelerator to return, and to avoid acceleration by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping.
It is difficult to understand changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf to hear.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excl. tax) and it is easy to set.
[Ashimo Watching kun] The World Wing launched its launch in mid-September, and the Ashimo Watching kun is an accelerator and brake step prevention device.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
When the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped in from the stop (and less than 10Km/h), the vehicle's speed and brake signals are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the rapid advance.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantly control the sudden start by turning it into a creep driving state (the brake is detached in the D range).
It is also equipped with a function to detect the speed of about 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The mounting is only possible with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Ms. Saori Kusumoto (32) of Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked the nursery school suddenly disappeared after the flood, and they were forced to leave at night.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up their homes and have not had enough time to face," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can't panic and say "OK" to children."
Yukari OGUSHI (36) of Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families, including three-year-old children.
He said, "If there is a child who can't stay still, he will use his mind around him."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend my time at home as much as possible in the event of a disaster with food and simple toilets.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinko Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, with a child of 6 years and 8 years old, said, "The elementary school had an e-mail from the school on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or mail system.
There were also requests to build a system that could share the flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "It was okay last time."I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
President Tanaka said, "The opinions presented are also considered to be conveyed to the government as a group."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri is a reference to the police authority.
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandal in London's mayor's office as a criminal offence.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts concerning acts" on suspicions that Mr. Curi had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists if there is information indicating that a crime could have been done," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this matter.
The issue was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations issued by the police in England and Wales.
This issue was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to that of the General Inspectorate at the time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information about his relationship with Arcuri, although he claimed it was "constitutional."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported that U.S. citizens who emigrated to London seven years ago had received preferential treatment from the Mayor of London for £126,000 from public money, and Johnson and other foreign trade delegations three times.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 to the hacker house, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked questions about the investigation process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arcuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among employees."
The move of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory authority touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"In any case, the supervisory authority did not submit any evidence, and the prime minister had no opportunity to answer the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will see the political Kyogen played by the people.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division, was "public secret."
The former staff of the London & Partners (L&P) stated that despite some of the people who considered the company "untrustworthy" at that time, they were privileged to accompany him to trade-related talks abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that general consumers can use to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sasakawa Fund - Yahoo!
I heard about the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawagami (photo), President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the people involved, not the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property for general consumers."
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from anxiety about money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, the operation will not be performed unless you walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result was a 20-year long-term long-term fund and we believe it was because we continued to be a direct sales system that delivered messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box, but the "Sawakami Fund" has all been disclosed.
This is why we can trust you.
mc miller's death, the third drug arrester, the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl, which had been accidentally possessed by Miller before he died of overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Pettyt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Pettyt as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in detention, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutors in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the trial began because of the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate reply to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defenders refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics include a frank word about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke out in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video on his Instagram and published a song called "Suncue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died related to opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died of drug overdose in 2016 and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
This article corrected Walter's spelling of the name Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hidden game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime, and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
The player gets points when they catch a bat from a hiding place.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that "we spend time building games when bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day short-term intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil a chance to experience new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," his father said.
I was so frustrated that I said, "I'm always playing games, but what about making games myself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care about it."
Since then, Basil, who had been interested in learning how to make his own games, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step in game production.
Basil, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has the name of his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it becomes an African innovation, young people like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded a robot that uses program code to organize household chores.
In May, the women's high school team of Ghana, Akrobot, won the 2019 Robofest Contest.
Google and Microsoft giant technology companies are investing in Africa, and Basil and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of bribery.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely accused federal agents of corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware of a false statement to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judiciary documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Haze recognizes.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor charged with the involvement of former members of Hayes in the insurance company's plan to fund the election contributions to the state's insurance director.
Two co-owners, Greg Lindbergh, were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindbergh supported Republican principles and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked him to comment on Friday and email, but he did not reply.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the defendant's lawyer, requested an additional comment by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, stating that Hayes had never spoken with Corsey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Corsey, and also discussed direct bribes with the director.
The indictment, published in April, claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business, and was planning to hold up to $2 million in his campaign to re-election in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no doubts.
In an indictment, a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cosey states that Lindbergh's co-owner instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cosey's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would pay attention if he could move so expensive money, but he eventually broke in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
i understand, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an e-mail asking for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like to post others!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and only posts can be seen.
This new Facebook attempt will start on Friday, and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy director Mia Garrick said that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who consider the number of happy surveys and goodies to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had a very positive feedback from many bullying groups and mental health groups that are working together."
It is only to remove numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchanges rather than the number of nices and reactions.
Garlic said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights they had access to.
It is very early to test in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland and other countries where Instagram conducted tests.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when this test ends or changes.
"There were initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, who is in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very active "technically familiar" Facebook and Instagram user.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.
Rugby World Cup Miracle!
"I've got tears," he said, "I've got tears," in Osaka. - Yahoo!
In Osaka, there was a cheering voice on Venus in Japan.
Takeo Yamanaka (61) = Namihatsu Ward, Osaka City = "Miracle happened!I can't believe it!"
"I thought I was going to be separated because I lost in the first half, but I was surprised by the reversal, and I'm looking forward to it."
Mr. Jo Sugishima (37) = Minoh City, Osaka Prefecture (37) is a professional rugby union player.
"At the moment of victory, I was moved and tears came out," he said, "I am glad to be able to fight against the world's top level, and I should definitely win."
Tony Lin (50), a New Zealander who is visiting Japan with his wife to watch the World Cup, is wearing a Japanese uniform at a pub in Osaka City.
"It was a tough match, but Japan was very good to play.
I've had a lot of success compared to eight years ago, so it's not a surprise."
"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag's fittings are broken, you want to repair them somehow and continue to use them.
It was Cando's handcrafted parts that helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying, don't sell anymore.
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pra product.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main body greatly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this connected fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
As expected, there are 100 percent and everything.
Originally it seems to be a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you put it along with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is very attached.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
But because the ring size is small, the movement is poor ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The number of fittings increased, but because of the lightweight parts, there is no problem with weight.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts has increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, the express train of the JNR, is a temporary train, Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 people, including railway fans, boarded 12 blue cars from Hiroshima Station, and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo between 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, the tour was organized by Japanese travelers.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo Line, Chikuho Line, and Kagoshima Line.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother's life imprisonment with the honor murder of kandir barochi, a Pakistani social media star.
Candy Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His older brother, the popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday, and sentenced to life imprisonment with the most attention of his father-in-law, Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by Balochi, who is famous for being provocative in Pakistan, which is very strong for women's derogatory, although it is not large in Western standards.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
He said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, "Of course," and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan in the eastern city was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
The lawyer said, "Inshirar (the thought of God) will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Baroch's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that he wanted his son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
The killing of Mr. Baroch has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of his misrepresentation of the laws of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "primary murders."
The woman chooses her own marriage partner, and in the case of Barroach, she has been burned, killed, stabbed or strangled by crimes such as praise for her sexuality and shameful family.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
Later, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow the perpetrators to be pardoned by relatives of the victim.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can claim another motive in theory and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted that his son not be pardoned.
However, his parents, who were sad about losing his son, changed his mind and told him to forgive him.
In response to international hatred for murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
His famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a bright red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although criticized and threatened, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the new heavens and earth were opened in a country where expression of oneself as a presence like Kim Kardashian is considered a bold and political activity to improve the status of women.
The origins of the "priority" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

(From left) ASA Amami Sports Academy
【Okinagarabu General Bureau】ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda, Amami City) and Okinaga Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda, China Town) signed a partnership for the promotion of remote island sports on 25th.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects carried out by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both groups mediate and send trainers and instructors when training related to sports.
When a team of remote islands travels outside the island, they will work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association with the ASA, in the event of a tournament on the mainland, such as a prefectural tournament, the support will be provided to prevent the performance of the athletes from falling due to fatigue on board trips and overnight stays.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players who come from outside the island by cooperating with local clinics and hospitals.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Elab Coco in China-cho, where the President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.
After that, the two organizations co-hosted a training session with Athletic Trainer Yuichiro Hidaka.
Local sports boys and club leaders and parents learned how to use taping properly and how to prevent injury.
Mr. Sonoda (52) said, "The purpose of the activities of eliminating the handicap of remote islands in terms of the sports environment is common to each other, and there are many areas that can cooperate with each other.
Mr. Maeda (43) said, "It's hard to have a partnership with a proven organization like ASA, and I want to absorb good things to improve the sports environment for children on remote islands."
Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era in which conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), the non-mote otoko stick to the traditional "man's fantasy" and the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool man.
if you're bound by what you should do, you'll be able to live.
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about the need to learn patterns everyday by looking at various works and behavior of people.
When learning patterns, I think that the brain systemizes behavior by doing this better.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I'm "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you're stuck with the old pattern of "the university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say, "What should I do?" or "What should I do?"
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I've talked about that in my recent talk book, Live - No matter how terrible the world is.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by admitting that person.
It's not that easy.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," it is not easy.
As long as I hear a lot of women, regardless of their position or age, it seems to be a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to wonder what this "cute" is.
what is it?
The illegal state of northwestern Nigeria doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled in the last four months due to increased violence.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, new funding activities for $35.5 million will be needed.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that the Islamic extremist Boko Haram, who has been active in anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in the last ten months in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barok said on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, assault, murder and sexual violence have occurred frequently, and that raiders have destroyed and stolen houses.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime organizations in the area.
However, the army was exhausted by fighting against Bokoharam and the West African branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," he says.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that, in particular, the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the coming months.
a new trial date for a man who killed two women and two children is confirmed.
The guatemara men's trial date was confirmed to have killed two women and their children in Iowa.
According to Polk County Court records, Marvin Escobar Ollyana (31) was indicted for the first-class murder in three cases, the alleged name of Marvin Eskibel Lopez, who had been named by the police at the time the authorities approved.
He pleaded guilty.
According to the police, on 16 July, he shot Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and her son (5).
The court records that a new trial date will be determined on January 27, giving the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare.
According to officials of the U.S. Immigration Customs Bureau, Escobar Ollyana was illegally staying in the U.S. and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.
Sonet Media Networks (SMN) has started advertising on header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their needs.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system in which multiple bidders (advertisers) and fair bid competition can prioritize the delivery of high-priced ads to media operated by media companies.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is said that it is being introduced mainly in major media.
In the past, SSP has been provided through advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in response to the requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase advertising frames in line with advertisers' requests.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP is expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header bindings allow them to participate in direct header binding bids and increase their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, due to the limited number of medium-sized companies, the advertising frameworks for distribution sites in line with individual commercial materials and brand images are also secured to prevent damage to brand value.
One of the advantages for media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each bidder company, called the " wrapper solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, enables efforts to meet the expectations of the introduction of media companies.

Two-month suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that an assistant professor in his 30s at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the General Affairs Department, Assistant Professors of the University of Tokyo, from around October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, they were emotionally emotional and abused in inappropriate words.
He was a teacher of education and was recognized as having deteriorated the educational environment.

Based on the findings from the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
After the survey, the assistant professor continued his education, but through the interview, his actions were improved and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to take all my studies to prevent harassment and try to recover trust."
The university also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students taught by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts Requests Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and make compromises with the EU The Sun
Just three weeks after the EU summit meeting, the Prime Minister's concern is growing around the Prime Minister.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of the EU withdrawal and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations over a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses on the Irish border are packed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative to "impossible."
The Senior Ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose a compromise proposal, such as a three-year time limit on the backstop, to the Conservative Party leader.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU with unconstitutional withdrawals devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings, and insist that the EU will accept the offer to withdraw in limited time.
One Cabinet member said that the ruling that the Supreme Court's closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday was "the alarm," and that "the compromise is the only way we can leave on October 31."
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his steps.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and the Camings project is clearly failing.
It is impossible to fight in so many fields.
Another minister promised to speak to Johnson to carry out the pre-Prime Minister's proposal, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I'm going to tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many things that everyone is trying to end.
If we do not postpone, Boris will end and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris not seriously thinking about the negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a harsh speech, said: "The Prime Minister wants to connect with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Uerres, and discussing with the people in the streets - as if the election campaign was in full swing."
The Prime Minister's spokesman acknowledged yesterday that the agreement was still a long way ahead and said, "If no one wants to make a difference, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month postponement in the event of an unconstitutional withdrawal, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to keep moving forward despite the passage of the bill."
The European Union Delegation Minister Stephen Berkeley returned to Brussels today for further consultation with the EU's Michel Barnier.
The two discuss how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly said in his Glasgow accent that he was told by the bosses of the television station that he would "never succeed."
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was so nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I was working as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Ann Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewed by legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV and ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorraine.
To celebrate the 35th anniversary, she will broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
"The passion and enthusiasm" and "the curiosity" were the key to survival in the television industry, and the moderator said, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting incident was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't even think that many of the families of the children who were killed or injured were watching us live broadcast the show from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, told me to personally meet me, so we talked for hours at her house.
I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In addition, Kelly interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and that "we really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets that are not sure what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fear of traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Konstantino Chiwenga declined the offer of President Robert Mugabe, who had been in the midst of a political change, due to anxiety that it might be a trap to follow military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give the presidency, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Chiwenga refused the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform leaders and African Unions around the world that he was stripped of the regime in a coup, rather than from anxiety.
According to Jamwanda2's Twitter account, officials confirmed that he was a high-ranking official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has held the administration for 37 years, is willing to give the administration to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munngawa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three.
President Spokesman George Charanba, then head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Nepera, and Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Muconoli, were involved in the negotiations, and the senior officials said.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Zimbabwe Reserve Bank, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Chiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to condemn the African Union's actions while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to transfer the presidency to the former CDF was not due to the choice of the former president.
"We started to get tired of some of the late president's family, and it was a wasteful action to save the dangerous and rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, at least diplomatically, there was a little political aim of the late president to change the flow.
If something destroys the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and not be defeated.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would be trapped, and would crush the claims of the commanders who claimed that the constitutional order was not broken.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, would eventually be called a coup and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the president's house, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders at that time read the intent accurately.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa (which we belong to the camouflage group) " were used in the words of an envoy (gono) who conveyed the desperate message of the president, and a strong metaphorical expression "We are not a politician but a political race."
The Army told the local commanders that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed assistance from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at the time, the key South Africans in this process refused to intervene, but, as repeatedly threatened behind it, clarified that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military had invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, it didn't come to fruition," the sources say.
The United Nations Appeals for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons by the Second World War | Shizuoka Shimbun
On the 26th, a meeting was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.
The new five countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and ratified it in 32 countries and regions.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total elimination of nuclear weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern over recent years that there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is nothing else to abolish."
China needs strong leadership.
Before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will be a disaster for the world, going toward division and collapse."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who is the leading figure in the world's second largest economic power memorial ceremony, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he held power in late 2012.
Xi also oversaw the modernization of the military, threatening the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export the development model of its own country, nor does it intend to adopt a model of other countries, but rather merely seek peace.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the bullies, and war and confusion left a deep scar with its pain; China would never give the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in China's Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never abandon its nuclear interests, nor allow security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"The threat of trade war and the rising tariffs are nothing to solve," White Paper states.
China is a mature economic nation with a complete industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a wide market space and a momentum of strong economic development.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities, and opening a new world.
China has no idea of countering the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., so the U.S. should calmly capture the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
The United States would not maintain strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko. (Sport News) - Yahoo!
Yokohama Taka, a famous high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced on August 28, that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as the coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will be determined promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local newspaper had an appeal to the baseball team.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and generally accepted the facts, and he was dismissed on 28 January.
In the summer of 15th, Motochika WATANABE (74), who raised pitchers such as Daisuke MATSUSAKA (currently Nakanichi), left Yokohama.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
From the summer of 16th to the summer of 16th, he participated in Koshien in the summer for three consecutive years.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in autumn, and the Senbatsu tournament in the next spring was hopeless.
The Spice Girls' MelC, the eating disorder, and the diet are banned in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, who had been unable to eat anything other than fruits and vegetables for many years, acknowledged that diets were banned at home.
Sporty spices have been "excessive exercise" for many years under pressure from members of the global pop group, and have subsequently been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chisom told her that her experience influenced her daughter Scarlett's child-rearing and that "every topic about diet in her home is prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his own appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, still in front of SNS Taito, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that the "bad" comments on himself written by the press led to physical problems.
"I didn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, I became obsessed with exercise more and more, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Judiciary judgment on same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch decided to accept the case in a case where 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage could be established between the same sex.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, and there is a system in which local governments, such as Sapporo City, recognize the same-sex marriage.
The court ruled that the two women were actually married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to recognize legal protection for same-sex couples.
The same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of civil law and family register law, but a lawsuit that requires compensation to the country as unconstitutional is conducted in five districts including Sapporo.
We would like to deepen our understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system that recognizes diverse families.
The women lived together for about seven years and received a marriage certificate in the United States.
The court ruled that "the reality of marriage between men and women is not the same" from the results of living together.
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of married couples with the right to marriage in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of which marriage is based only on the mutual agreement.
Both sexes were "unprecedented at the time of the establishment because same-sex marriage was not expected, so it is not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
While the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for the same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women," the problem remained.
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while recognizing the same reality as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, about 70% of people have decided that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification continues, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" recognized by law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in the tax system and the absence of joint custody.
In the examination of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, such as not only marriage between same-sex couples but also the expansion of legal rights for marriage in fact.
The former athlete's trial and jury trial indicted for rape by multiple women.
A jury trial of former Delaware University baseball players accused of sexual assaults by several women is held.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's life luck.
The 21-year-old woman stated that she had been sexually assaulted after sending Conaway to her home by car.
After three weeks of meeting at Bumble, Conaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Konaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault the woman.
The defense argued that women's inconsistent claims and memory differences might have regretted having physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure and said, "It's the next season that I took the pennant." - Yahoo! News
In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final round of this season, and the possibility of his own entry into the CS failed.
If the player wins the remaining three games, they will be replaced.
At the ceremony after the match, Koichi Ogata (50) apologized, "I'm sorry that I couldn't win the final game, and I couldn't confirm my position.
He was a fan of some.
In addition, at the end of his speech, he said, "I will do my best to rob Penant next season."
However, after the ceremony, when asked by the press about the point, he said, "Because it is not finished yet, everything" and stated that he would make a statement after the entire schedule including the post-season.
[Dospo] Ota is the 4th and 20th most self-portrait after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
It became a reward for the seniors.
He took the lead four times, and was on the left side with a liner and took his 20th home run this season.
I reached the number of home runs I was aiming at, "I stopped this number and tried to do it again, and it became a big one."
The director's intention was also firm.
This was the first time a four-point transfer was made.
He said, "I put it in fourth place so that I could swing by thinking."
Oda responded to his expectations, saying, "I felt so excited and entered the game, and I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal 4 statues is the giant Abe who retired from active duty this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads to victory, and the 4th of the team is the result every day, and the 4th seniors who have seen the giant were the same."
Among them, "Abe-san's appearance comes to mind the most, he was a reliable person, and he looked at his back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, obviously in video
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest contributor to the opera house, the Mercury Key, the Luna Park and the famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with suckers, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing through the rainwater flowing through the road into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor to clog the waterway.
Dr. Katherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
Although its appearance is certainly beautiful, it is one of the most polluted estuary of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour are expected to flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drains.
"The heavy rains were falling several times, but the Sydney Harbour after that ... was quite tragic," Dr. Daforon.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastics flowing into the ocean are deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what's there," said Dave Center Manley, owner Richard Nichols, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is underneath the water surface), I think everyone will be really excited.
It is overwhelming, but more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
At least half of the rest are plastics.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing down the water immediately.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of Ocean Protect, said that it is possible for local residents and tourists to reduce plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the use of plastics, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study on plastic and mental health was also announced this month, along with the release and coincidence of this video funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of the activities that make Australians aware of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between 12 and 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
In the study, parents also ranked fourth in concerns about plastic waste, and 93 percent of 551 surveyed parents were increasingly concerned about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Plant was demolished in October | Saga News | Saga Shimbun
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which started demolition work in October, is Futatako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Plant (oil-fired power plant) located in Futatako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantling was used to drain gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991 due to aging.
Each chimney is split from the top of the tower crane and dismantled.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
The man in his 60s, who runs a restaurant nearby, said, "When I look back from afar and see a chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Plant began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because the prefecture's Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station are nearby, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of the nine electric power companies signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

my mentor's advice was to save me.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a teacher, beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
It is different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important as a working person.

About 300-year history of kumidori | Miyako Mainichi Newspaper Website - The latest news of Miyakojima is packed!
Workshops in Kagamihara
Workshop on the role and effect of five instruments played by kumidori (a group dance) = 26th, Kagamihara Junior High School
A joint dance workshop (hosted by the Prefectural Board of Education Education Agency) was held at Kagamihara Junior High School on June 26, 2019.
All the students attended and learned about the 300-year history and birth of dance, as well as the acoustic effects and utilization of musical instruments played.
In the workshop, members of the OB Association of the Ryukyu Performing Arts Department of the Prefectural University of Arts introduced the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing three lines, koto, taiko, kokyu and flute.
The host was Mr. Kawamitsu, who was from Miyakojima City and served the OB Association, and introduced the charm of kumidori.
In this workshop, I learned about the three components of kumidori (music, chanting, Ryukyu dance) and how five kinds of musical instruments are expressed in dance.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
This is the first time in New York City - Yahoo!
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at the past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will revive in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which the International Automobile Federation (FIA) is responsible, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, the race has been held every year to become the world's highest rally championship, boasting history and tradition, and it is said that it is the toughest automobile competition to run on various roads such as gravel and snow roads at high speed.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparation Committee was established to host the event in Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsports Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation) and Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation), both governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, said the following.
Hideaki Omura, Governor of Aichi Prefecture
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with relevant parties to ensure that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Japan as the center of motorsports representing Japan and that it will be a big event to appeal to the world.
Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Many people, including Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motorsports, commented on the event.
The WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Shitara Town) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City, Ena City).
The main venue is "Love Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exhibition.
In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is tasmaniadeville the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient treatment.
Medical researchers have found out how some cancer cells are camouflaged.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
This discovery is expected to create a new method for cancer treatment.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing deadly face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camflage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
"The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy," said Mark Dawson, researcher at Peter McClum.
Conventional treatments may be reused to revitalize markers, or proteins known as MHC, and the immune system may be able to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it can be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where cancer cells escape detection in the same way.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process will happen (to humans and Tasmanian devils)," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may help control the tumor."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting polar stars.
Scientists have discovered a solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-type planets orbit around small stars called red dwarfs, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting the red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, researchers said on Thursday.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, the Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, led this research published in the journal Science.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why it's red."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales stated that the third planet could have been released from its star system in the past, and that it could explain the elliptic orbit of the Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which create a star that orbits itself.
In the most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, the object is generated from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes the atmosphere by the attraction of the eggs of the planet.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star may have been slightly larger than expected, and the temperature may have been lower," Morales said.
As the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant bean dip, was eaten by his colleagues and charged.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating dipping beans with a wake-up agent to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was charged with suspected transfer of methane fetamine, a Class B felony, and taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit issued by OregonLive.com, a suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach deteriorated and her legs fell.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, at a local hospital where a woman went, it was judged that soy dip could contain methane phetamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández "was told the victim's food that he had put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane phetamine in the beans dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows that Medina Hernández turned his camera back and clinched behind the microwave, but pulled something out of the brager.
After that, it is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put the beans dip in a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff has stated that there are no customers who have been contaminated at present.
Medina Hernández is imprisoned in Marion County Prison, instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has been a criminal record of assault, robbery, sneezing, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Asks can be organized" President of JR Tokai, attaching importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on 27th, President Shin Kaneko of JR Tokai reiterated his stance on early construction, stating that the issue of the reduction in the flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the South Alps tunnel of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen line should be discussed with Shizuoka Prefecture, "It is better to separate the issues that should not be organized before starting construction and that should be done after starting construction."
More specifically, he said, "We will talk at the meeting and at the front stage."
President Kaneko emphasized, "When we organize a lot of problems, it is not easy to start construction, and I think it is possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea."
The prefecture is concerned that the spring water that went into the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that "If there is something that can be realistic, but I think it is difficult to think from the safety side of the construction."
The change of the route mentioned by Governor Hirata Kawakatsu denied that it was impossible.
The impact on the opening period was that the three locations of Minami Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station would take a particularly long period of time for construction.

Five Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Saga News | Saga Shimbun
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required reorganisation and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced their hospital name on 26th.
Of the 13 medical institutions in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are surveyed, the 10th highest in the country, and three have already been integrated and transferred.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Midoriki-gun), Takyu Municipal Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital in Taramachi, Fujitsu County.
Of these, Takyu City Hospital and Kojo Municipal Hospital have been integrated to construct a new hospital in Higashi-Takyu-cho, Takyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating surpluses in recent years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi emphasized that "as a town, we have the idea to operate alone and cooperate with hospitals in neighboring towns, and hospitals must remain absolutely for residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The director of the office at Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "We don't hear the contents from the prefecture," and said, "We will actively participate in the regional medical planning coordination meeting in the prefecture, and will respond based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Organization for Promotion of Regional Medical Functions (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not to mechanically determine the direction of public hospitals, but rather to ask for a review at the Regional Medical Concept Coordination Conference in each prefecture."
"I would like to hear from the parties about the future operation of the hospital.
In some cases, it may be necessary to review medical subjects and to further reduce the sickbed."

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise and frequent guests of the Royal Navy aircraft
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use private machines that move royal families around the world for important events and appearances.
Of course, there is a privilege to have a private aircraft.
You don't have to be in the long line of immigration, you don't have to limit the number of baggage, and the Royal Family likes you, and sometimes you can invite guests, including unexpected passengers.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, only Queen and Prince Philip are not frequent patrons of royal aircraft.
During the "Royal Flight Secrets" program, the Queen's former flight attendants revealed that many hairy passengers along with the family often ride.
Bob Seals said, "Sometimes, like a very important royal customer, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggy Dog Privileges are famous, and it is not surprising to ask if you want to take a cute pet to travel with them.
Queen Elizabeth loved dogs when she was young, and it is said that she had more than 30 coggy dogs since she became queen.
In 2007, he had five dogs: Monty, Emma, Linette, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, there were five Cockerspaniel bist, oxo, flash, pick, and spans, as well as four mix dogs cider, berry vulgar and candy.
The staff on the Royal Aircraft will be busy.
The royal staff were seen asking them to leave the dog on the lawn before boarding, and Seals continued.
I've never been in an accident.
The show also found that luggage during Queen's official travel was known for a shocking amount.
According to the Narrator, "There were 12 tons of Queen's luggage on a 44,000-mile British federal tour in 1953."
It is generally understood that it corresponds to two large elephants.
However, the queen does not like fashion.
The Marquesss of Cambridge are also said to have their own preferences when carrying their own clothes, and in Uwasa, they take one seat per dress.

Washington (AP) - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Commission dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the liquor sales permit at the local Trump International Hotel, as the owner's suitability was questioned.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three MPs, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders that most of the petitioners had no fixed assets in Washington State.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on a state law that requires the applicant to obtain a liquor license.
In the first appeal submitted in the summer of last year, he accused President Trump of assault and repeated fraud, claiming that he violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time an appeal was made to update the permit.
The honey collected by Bentley's "Flying Bees" bees is the first harvest!
How is the taste of honey collected by Flying Bees raised on the knees of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September of the same year.
More than 100 bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the premises of a factory to assemble cars?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honey beets produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive officer in the manufacturing department of Bentley, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we set up a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
From wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains, the beekeepers watched how bees are gathering various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers through its Crew Factory and our business.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year and increase the harvest amount of bentra honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to play our role." In May 2019, 1.2 million bees of bees, Flying Bees, were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator, filtered down honey, and then bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with a Bentley-like commitment.
The design of the label was handled by Louise McClum, the designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the Crew Factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we also want to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey such as scones.
it's the worst of the u.K. in a scandalous Cleveland police report.
A police officer named him the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police Department says "a serious deterioration" continues.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley, Director of the Police Department, said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
The police chief Mike Wiel resigned in January, less than a year after his inauguration, but was investigated for "deep" his actions, but for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Herwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee for the illegal act, for the reason that he directed his colleagues to act sexually.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Interior Ministry intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal" and impeachment has to be settled.
No one knows what will happen from now on.
At present, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate."
"We're going to do what we're doing, based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Wolodymyr Zerensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Giulani.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security lawyer in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before the formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not extend to the investigation of political fund violations.
In response to Barr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Committee of Intelligence decides who to testify.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's name in the July telephone talks with the Ukrainian president.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make decisions regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Pelosi said he was "very concerned" about the whistleblowers who became the source of information when Trump attacked the whistleblowers as a spy on Thursday and hinted that they had been treated differently in the past.
The president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about those who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political interests, and wrote a historic step.
The call content is included in the accusations published on Thursdays, in which whistleblowers claim that Trump abused his office in the next 2020 presidential election to seek intervention in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that the White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from ministerial computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian bentheke, speed violation prohibited driving
The Premier League star, Christian Bentek, who was arrested for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.
The 28-year-old forward at Crystal Palace allowed her to drive her Bentley on 20 January, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 speed limit in Richmond, southwest London.
The Belgians then took a speed control camera in March at Patney, south-west London, driving 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek pleaded guilty of these two violations under a single trial procedure in which one of the magistrates tried and sentenced him to light crimes.

Ghana: Concerns about Cofi Manu's composition
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the next GFA Election Review Committee.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davis, and expressed dissatisfaction with it.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the results of the examination process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should be composed of fair and neutral members from outsiders who are not affiliated with each member or have no prior interests.
For example, Davis signed a contract with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if the Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after the ceremony held at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19.
The chairman is Frank Davis, a corporate governance consultant, and the member is Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Appocavi, a sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the planned number was around 50% for new graduates and middle-aged regular employees, and 30% for non-regular employees.
The number of companies who answered "approved" to raise the hourly salary to 1,000 yen was 100 percent, construction (70 and 6 percent), and wholesale (61 and 7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink, and accommodation.
The representative of the conference said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with high part-time and paid hours."
The average amount of money paid was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
After hearing the hiring status of the company in March 2007, there were 61 and 3 percent hiring of regular employees, 54 and 5 percent hiring of mid-term employees, and 15.4% of non-regular employees.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44-7 percent for new graduates, 50-3 percent for mid-term graduates, and 31 percent for non-regular employees.
In particular, the transportation industry (37.5%, 37.5%) and the construction industry (24.1%, 38.1%) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% were employed in the hiring process, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the lower the number of applicants, the lower the company's profile, and the "unable to present favorable conditions for wages."
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the second graduate (department within three years after graduation) and mid-career recruitment.
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% answered that the government has already approved the sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy.
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total showed acceptance.
The number of companies "not admitted" was 64 and 4%, with construction (82 and 8 percent), retail (73 and 1 percent), and manufacturing (72 and 7 percent).
The survey was conducted between July 19 and August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiplic said, "It's time to show you now," when Wales will host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales won the Wallads, he would be the hottest candidate in Pool D and would probably be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory over Wales was the 14th victory, Tiprick and his team would be a straight line for England's best eight races.
"It's a matter of course, I want to challenge both teams and end up winning at the top of the group," said Tiplick, a Welsh Franker.
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win in autumn last year.
Australia thinks it's a lot of blame to return the loan, but it's time to work hard to win it again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And now I'm here, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
Under the supervision of Warren Gutland, all three Southern Hemisphere heavyweight teams have a total of 41 victories.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was included in several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiplic said, "It's hard to answer.
I'm sure the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it was impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, I gave it about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be a little bit narrower than actually."
In order to win Wales, the key is the break-down battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Law.
Up until now, Tiprick has played 67 international matches, and has fought several games and both players in the past, and knows exactly what they are waiting for.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you will always know that you will be facing a tough game from now on.
They are always at the highest level in the world.
I am fully aware of what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the world's most defensive backs players, and Michael is an aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when needed.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself, rather than playing backlow.
I want to fight with the best opponent, and if I play against them, I have to do my best.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important match for us.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you will be able to play a game that won't lose with momentum.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brought "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from a comedian?
A series of issues related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by the dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said in a press conference on July 22 that "the company has no talent at 9 and no such thing at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha are repulsing.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the ratio of "9:1," it would be considered that there was a gift from comedians to Yoshimoto, and investors' view that taxes would be paid is also on Twitter.
If the Gala deal was "9:1," would it be a gift tax?
I heard from Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax, regardless of whether or not the proportion of gala distribution is expected.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not a subject of gift tax in the first place.
If "9:1" is the amount of work for 1 million yen, then Kichimoto Kogyo will earn 1 million yen in sales and 90 million yen in expenses.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you are wondering about allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) away from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as this time, a third party will not be able to decide on how much tax-appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think it's a poison to pay for one yen.
[Interviewing Cooperation Tax Attorney] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working at a bank, he registered as a tax accountant in 2008 (the bookkeeping, financial statements, corporate tax law, income tax law, inheritance tax law).
There are a wide range of activities such as university lecturers, seminars and writing.
It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for accounting beginners.
the white house, a panic without impeachment.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and the relevant parties in detail explained that this week there was a "great panic" feeling against the lack of plans to deal with the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be increasing "in concern, anxiety, and worry" about the possibility that an internal complaint could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't think it's true."
The White House officials joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, or that the normal measures that the President had made to successfully deal with the matter could not be applied, so this claim was so serious that there was no confidence in how to proceed, "It seems not to be erased from the news reported next."
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's unfavorable response to this impeachment over time would increase the likelihood of being "injured."
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised every day, and some of the president's close associates are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable actions and concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means are spurred by concerns about the president and politics in the election year environment.
Trump faced the greatest threat he had ever faced during his term of office, and revived his strategy that he judged effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Moller.
Trump attempted to distract the Ukrainian president's request to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to deprive the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for the factional conflict.
However, many White House officials have endured the Mora investigation, but this time they are beginning to feel the difference.
The President, whose powers are branded, seemed to be coming to the press conference on Wednesday, said a detailed person in this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that damage can be mitigated, claiming that it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information on calls with President Trump, Vladimir Zerensky, and Ukrainian Presidents, which are controversial.
Furthermore, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, Republican strategic families, close to the White House, point out that the President's basic support rate is already very high and that the impeachment will not have much effect on gaining new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those claiming impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how uncertain the response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to an official who explained the plan, this initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have a clear leader who can organize public relations activities in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum of the publication and publication of organizational legal strategies and communication strategies and critical internal accusations to the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspective is clearly visible, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munshin, who stated that it would not be possible to publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president after 48 hours.
According to a person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump, and Corrie Luwandowski, who served as the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we haven't talked with the president or a close associate about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney Jay Cellow is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left the White House legal advisor Pat Ciporon, who had little experience with this, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
Details of the White House's strategy are generally aware that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but that they need to be organized and able to lead the efforts and political struggles that all have done.

The success rate is only 16% Tomoyoshi Morikawa - Yahoo! News
9/6 (Fri) 13:51
I had a boyfriend all the time, but I had a long distance romance due to his work ...
I was told to marry one day, but I couldn't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation with our allies to marriage?
I asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa, who gave a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Professor Morikawa's advice and must be read from detailed data analysis.
what's this?
I am worried about whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during a long distance romance.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I have work and my family, but his place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from distant love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (hereinafter - -) C is in a distant relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested in distance and the two become stronger," but in the first place, is it good for distance love?
Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) The survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered it.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touching), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long-distance romance, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to an opponent's house, you will be burdened with time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even though it is a holiday to heal the tiredness of the work, the body is kata.
When I go home, I feel comfortable.
Is that the only way to break up when it comes to distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently or a couple who have a certain time of separation.
You'll be engaged one year later, or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult to see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request.
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, in a comment defending the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive at the House Information Special Committee, filed an appeal at the beginning of a hearing about the internal charges Trump had asked for the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son to investigate.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicions were "grotesque shows" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"That's exactly what the Democrats of this special committee negotiated with Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude pictures."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Senator Nunes, Huffpost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine if the Democrats were trying to find the truth.
Until now, only Congressman Jim Heims of the Democratic Party of Connecticut has responded, but many other members also question whether the answer of the MP is a red-naked truth.
Mediate.com speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more detailed and unidentified" part, which is said to have been written in the steel document of debate.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected shocking claims against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected by Trump in a room in a hotel in Moscow looking at the release of prostitutes.
Origami, wallet and real card.
Money transfer, loan, insurance, investment - Yahoo!
In addition to payment by Origami Pay, Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to withdraw money (moving) through remittances and collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the problems of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money such as pensions and low interest rates."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have an Origami ID, it will be seamlessly completed from application to transaction, and that you will get information timely.
He also explained that by deploying the Origami app not only on the Origami app but also on the app of partner companies, it would be possible to use the Origami app without having to.
In terms of financing, we introduce the functions that can be used to pay back in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were needed suddenly, it was concluded on the Origami app from application to repayment.

New business for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support effective utilization of data, including data held by the company, in addition to digitizing customer contacts by its Pay through the payment function provided by Origami.
Origami recognizes that effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge in partner companies that partner with Origami and payment functions, such as acquiring structured data such as sales and unstructured data in real society, accumulation, processing and analysis of such data.
Among them, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with payment data by its Pay and structured data owned by its affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.

On September 7, a ceremony was held in Aweena Osaka, Osaka City to commemorate Mitoko Ogasawara, a singer who died at the age of 100 this year.
the people involved showed the representative songs of Ogasawara
Approximately 140 people from Japan, including the chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Mr. Masaaki Hanaga, and Mr. Yukie Ikebe, chairman of the Japan-Korea Music Arts Exchange Association, participated.
At the ceremony, Mr. Yukie Ikebe greeted me first.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I still can't believe that the teacher died," while preparing for "Remembrance meeting," he regretted the death of Mitsuko Ogasawara, who felt how wonderful and great he was.
On the other hand, he said, "If we can do activities that can expand the meeting even a little," he said.
After the dedication, the Messe-ji was introduced by Mr. Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the Korea Arts Exchange Association and the Chuchu International Institute of thought.
Regenerative biofuel research can reduce emissions.
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only airplane to fly in the sky and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology uses low-quality oil and fats for production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude fuel, and other industrial wastes can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology achieved (actually generated) is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technologies tend to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as biofuel for jets.
The first is a low-risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try the reactor to change chemical reactions a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare a substitute for the worst case.
Currently, Foge operates a testing plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin to help build 25 million production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million litres of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not high for fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decisions made after the explanation.

Boris Johnson's camp warned that if Brexit was overturned, Britain would face riots like Los Angeles.
A senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the results of the first round, there was a risk that "a violent riot by the people" would occur in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that he "nearing needs to be avoided" for political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but argued that the term "default" would not be used.
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain his calmness, one minister said to The Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gile Joan or the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country simply because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best movement -- they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and then there's a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to a verdict of innocence.
This year, French anti-government demonstrators with eye-catching yellow vests are causing confusion and destruction in the streets of Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House that if Britain failed to leave the EU, "the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating."
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing the House Rebellion, which lowers the demands for EU withdrawal and instead calls for a compromise to hit the EU.

The opening match of Niigata will be played on Saturday, October 5 at Away against Albuquerque Tokyo.
Pakistan, the older brother of social media celebrities, was sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is often prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the incident fades.
"It's too long, so people forget" women's rights activists and Pakistan's first gender department founder, Farzana Bali, added that even the Barochi incident, which is attracting attention, took more than three years to solve.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "respectful murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much more than that, because it is estimated that about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings of honor-based violence monitoring organizations worldwide every year are occupied by Pakistan.

Floods and disruptions caused by monsoons in India
The Monsoon season in India has been prolonged for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing buildings to collapse and death, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but this month's average rainfall increased by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, the monsoon will weaken in the last few decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune in the western part of India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays destroyed the building and killed several people.
The houses were flooded, and the inhabitants were watered to their knees and crossed the street, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Laguna and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In the northern part of Uttarakand, heavy rains caused damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
For farmers, prolonged monsoons are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmhouse in Bimtar, Uttarakand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but vegetables are rotting by rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pens) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dashera on October 8th, and the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Lavana, the evil smiling figure of the beard-boom appearing in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if the Monsoon pulls long, then the last laugh may be Lavana.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides and increased risk of heart disease and heart attack
Recent studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may lead to higher risk of heart disease.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared with men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"This research highlights the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides at work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure at work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Cakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women and other races because it only targets Japanese Americans.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear years after exposure.
The study showed the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," said Dr. Rodriguez.
This is probably due to the growing importance of other factors related to aging and hiding the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone meeting
The impeachment procedure for President Donald Trump was taken, and the Washington political issue was a dramatic week.
For political novice Vladimir Zerensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
But what has been known about the Zelensky Trump phone problem so far, and is there a wide range of influence on Zelensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zerensky that the U.S. is more convenient to Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's objection of 100% rather than 10% is considered controversial.
Zerensky added that President Macron and Merkel both did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian president Petro Poloshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the support of Russia's sanctions and economic aid in the EU during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Vojtica said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scolded military aid and asked Zerensky to investigate two rather than one, the first being against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is the investigation of the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is uncertain whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to say bad about anyone.
"We thank the people who helped us with the announcement of the call record," Zerensky said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana with an interim rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification survey (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Air Force's Global Safety and supervisory audit report.
The safety award was approved by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding the safety of the airport and its own airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's long-running zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for safety evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada to Nii Aiko Otou, and Director of Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Bennard Aliu, stressed the need to maintain the safety of participating countries.
"It is important to remain aware that aviation safety, security, and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also said that the award is a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's incompetence and patience.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a tremendous potential to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to change our lives dramatically."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump and Peter Gino are appointed as FEMA Chiefs: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Senate Committee held at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Director of FEMA, was the deputy director of government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been absent since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, determined that Long had illegally used government-owned cars to commute between Washington and his home, Norcarorina.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, raised doubts about drunkenness and involvement in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of the month after the examination.
Mr. Gianno's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Authority in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in San Gabriel Valley
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity of the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of Butanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found at an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators also found equipment packed with beep cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," said Captain Kano.
Captain Cano said that he had previously been engaged in drug investigations and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used for the beep product.
"It is possible to fire static electricity from clothing alone, and because it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," said Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions and fires one after another.
The danger handling team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigators said that it received an anonymous information and led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still searching for who is the black curtain of illegal Beip activities.
The police said that the office was empty and that Zhang himself believed the office had a store.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to avoid frequent illegal babyping products.
"I don't know if it's real or what I'm buying."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a 6-strong earthquake!
Evacuation training at Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
A practical evacuation drill was conducted at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held every year.
On stage, there is actually a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department, and it is assumed that there will be a 6-strong earthquake in the middle of the song.
Approximately 300 people attended the training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff.

Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was woven with silver foil yarns made of the finest camlet silk, and the gorgeous embroidery of plants, animals and butterflies was fluffy.
Elery Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, has decided to be one.
This faded piece of cloth, hung on the wall of a small church in one countryside, is said to have been placed there 100 years ago and is thought to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this luxurious cloth used as the altarpiece of the church in Bactton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly that room, where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
The only remaining part of the 16th century dress is that it was an important discovery throughout the Royal Dress Collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of the sleeves to the dress, three years of research have raised the conviction of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The elegantly expensive textile "silver silk cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but also embroidered plants and flowers with the quality of "myote," suggesting that the later addition of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen, bears were noble figures.
The dress was probably the equivalent of a Tudor mansion at the time of production.
In addition, it is speculated in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rival wearing such luxury clothing could not bear.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
Everyone was always happy to hear the cloth saying, "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one of the dresses that were cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton is not as expected.
Bactton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and the local legend says that the cloth has long been associated with Parry.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on a very delicate hand-sewing altar cloth next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and the work was taught by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you're really impressed by the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the back and on the front, you will find a great respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched" A week after the missing girls, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew The volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl is missing at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces (SDF) closed the search and withdrew on 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared, and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 police and SDF personnel.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw their request, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk such as mountain slopes and Sawa.
On the 27th, there was no way to find a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search.
The police and fire departments are planning to continue searching from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters were seeking to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the Plaintiff appealed for election invalidation, as compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member is the smallest in Japan in July this year, with only 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture.
In the first oral speech held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that "the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional."
In response, the Defendant's prefectural election management committee called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It is not a matter of significant inequality, but it should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

Arriving at an unmanned supply unit, space base Catching with a Robot Arm | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
No. 8 of the "Konotori" drone arrived at the International Space Station.
From the bottom left, the station's robotic arm is growing.
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th.
On the night of 28th, the unmanned spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) of about 400 kilometers, arrived near the station, and the astronauts during their stay operated the robotic arm and caught it.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced with the control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the speed difference and approaches about 10 meters away.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters in length is the flow that grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching to the station, the flight attendants carry luggage.
he's involved in one third of the american drugs
Shortly after the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
Nearly 800 people died of overdose in Chicago last year.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named Nemecio Servantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Matthew Donahew DEA executive officer in Mexico said, "Mencho is DEA and, indeed, the top-priority of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
The prize money raised by El Mencho reached $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forests of El Mencho were destroyed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva, is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "mass" cocaine, methane phetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's head received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said that he actually owns his own special maneuvers.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho does not punish and defends his empire.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is marked by a smuggler.
More than one third is thought to be made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively deprive the lives of innocent women and children.
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the past.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to the Last of As.
Some of the video games of this new action game were also showcased by fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Noty Dog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
The last-of-as-a-part 2 has been released on multiple discs since the PSwan era.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous work, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell stories with many characters like this.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved to that extent.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game was not a big one, but a two-disc disc.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 includes one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it doesn't want to ruin this surprise, Easter eggs in the game include nostalgic notydog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced a free PS4 game for PlayStation Plus, including the aforementioned Notic Dogs, in October 2019.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Ellie's backpack and bracelet replica, and the award-winning version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima mobile sales "help" council attempts Residents wish to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging population, mobile sales started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council (NTO).
In an attempt until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings and foods crossed the Suso-chokai and Hanpo-chokai on the first day.
There were also products that were sold more than expected and quickly replenished, and residents asked for continued "help" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including general vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiro gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Susomachi-kai, people's columns were formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council expressed his surprise that "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with his husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope he will continue."
The user also ordered "not canned coffee, but I want coffee to be dripped by myself."
The council considers the goods that were requested.
On Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to save "shopping weak."
By December, the 20 community meetings on the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they will continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to provide additional $100 million to drought-stricken residents.
Cash support policies for farmers suffering from droughts have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been significantly revised to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-affected resident support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive assistance from drought relief funds with a maximum of $100 million in infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted more than $7 billion for drought relief.
Ronald Lee Haskell: An ex-wife family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted of killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of the five children in Spring, Texas in 2014.
The authorities said on July 9, 2014 that Haskell was forced into his residence and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department announced that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 sons, nine and seven daughters died.
Only one person in his family, Kasshidi Stay, was 15 years old, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's claim of innocence.
The jury was dismissed from prison until Monday.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
Is the appeal of a girl who shook her voice with anger echoed by the leaders of other countries?
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people, who raised anxiety and anxiety, protested all over the world, including Japan.
It is estimated that about 4 million people attended in more than 150 countries.
He also set up a message board in Morioka.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will be launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to 1/5.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed countries and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is pointed out to be related to global warming in various places.
In order to achieve a faster pace of global warming, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit held by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy includes zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century.
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at an environmental meeting, said at a conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal does not deny, but is too poor compared to the appeal of the girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The damage that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "replacement of issues" that the person himself opposes.
There is no longer a grace to cope with global warming, and the international community must respond to the common crisis of humankind.
There is no sufficient effectiveness for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is adults who should act to avoid taking away the future.
to realize quantum internet
The results of the U.S. Army's research have led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and timekeeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute Distributed Quantum Information Center, funded and operated by the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - 50 km from optical fiber cable.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state and one is measured, even if the other quantum bits are physically far away, the measurement results are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, an experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distances.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains enough quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum network use.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and at the same time excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
The team then sent the light particles through a non-linear crystal with a strong laser.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, the optimal value of long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangled network of long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is an important field for the Army from the perspective of accurate positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications."
