Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia, protesting the neighboring Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in the town of Novgorod, Bosnia, strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the barracks in Trugovska Gola, and vow to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," and "Don't stop it."
We must oppose it.
The head of the municipality of Novi Grad, Miloslav Driaka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will hold discussions next week to discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
On Friday, Croatian national broadcasters reported that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or to pay the cost of the waste of Croatia to be processed in a newly constructed facility.
Tomislav Chorich, Minister of the Environment and Energy of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia had problems in the disposal of public facilities waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wanted to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would Bosnian pants pocket - that is, Turkovska Gola - be the best place in Croatia?"

PayPay Yasuda: "Is there any payment method other than cash?"
Mr. Shinmi, President of Takeyoshi Co., Ltd.: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it's easier than cash if I get used to it because it won't be possible to receive Tsurisen.
To date, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce 20% of our usage by points.
Mr. Yasuda has been increasing the number of users explosively, but Mr. Yasuda is a salesman who sells the introduction of PayPay to customers, that is, the store.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also listened to Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's a peak now.If you're not able to talk about it before you jump in, or if you're going to do a consumer reduction business together, I'm going to ask you about it with PayPay.
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the country's consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves, but the country's "consumer reduction business."
The country's consumption tax hike in October introduced a system to reduce the maximum amount of shopping to consumers by 5% to prevent the cooling of consumption.
Like "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before tax increases.

What is the representative Munchhausen syndrome that appeared in The Politician of Netflix?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are sick.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, who aims to become President of the United States, but it is the first step to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinness Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, despite the fact that humans under their protection were not seriously ill.
There are various types of pathology, including Munchhausen syndrome, which is suspected to be a disease of himself.
However, the surrogate Munchhausen syndrome is clearly false that others under their protection are sick.
This is also known as FII, a type of child abuse.
Although it is unusual, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following as a precaution.
The child is healthy, but if he is sick, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as by mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Overdose medications and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How general is Münchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that 89 cases of 100,000 people had occurred in two years.
what should we do when we suspect a child's damage?
Ask local social welfare organizations or call NSPCC Children's Protection Helpline 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police forced a school in Kaduna, rescued 300 children.
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
Police say that the children were placed in an inhumane environment, but the school denied this claim.
The residents, who call themselves the school pastor, say, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
The parents came to deliver a meal to their children every day, so they knew what the environment was.
I was very surprised that the police came and evacuated the kids, and all the food that the parents had delivered left, and then closed the school.
There are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair."
He adds that Abdullahman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Corran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhumane environment.
Many children had a scar on their back.
So we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

An order to confront the victim in a courtroom for rape of a girl dressed in camouflaged "extraordinary delinquency" of Central Coast.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending school in Central Coast, Virginia.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to trees and assaulted her.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, the man convicted seven suspects, including three charges, including this assault and grooming against another 11-year-old girl, and sexual abuse.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on the road and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and a knife suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, don't stop."
The man told the girl, "Don't speak loud.
When I hear it, I can't see it."
The man had a knife on his right hand and the girl's hands tied in a cable tie, then struck the tree and abused him for nearly an hour.
When a man spilled the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., without responding to several phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood out with mud, grass, and trees on his clothes, and was involved in street violence and chased the driver down to the bush, claiming that he had been around by hand.
The man's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, warning IT representatives that AI development is based on public interests
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, investors, etc. that if there was no ethical assessment of public interest on Friday, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethicologists met.
At the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of war technology development and increasing machine work, and at the same time, case studies were conducted on gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and social media companies' response to the atrocities.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from human beings.
"If the advancement of technology causes increasingly noticeable inequality, it is not the right true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will be counterproductive to a kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to use the expertise of the participants to find human resources capable of becoming future advisors to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.
Nagano Supplies directed by G Abe!
thank you, master.
Hisayoshinote (34) of Hiroshima and Nagano started his career in the mid-day battle (Mazda) on the 27th.
The first two-death second base hit was "September" by Earth Wind & Fire on the appearance of giant Abe who announced his retirement this season.
The result was a liner, but a sensitive fan who noticed Nagano's stylish surprise was applauding.

Real Madrid's loan, player Martin Woodegor, and fan excitement with an assist.
Martin Udegor showed a surprise support for Michel O'Yalsabar.
Real Madrid won the Ossana at 2-0, renewing the record of the loss in the domestic season, and moving to the top of the La Liga rankings.
However, this season, despite not losing one game in La Liga, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champigns League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Udegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves, was surprised by Michel Oyalusabal's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martín Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, was a dribble that pulled the opponent's crotch and sent an exquisite pass through the inside of the other two players to Oyarsabal, where he scored the goal with this perfectly accurate thruball.
The second goal of Willian Jose and the third goal of the stunning Oyalusabar penalty spot ensured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before Alabeth's midfiller, Manu Garcia, dropped out in 5 minutes.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated this territory.
Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When we contacted this lawsuit, the name of Sharad Powerle was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank Fraud incident involving thousands of rupees.
The agency's executive branch (ED) filed a fund-cleaning lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew, former Vice-Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Agit Powerl and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit was reached, the name Sharad Powerle was nowhere.
An executive's lawsuits and suspicions that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name emerged or who mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that the truth would be revealed if the executive conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud case.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the October 21 Maharashtra parliamentary election.
The former coalition minister clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
The NCP referred to the lawsuit by the Executive Bureau as a political abbreviation.
South Africa: An arrest of a 20-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a student of UKZN, Cinesenba Rdov.

According to Colonel Tembeka Mubere, a spokesman for the Kuwazuru Natal Police, a 20-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday.
The police said in this week that he was stabbed under the left side and abdomen.
She is said to have been a customer at the Musinga Drifkarna Motorsports event on Saturday evening.
In a statement issued on that day, the organizers of the motor sports event stated in a preliminary report that the customer factor remained after the event's work to watch the music performance.
Unfortunately, one of them was attacked by strangers on the way, and then died in the hospital.
In response to her death, UKZN temporarily suspended academic activities on Friday, stating that "We need to consider the frailty of life as a community and the brutality that often occurs in this society."

On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had classified epipen as "Generic" in the Medicadian drug rebate program.

Stepping the accelerator pedal eliminates accidents!
Four quick-start prevention devices that can be reared - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by a mistake in driving.
The number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistake by elderly drivers is on an increasing trend.
Especially when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes a panic, and sometimes the accelerator continues to step on the brake pedal.
There are new cars equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such a mistake, but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended cars.
This system is designed and sold by after-part manufacturers.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and you step on it at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] The "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform you of pedal mistake from a new perspective.
This means that the pedal's mistake can be avoided with the alarm sound.
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when you stop or slow down.
It is to react to the sound and encourage the accelerator to return, and to avoid rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the mistake.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf to hear.
The mounting is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excl. tax) and it is convenient to set up.
[Ashimo Watching kun] The world wing was launched in mid-September to prevent the accelerator and brake step errors.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
At the time of the stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the rapid advance.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator and instantly control the sudden start by turning it into a creep running state (the state that left the brake in the D range).
It is also equipped with a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The mounting is possible only with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Saori KUSUNOMOTO (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked nursery school suddenly lost their desire to go to nursery school after a flood, and they began to stay overnight.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up the house and have not had enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can not panic and say, "It's okay."
Yukari Okushi (36) in Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
"If there is a child who can't stay still, I'll feel around it."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water around her house.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the event of a disaster with food and a simple toilet.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinko Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, with a child of 6 years and 8 years old, proposed that " elementary school had a closed school e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or mail system.
There was also a request to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I don't know what it was like last time."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
TANAKA said, "I think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri, a female businesswoman
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandal in London's mayor's office as a violation of the Penal Code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts concerning acts" on suspicion that Mr. Curi had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"The matter of conduct exists in the presence of information that indicates the possibility of a crime."
This has never been proven.
IOPC will examine whether it is necessary to investigate this issue.
The issue was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations made by the English and Welsh police.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the General Inspector of Police at that time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, despite insisting that it was "a mistake."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported that the Americans who moved to London seven years ago had received preferential treatment for Johnson to pay 126,000 pounds from public money during the Mayor of London, and to join three foreign trade delegations with Johnson.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 to the hacker house, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked questions about the investigation process taken before the grant is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the phone numbered was transferred to the California office where Mr. Curi (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among the staff."
The movement of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory authority touched the anger of the Prime Minister's official residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The director did not submit any evidence on any charges, and the prime minister was not given an opportunity to answer the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late on Friday."
Both the people and the mass media will see the political Kyogen that was created by the people.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division, was "public secret."
The former staff of the London and Partners (L&P) stated that despite some who believed that the company was "untrustworthy" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany him to a foreign trade-related meeting led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, about the outlook for the future.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back on the past 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, many people's thoughts and efforts have been made in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep appreciation to all the people involved, not the history that I have played with the power of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit remains unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from the anxiety of money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operations do not yield results unless they walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world."
We believe that this is the reason why we have become a long-term fund for 20 years and that we have continued to be a direct sales system that can deliver messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxychodon containing fenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had previously held before he accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Pettyt as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against individual cases.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for the 2005 drug case, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutors in charge of the case reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday called for Walter to be detained until the start of the trial because of the high possibility of escape.
There was no immediate response to the phone call to the lawyer.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram, and released a song titled "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died related to opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of rock band Three Doors Down, died of drug overdose in 2016, and Fentanil and Hydrochodon were detected in the body.
This article corrected Walter's name as Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
These nine-year-olds are using a free programming app called Scratch2 to create a hidden game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats coming out of hiding places.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that "we spend time building games when we're bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil a chance to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but what about making games myself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care about it."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives the game its name as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it becomes an African innovation, young people like Basil take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded a robot that uses program code to divide housework.
In May, the women's high school team Akrobo won the 2019 Robofest Contest.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman faked a federal agent investigating corruption in major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' attorney, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Hayes admits.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor charged with the involvement of former Congressman Hayes in the plan of the insurance company's heavy duty to fund the election to the state's director of insurance.
The two co-owners, Greg Lindbergh, were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016, and has become the state's top political donor in recent years.
Lindbergh supported Republican principles and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked him to comment by email on Friday, but he did not reply.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the defendant's lawyer, requested an additional comment by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken to Cosey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Corsey, and that he spoke directly with the supervisor.
The indictment published in April claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business, and was planning to hold up to $2 million in his campaign to re-election in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindberg's company.
Republican Corsey reported alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them out.
Cozy has no suspicions.
Indicted in a conversation, including Lindbergh and Cosey, it is described that Lindbergh's co-owner instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would pay attention if he did so much money, but he eventually broke up in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an email asking for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users would soon like to post others!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and only posts can be seen.
This new Facebook attempt will start on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia policy director Mia Garrick said that this change was based on feedback from mental health professionals who would consider the number of happy surveys and the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had a very positive feedback from many bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
It is only to remove numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange rather than the number of nices and reactions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more securely than they feel competitive.
Garrick said that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights they've accessed so far.
It is very early to test in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when this test ends or changes.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a step to listen and learn to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very aggressive "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram user.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If my favorite bag is broken, I want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was Cando's handcrafted parts that helped me at that time.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pra goods.
Therefore, if you ask the shop for repairs, the price of the main unit was significantly higher.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for what changed to this connected fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it in the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It is originally a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you put it on one side of the bag, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is very attached.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So I decided to make the ring a couple of times.
The amount of metal fittings has increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight has no problem at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts has increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, the express train of the National Railways, is on a temporary train Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours journey | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train with the image of the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy a special train trip inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A special train, which was inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era, was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded 12 blue cars from Hiroshima Station and left Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" organized by JR companies, Japanese travel was organized.
The train is made up of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs on the Sanyo, Chikuho and Kagoshima lines.
A special headmark was drawn by Mt. Aso.
his brother was sentenced to life for the honor murder of kandir burochi, a social media star in pakistan.
Candy Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment with the most attention of his father-in-law, Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by Balochi, who is famous for being provocative in Pakistan, which is very strong against women.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
He said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, "Of course," and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, convicted and sentenced him to life in a waiting sentence.
The lawyer said, "Inshirar (the thought of God) will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Balochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
The killing of Mr. Balochi has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of lightening the rules of the father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "honorary murders."
The woman chooses her own marriage partner, and in the case of Barochi, she burns, kills, stabs or strangles her family with crimes such as praise for her sexuality.
The killing is usually done by the close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow perpetrators to be pardoned from their relatives.
Three months after Barochi's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can claim another motive in theory and may be pardoned.
In Barochi's case, his parents initially insisted not give him a pardon.
However, his parents, who were sad about losing his son, changed their minds and told them to forgive him.
In response to international hate for murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a straight red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although it became critical and threatening, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the new heavens and earth were opened in a country where expression of oneself as a presence like Kim Cardassian is considered a bold and political activity to improve the status of women.
The roots of the "priority" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

In addition to actively cooperating in projects conducted by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will establish mutual support systems in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands visit the island.
Both organizations mediate, dispatch and share information about their trainers and instructors when training related to sports.
When a team of remote islands embark on an expedition outside the island, they will work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association with the ASA, in the event of a prefectural tournament and other tournaments on the mainland, we will support the reduction of the performance of the players due to fatigue during a boat trip or staying overnight.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players who come from outside the island by cooperating with local clinics and hospital officials.

Kenichiro Mogi "Now is a time when traditional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Mr. Shigeki has extorted that the incomprehensible otoko adheres to the traditional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool man.
if you're bound by what you should do, you'll want to live.
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about various works, people's behavior, and needs to learn patterns every day.
When I study patterns, I think that the brain can systematically act like this, so I think that I will be able to live in Lak.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I'm "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
I taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you're stuck in the old pattern of "a university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will live.
Because people and society change even if they don't change.
I've been talking about that in my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by admitting people.
He doesn't want to be light.
It is painful if you ask yourself around.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, his surroundings will be treated as "a great film director."
Those who have a track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," you cannot be light.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of their position or age, it seems that "cute" is a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to say what this "cute" is.
what is it?
In the northwest of Nigeria, the illegal state doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 due to increased violence over the past four months.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, each institution will work together to raise funds for $35.5 million.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Bokoharam, an Islamic extremist organization that has been working on anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Nigeria over the past ten months in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"We see the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok said on Friday to the press.
Abducts, tortures, assaults, murders and sexual violence have occurred frequently, and the mediator said that raiders have destroyed houses and worked for theft.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoharam and the West African Branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," says Balok.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR stated in a statement that the security situation in Sokot, particularly in the state of Sokot, was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger were expected to increase in the coming months.
the men who killed two women and two children confirmed the new trial date.
The date of the guatemara men's trial was confirmed to have killed two women and their children in Iowa.
According to Polk County Court records, Marvin Escoral Orryana (31) was prosecuted for the first-class murder in three cases, the false name of Marvin Esquibel Lopez, who had been named by the police at the time the authorities recognized it.
He pleaded guilty.
According to the police, on July 16, in a demo-in housing, he shot Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and her son (5).
The court records that a new trial date will be decided on 27 January, giving the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare.
According to officials of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Bureau, Escobar Orrillana was illegally staying in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.
The Sonet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising on header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks in line with each advertiser's request.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a mechanism in which multiple bidders (advertisers) compete in fair bids to prioritize high-priced ads to media operated by media companies.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
In the past, SSP has been providing advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to specific ad frameworks that have a high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," the LFP was launched in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase advertising frames that meet the needs of advertisers.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP is expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header binding allows them to participate in bids directly to the header binding target ad frame, which is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, due to the limited number of media companies in the target market, the advertising framework of the distribution partners in line with individual products and brand images is secured, preventing damage to brand value.
One of the advantages of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each bidder company, called the "wrapper solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, will enable efforts to meet the expectations of the introduction of media companies.

The punishment is the same date.
According to the General Affairs Department of the University of Tokyo, Assistant Professors of the University of Tokyo, from around October 2017 when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, repeated intimidating behavior such as being emotional and abused in inappropriate words, and gave strong mental stress.

Cabinet Revolts Called Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and to make compromises with the EU The Sun
Just three weeks after the conclusion of the EU summit, there is a growing concern around the Prime Minister that the prime minister might be out of time to withdraw significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding the withdrawal of the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations over a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are tight, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative to "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel will propose a compromise proposal on the ground, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings without agreement, and insist that the EU accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One Cabinet member said that the Supreme Court's ruling that the closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday was "a bell," and that "the compromise is the only way we can leave on October 31."
We will never win in the House and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his steps.
There is no effect on the extremes, and the Cummings plan clearly fails.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another minister promised to speak to Johnson to carry out the pre-Prime Minister's proposal.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many things that everyone is trying to end.
If we postpone it, Boris will end, and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a harsh speech, said: "The prime minister wants to make an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting the bulls, inspecting eggs in the Whales, and discussing with the people on the streets.
The prime minister's spokesman admitted yesterday that the agreement was still a long way ahead, saying, "No one can make a difference - if it is to achieve the goal, the journey is still long."
However, the press also said that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month postponement if it does not agree, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill has hindered our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue moving forward despite the passage of the bill."
Stephen Barclay, Minister of Departure of the European Union, returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by the TV station boss that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was so nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and to see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and then began a program named after her.
In celebration of her 35th anniversary, she will broadcast a special show about Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
"The passion and enthusiasm" and "the curiosity" were the secret to survival in the television industry, and the moderator added, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think that many of the families of children who were killed or injured were watching us live broadcast the show from Dunbrane.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna was killed, told me to personally meet me, so we talked to her at her house for hours.
Not taking all of that on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and saying, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets that are not sure what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine was broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fear of a trap.
According to government officials, Vice President Konstantino Chiwenga refused the offer of a presidential post from former President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to fears that it might be a trap to trace military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give him the presidency, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Chiwenga refused the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of his government in a coup, rather than from anxiety.
According to Jamwanda2's Twitter account, officials confirmed that he was a high-ranking official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munngawa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
Mogabe, aware that he was losing power, told the government officials that he had made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three.
It was reported that President Spokesman George Charanba, former deputy chief of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, Aaron Nepera, and the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Muconoli were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, tried to denounce military action by the African Union, seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the presidency to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was a wasteful action to start fatigue in part of the family of the late president and to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there was a little political aim of the late president to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If anything destroys the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I hope you remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and crushed by the commanders' claims that he had not broken the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the whole situation, would decide whether it would be a coup, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that they would not turn guns to the citizens, even if they had invaded the president's house called Blue Roof.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders at that time read the intent accurately.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa (which we belong to the camouflage group) " were used in the words of an envoy to convey the desperate message of the president, officials said, "We are not a politician nor are we in the midst of political competition."
The government officials said that through the military commanders who stayed in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munnagagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at that time, South Africans who were key to this process refused to intervene, but as repeatedly threatened behind it, it was clear that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, it didn't come to fruition," the sources tell the Independent.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to the ban on nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th at the UN Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and Michi Takeuchi (63), the granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, delivered a speech and appealed to the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
Five new countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and ratified it in 32 countries.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern in recent years that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is no other way to abolish it."
China needs strong leadership.
Before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party's administration 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will lead to division and collapse, and it will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified dealing with problems in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the control of the party since he held power in late 2012.
Mr. Xi has also directed a military modernization program that threatens the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development model, nor does it intend to adopt a model of other countries, but merely seeks peace rather than hegemony.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the bullies, and war and chaos left a deep scar with that pain; China would never take the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in China's Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "delete" its core interests, nor allow it to undermine security and sovereignty.
"The threat of trade war and the rising tariffs are nothing to solve," says White Paper in connection with the trade dispute with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and momentum for strong economic development.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am confident that China has the power to face difficulties, turn crisis into opportunities, and open a new world.
China has no idea of countering the U.S., and the U.S. doesn't want to replace it.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
If you try to suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad, the United States will not maintain strength.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka dismissed director Hirata and director Kaneko (Sports News) - Yahoo! News
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as a coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.
As for director Hirata and director Kaneko, the local newspaper reported on the 26th that there was a rumor about baseball club members.
After hearing the situation from the two students, director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, in light of the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they generally accepted the facts and dismissed them on 28 September.
In the summer of 1515, Motochika WATANABE (74), who was raised by Daisuke MATSUSAKA and others, left Yokohama.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
In the summer of the 16th century, he participated in the Koshien Garden for three consecutive years.
However, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals this summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in the autumn, and the Senbatsu tournament in the next spring was desperate.
The Spice Girls' MelC, the eating disorders, and the diet topics are prohibited in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, from his experience of eating nothing but fruit and vegetables for many years, admitted that diets were banned at home.
Sporty spices have long been "excessive exercise" under pressure from members of the global pop group, and have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by his daughter Scarlett's child-rearing, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old, and I'm getting a lot of attention to my appearance," says Mel.
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking to my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when she gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, in front of SNS Taito, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that the "bad" comments on herself written in the media led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out a certain group of foods, I became obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Judiciary judgment of same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch judged that it was a lawsuit in which 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage was established even between the same sex.
More than 20 countries recognize same-sex marriages, and there is a system in which local governments, such as Sapporo City, recognize same-sex partnerships, are not legally effective in Japan.
Based on this, the decision was approved by two women.
It is considered the first judicial decision to recognize legal protection by same-sex couples and is meaningful.
As a result of the Civil Code and the Family Registration Act, it is not permitted to marry same-sex couples.
We would like to deepen our understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system to recognize diverse families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The decision was based on the results of the two living together, and recognized "the reality that is not the same as marriage between men and women."
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of actual marriage with the right to conform to marriage in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of "freedom of marriage" as marriage is "only based on mutual consent."
Both sexes were "unprecedented at the time of the establishment of the same-sex marriage, and the purpose of denying same-sex marriage is not understood."
"The Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," and it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, the problem remained that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women."
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while recognizing the same situation as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, about 70% of people believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" recognized by law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in the tax system and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriage between same-sex couples but also the expansion of legal rights for married couples.
to the trial and jury trial of former athletes prosecuted for rape of multiple women.
A jury trial is held for former Delaware University baseball players who have been charged for sexual assault on multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
A 21-year-old woman tells her that she was sexually assaulted after she drove her home.
The two met after three weeks of meeting at Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault the woman.
The defense argued that women's inconsistency and misrepresentation would have regretted having physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure and said, "It's time for the next season to rob Penant" - Yahoo! News
In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final game of this season, and the possibility of his own entry into CS failed.
If the player wins the remaining three games, they will be replaced.
At the ceremony after the match, Takashi Ogata (50) apologized, "I'm sorry that I couldn't win the final game, and I couldn't confirm the ranking.
Some fans were invited to play.
In addition, at the end of his speech, he suggested that he would "do his best to rob Penant next season."
However, after the ceremony, when asked by the press about the point, he said, "It's not finished yet, so everything" and stated that he would make a statement after the entire schedule including the post season.

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, the video reveals
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, Circular Keys, Luna Park and some famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow through the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with shells, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing through the roadways into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting the waterway.
In a video released on September 27, coincidentally on the day of world tourism, Dr. Catherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most polluted estuaries of Japan.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastics per hour flow into the waterways, most of which come into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but the Sydney Harbour after that... was quite tragic," Dr. Daffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what's going on there," said Richard Nichols, the owner of the dive center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is underneath the water surface), I think everyone will be really excited.
Over half of what we discover is plastic bags.
Plastics are used at least half of the time.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and you can't believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing down the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of Ocean Protect's founders and director, said that local residents and tourists can reduce plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the amount of plastic used, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a food source.
However, we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old appearance, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, as well as the release of this video, funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of an effort to promote awareness of the environmental protection of Australians and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between 12 and 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
In the same study, parents also ranked fourth in concerns about plastic waste, and 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed said they were increasingly worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Station was demolished in October | Saga News | Saga Shimbun
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which began demolition work in October, was Futatako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) located in Futatako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
Disassembly was used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991 due to aging.
One chimney is broken down by a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
The man in his 60s, who runs a restaurant nearby, said, "When I look back from the distance and see the chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first was closed in 89 and the second was closed in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Due to the proximity of Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell goods.

This time, Mama Takahashi, a free announcer and monthly commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," spoke about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save my rotten self.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a teacher, beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I am different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important as a working person.

It has been cultivated through watching father's stage, film, television and period dramas in childhood.

At the workshop, members of the OB Group, Department of Ryukyu Performing Arts, Prefectural University of Arts, introduced the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing three lines, koto, taiko, kokyu and flute.
The host was from Miyakojima City, and Mr. Kawama Kota of the OB Association, who introduced the charm of kumidori.
In this workshop, I learned about the three components of kumidori (music, chanting, Ryukyu dance) and how five different instruments are represented in dance.
As for the three lines, it was explained that it was an element of the movement and emotional expression of the characters along with the songs, and that Kokyu was drawn up by playing the songs and the melody of the three lines.
In the latter half, the students experienced the sound of the instruments and felt the appeal of the instruments.
The aim of this initiative is to get familiar with Ryukyu classical music through musical instruments, and to get interested in "gumi Odori" by many students.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The first event in the state of Honshu in Aichi Prefecture - Yahoo!
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The FIA announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!

The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will revive in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which the International Automobile Federation (FIA) manages, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, it has been held every year to become the world's highest rallying championship with history and tradition, and it is said that the competition is the most challenging car competition because it is not only closed public roads (paved roads), but also gravel roads and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparation Committee was established to host the event in Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and Representative Director of Toyota Motor Corporation) and Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and Representative Director of Toyota Motor Corporation), both governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with relevant parties to achieve the success of the Fall 2020 Games in order to be the center of Japan's motorsports industry to appeal to the world greatly."
Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan Round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you here."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and Representative Director of Toyota Motor Corporation)
"I am very pleased to be able to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Many people, including Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Federation of Councils for Promotion of Motor Sports, commented on the Japan Round.
The WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Shirakucho) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ebisu City).
The main venue is the "Love / Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
The Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is tasmaniadeville the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmanian devils may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
This discovery is expected to create a new way to treat cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCullum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there are cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing deadly face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags used a series of proteins called PRC2 to camflage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
Peter McCullum researcher Mark Dawson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Reuse traditional therapies, revitalizing markers, or proteins known as MHC, may allow the immune system to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face tumors in Tasmanian devils, where cancer cells escape detection in the same way.
"Unsurprisingly, there will be exactly the same process (to humans and Tasmanian devils)," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may help control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-type planets orbit around small stars called red dwarfs, 30 light years from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas planet GJ3512b orbiting its main star, Red dwarf.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
In this case, however, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun's size, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, a Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, led this research published in Science, said.
The theoretical model shows that low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planets, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380°C / 3527°C).
That's why I'm doing red color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining the elliptic orbit of its Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which create a star that orbits itself.
In the most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, the object is generated from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes the atmosphere by the attraction that the egg produces.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star may have been slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature may have been lower," said Morales.
As the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant bean dip, to his colleagues
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating dips of beans with a wake-up agent to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was charged with suspected transfer of methane fetamine, a Class B felony, and taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident that occurred at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavits obtained from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane fetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach was getting worse and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have contained methane phetamine in the beans dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández "was told the victim's food that he had put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he had accidentally put methane fetamine into the beans dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows Medina Hernández pointing back to the camera and clinginging behind the microwave.
After that, it is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put a dip in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there was a customer who had been given contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was placed in Marion County Prison instead of a bail of $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gunn, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of felony by assault, robbery, supplication, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Asks can be organized" President of JR Tokai, emphasis on early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on 27th, Shin Kaneko, President of JR Tokai, reiterated his stance on early construction, stating that the problem of reducing the flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the South Alps tunnel of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen, "It is better to separate the issues that are discussed with Shizuoka Prefecture before starting construction and what should be done after starting construction."
Specifically, he kept saying, "We will talk at the meeting place and at the front stage."
President Kaneko said, "When we organize all the problems, it's hard to start, and I think it's possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "We have to talk about our thoughts."
The prefecture is concerned that the spring water that went into the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that "if there is something realistic, I think it is difficult to think about the safety side of the construction."
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the route change mentioned was "not possible."
The impact on the opening time was that Kaneko pointed out three locations: the South Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station, which took a particularly long time for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Saga News|Saga ShimbunLiVE
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required reorganisation and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced the name of the hospital on March 26.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in the country, and three are already integrated and relocated.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital in Taramachi, Fujitsu County.

In a frank conversation, the former wife looked back on how her mother and mother changed herself.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "Being a mother is like being in an advanced class to let go."
I learned as my mother that most of my work is to find myself that children want to become and to keep a reasonable distance to grow.
To find out who they are, in essence, rather than the ideal for children as parents or the admiration of their childhood.
In an interview of Good Housekeeping magazine, Mrs. Obama gave little advice to the Duchess.
sometimes you feel too much pressure from yourself and people around you.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't rush to do anything over time.

Trump Hotel owner's suitability also holds a license for sale of liquor.
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Commission has dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel, as the owner is questionable.
On Wednesday, three members, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to cancel the right to provide alcohol at the hotel is based on a state law requiring the applicant to obtain a license to sell alcohol.
In the first appeal submitted in the summer of last year, he accused Trump of assault and repeated fraud, claiming that he violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the authorization was already approved.
This was the second time an appeal was made to update the permit.
The honey collected by "Flying Bees" bees bred by Bentley is the first harvest!
How is the taste of honey collected by Flying Bees raised on the knees of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September of the same year.
More than 100 bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the factory grounds that assemble cars?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honey beets produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive officer in the manufacturing department of Bentley, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we set up a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
From the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains, the beekeepers watched how bees are gathering various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities through its Crew Plant and our business to become the top of sustainable luxury automakers, and is also part of the breeding of bees.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the harvest volume of bentra honey.
A small step leads to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to carry out various initiatives to play our own role." In May 2019, 1.2 million bees, Flying Bees, were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, the nest frame was placed on a centrifugal separator, filtered the fallen honey, and then bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The label was designed by Louise McCallum, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff, it is also a gift to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to the Fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we also want to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey in scones.
The Cleveland Police, a series of scandalous reports, said the worst in Britain.
The police, who continued the scandal, were labeled as the worst in Britain by the inspector.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
According to the Cleveland Police Department, "a serious deterioration" continues.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, efforts were made to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley of the Police Directorate said, "It has been a serious deterioration since we last investigated it."
The police chief Mike Wiel resigned in January, less than a year before his inauguration, but he was investigated for "deep" his actions, but for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal activity.
Captain Simon Herwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee of the Illegal Act for his colleagues to do sexual acts.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official confirmation that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Home Affairs intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal," and impeachment has to be settled.
No one knows what will happen.
At present, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, and it may take some time to investigate it."
"We're going to do a job that we're starting to do based on time to discover facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Wallodymil Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Giulani.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security lawyer in the Ministry of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before the formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of violations of political funds.
In response to Barr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee decided to ask who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that he thought he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the telephone talks with the President of Ukraine in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision on the treatment of this accusation.
Perosi said he was "very concerned" about the whistleblowers who became the source of information, as Trump attacked the accusers on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
I think the president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about those who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about the alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political interests and wrote a historic step.
The call was included in the accusations published on Thursdays, and the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his right to seek intervention in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from ministerial computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace Forward Christian Bentek, speed violation prohibited driving
The Premier League star, Christian Bentek, who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.

Ghana: Concerns about Cofi Manu and the composition of the Jury
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) elections.
He questioned the inclusion of Frank Davids, who expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA Sports, Mr. Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the results of the review process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The review committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside the previous interests, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kwak Parma about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if the Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after the ceremony held at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19 and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis of Corporate Governance Consultants, and Mr. Marian Barnoa of Corporate Governance Consultants and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer of Corporate Governance Consultants.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Appocavi, a sports director and lawyer.

The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including eating and drinking and staying.
"There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs," he said.
When companies responded that they could raise funds, the average salary was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
After hearing the hiring status of the company in March 2007, a total of 61.3% of regular employees were hired, 54.5% were employed, and 15.4% were employed.

A total of 86 and 4% of respondents had challenges in hiring, and in many cases, they cited "a small number of applicants" and "a low profile of the company" as "a condition that was favorable for wages."
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (department within three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There were also opinions to encourage students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% said they already recognized the sub-sector and/or business proposed in the growth strategy.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiprick said to Wales when the World Cup Tennozan and Australia meet to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Wallabeads, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will probably be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, who has played 15 games, wins 14 against Wales, Tiprick and his team will be a straight line for the best eight against England.
"It's natural, I want both teams to try and win at the top of the group, and I want to end," said Tiprick, a Welsh Franker.
We've had a tough fight against Australia, but it was good to win last fall.
Australia thinks it's going to make a lot of money back, but it's time to try and win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I'm here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Wales has won the third place since 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the total score for the 3 Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight Team was only 7 out of 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was included in several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
Certainly the game was tough, and maybe I thought that everyone could win, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be a bit narrower than actually."
In order to win Wales, the key is the breakdown battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Law.
In the past, Tiprick has played 67 international matches, and he has played several matches with both players.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When I play against the background of the World Glass, I always know that I will be in a tough game.
They are always the best in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is an aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when needed.
I want to fight against the world's best players and increase myself rather than confronting the background.
I want to fight with the best people, and if I play against them, I have to do my best.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from entertainers?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by the black sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said in a press conference on July 22 that "the company has no talent at 9 and there is no such thing at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
As for the ratio of "9:1" to "9:1," if Yoshimoto had 90 percent, it was considered that there was a gift from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and investors who were taxing were also tweeted on Twitter.
If Galla's share was "9:1," would there be a gift tax?
i heard from you.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If "9:1" is the amount of work for 1 million yen, the profit of 1 million yen in sales and 10 million yen in expenses will be 90 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you are wondering about distribution, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) away from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, it is not possible for a third party to decide on how much tax-appropriate price is for what both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think it is a poison to pay for one yen.

the white house, the impeachment's foothold, panic.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and detailed officials in this issue explained that they felt a "great panic" this week against the lack of plans to deal with the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be increasing "confidents, anxiety, and concerns" about the possibility that the appeal of the whistleblowers would damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't really know what it is."
The White House officials joked that there was no clear plan for this situation, or that this claim was so serious that the normal measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied.
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's unfavorable response to the impeachment was likely to be "indefinite."
Another source of concern is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the President is expected to be raised every day, and some of the close advisers of the President are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has taken increasingly unpredictable actions and spurred concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about the President and politics in the election year.
Trump faced the greatest threat ever before in his term of office, and reviving his strategy that he judged effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Moller, he has become an attacker and has changed his hands.
Trump tried to lighten the request of the President of Ukraine to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for partisan conflict.
However, many White House officials have endured the trials of the Mora investigation, but this time they are beginning to feel the difference.
The President, whose powers are branded, seemed to be coming to the press conference on Wednesday, said a detailed person in this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that the damage can be mitigated, claiming it is a fact that they undermine the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information on the calls with President Trump, Vladimir Zerensky, and Ukrainian Presidents, which are controversial.
Furthermore, it often happens when the President is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic family close to the White House points out that the basic support of the President is already very high and that the impeachment will not have much effect on gaining new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with legislative proposals and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those claiming impeachment could help the President did not fully understand how uncertain the response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to the officials who explained the plan, this initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented and what kind of actions will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations activities in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum that the publication and publication of critical internal accusations had given the Democratic impeachment.
The lack of a long-term strategic perspective is clearly visible, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munshin stated that they would not publish notes on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later.
According to a person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called Trump's external pitbull and Corrie Luwandouski, who served as the head of the former Electoral Countermeasures Headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the President and the policy for the past five years, but we haven't talked to the President or his close adviser about joining a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Morler investigation, left the White House legal adviser Pat Ciporon with less experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy is generally aware that stakeholders are far from recruiting human resources and building strategic teams, but that they need human resources to be organized and able to lead the collective efforts and political struggle.

The success rate is only 16% Tomoyoshi Morikawa - Yahoo! News
9/6 (Fri) 13:51
I was able to have a boyfriend, but because of his work, I had a long distance romance ...
I was told to marry one day, but I couldn't see the goal. ...
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation with our allies to marriage?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice derived from detailed data analysis is essential.
what's this?
I am worried whether I should continue dating my boyfriend in a long distance romance.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I have work and my family, but his place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from a distance love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editor C is in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "the distance is tested and the two become stronger."
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa: Speaking of distance love, a survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by seeing the other person (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touch sensation), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to an opponent's house, you will be burdened with the time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if you are on a holiday to heal the tiredness of your work, your body is a kata.
I feel refreshed when I go home.
Isn't it necessary to break apart when it comes to distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently, or if you are a couple who have decided to stay away in advance.
If you're engaged a year later, or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you don't see a future landing point.

Debbie Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
Thursday, in a comment to defend the President, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive of the House Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had asked for a Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son to investigate.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the full naked picture of the President, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the leftists and their media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians to obtain Trump's nude photos."
It would be natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the President within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes, Huffpost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine if the Democrats were looking for the truth.
He was the only member of the House of Representatives Jim Heims of the Connecticut Democratic Party to answer so far, but many other members questioned whether the answer was a naked truth.
Mediate Dotcom speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that are said to have been written in steel documents that are controversial.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected in Trump watching prostitutes urination in a hotel in Moscow.

potential reduction of exhaust gas in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only aircraft to fly in the sky and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology to make renewable biofuels available as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as fats, livestock rendering, and canola oil from restaurants.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality fats to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude oil-based fuels, and other industrial wastes can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said that the technology achieved in the first generation was hydrocarbons of molecules in diesel gasoline itself.
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technologies tend to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is something like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that have already been partially developed to maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try it in a reactor to change the chemical reaction a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and U.S. Army investing in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare a substitute for the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center, which recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a 25 million US production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler says that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher for fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decision given.

Boris Johnson's camp warned that Britain would face riots like Los Angeles if Brexit was overturned.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a risk that "a violent riot by the people" would occur in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots of 1992.
Johnson stated that he "neared" the political words exchanged with intense rhetoric, but insisted that he would not use the term "defeat."
Despite the fact that the prime minister appealed to the Times to regain his calmness, one minister said: "In this country, there has never been a kind of riot in Los Angeles in 1992.
People do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best exercise - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to a verdict of innocence.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government protesters wearing eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, it would be dangerous for "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a House of Representatives rebellion, which calls for lower demands on withdrawal from the EU and instead calls for a compromise to hit the EU.

pakistan, brother of social media celebrity, life sentence for honor murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the incident fades.
"It's too long, so people forget," said the women's rights activist Farzana Bali, Pakistan's first gender college founder, and added that even the Burrought case, which has attracted attention, took more than three years to solve.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "elebrated murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much more than that, because it is estimated that approximately one fifth of the 5,000 honor killings that are committed by honor-based violence monitoring organizations worldwide every year are occupied by Pakistan.
Countermeasures against pork cholera 1.3 billion yen To add to the September compensation plan in Shizuoka Prefecture (Magyo Shimbun) - Yahoo! News

flood and chaos caused by prolonged monsoons india
The monsoon season in India is about a month long, the building collapses with unprecedented rainfall, killings, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month is usually 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, the monsoon will weaken in the most late decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays caused the building to collapse and some people died.
The houses are flooded, and the inhabitants walk through the streets with water on their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Laknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In the northern part of Uttalakand, heavy rains caused damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
A prolonged monsoon is not desirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon at this time.
Prakash Mecherer, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarakand, said, "Now we're making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but they're going to rot by rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak Monsoon.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pens) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees (about 1 pound).
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dašera on 8 October, where the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, who is the evil smiling figure of the beard-boom appearing in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, it may be Lavana to laugh at the end.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
Recent studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may lead to increased risk of heart disease.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this study is the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Cakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women or other races because it only targets Japanese Americans.
Since pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the biggest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year follow-up survey, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez told the press.
This is probably due to the increased importance of other factors related to aging, which hides the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone meeting
The impeachment procedure for U.S. President Donald Trump was a dramatic week on Washington political issues.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political novice Vladimir Zerensky.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump phone problem?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had a lot of convenience in Ukraine from other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's objection of 100% rather than 10% is considered controversial.
Zerensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially opposition parties in Ukraine, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the support, including the sanctions and economic aid of the EU during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Voytica, said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then professsed military aid and asked Zerensky to investigate two rather than one, one for Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the other for the server of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail fraud during the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone.
Thanks to the announcement of the call, I would like to thank the people who helped me."
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana by provisionally obtaining an effective implementation rate of 89.89%, and to the Air Safety Director for the highest score in Africa.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Air Force's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was recognized by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO on safety at airports and national airspace.
These awards were created as part of the support of ICAO's delayed national zero campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluations and 17 certifications for safety evaluations were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was awarded to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aikoi Otou to Canada, and Director of Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Benad Aliu, stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to continue to realize that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also said that the award is a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's inflexibility and perseverance.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a tremendous potential to develop the domestic economy as "airs are likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

In the middle of the mountain, Yamato OTA, who had left his left arm, threw two games and showed his ability to break through the hardships in the necessary place.
There is also a two-point gap between the two sides of the game, which is very difficult to overcome.
The fight between the two teams takes place.
The final and third round will be held at the same venue on 29 October, and the top three schools will be eligible to participate in the Tohoku tournament held in Iwate Prefecture in October.

Trump and Peter Gino are appointed as FEMA Chiefs: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA budget bill at the National Security Senate Committee held at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Secretary of FEMA, was the deputy director of government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been absent from the Senate since March, when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, decided that Mr. Long had illegally used government-owned vehicles to commute to work between Washington and his home, Norcarorina, and he resigned.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baiard, brought up suspicions that he was drunk and involved in a riot, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of this month after consideration.
Mr. Gayno's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he was on duty at the Emergency Management Authority in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of Butanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found at an office building on 9600 blocks on Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators also found equipment packed with beep cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," said Captain Kano.
Capt. Cano said he had previously been involved in drug investigations and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used in the Bayp product.
"Only static electricity from clothing can fire, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," says Lieutenant Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions and fires one after another.
The Dangerous Processing Unit was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigators said that they received some anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activity.
The investigators are still in pursuit of who is the black curtain of illegal Beip activities.
The police said that because the office was empty, Zhang himself thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police said they would like to receive recent news, especially about the dangers of bating, and to avoid getting out of the illegal bating products.
"I don't know whether it's real or not."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a huge earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6!
Evacuation training in Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
A practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held every year.
On the stage, a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department is performed, and it is assumed that there will be a 6-strong earthquake in the middle of the song.
About 300 people attended the training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents and hall staff.

The lost dress of Elizabeth I, exhibited at Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver foil yarn, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, animals and butterflies was fluffy.
Ellie Lin, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, has decided to be one.
Lin saw this fading piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in one country, which was placed there 100 years ago, and is considered part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this luxurious cloth, which was used as the altarpiece of the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly that room where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one more dress left in the 16th century shows that it was an important discovery throughout the Royal Dress Collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of the sleeves to the dress, three years of research have raised the conviction of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
One of the most expensive textiles of the royal family was the silver thread cloth, which was prepared by law only by the senior members of the royal family, but the embroidery of plants and flowers of the "name" quality also suggests that the patterns of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later were noble persons.
It is believed that the dress was equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions when it was built.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen would be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or would not be tolerated by rivals wearing such luxurious clothing.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
I was always happy to hear that the cloth was amazing, and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one of the dresses that were cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton is not as expected.
Bactton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and the local legend says that the cloth has long been associated with Parry.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley before Elizabeth died in 1603.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on very delicate sewing, will be displayed next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and the work was led by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with the historic fabric, you're really impressed by the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the back and on the back, you will find a great respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched" A week after the missing girls, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew The volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after a girl in the first grade of elementary school disappeared at a campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk, such as mountain slopes and Sawa.
Also, on the 27th, I couldn't understand the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search.
The police and fire departments are planning to continue searching from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
As a result of the appeal, the Plaintiffs sued for election invalidation because the value of one vote is 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member is the lowest in the country in July.
In the first oral argument held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendant's side called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It is not that there was a significant inequality in the extent that there was a problem of constitutionality.
The judgment is passed on October 30.

Arriving at the Space Station | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
"Konotori" No. 8, a drone that arrived at the International Space Station.
The robot arm of the station is growing from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori 8 and applauded JAXA staff on 28th (JAXA provided)
On the night of 28th, the unmanned spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA) carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), which is about 400 kilometers high, arrived near the station, and astronauts during their stay operated the robotic arm.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the difference in speed and approaches about 10 meters away.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters in length is the flow that grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After installing it on the station, the flight attendants carry the luggage.
he's involved in one third of the american drugs
Chicago Immediately after the sunrise of Chicago Westside, CBS News caught a rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose.
McNight said that 90% of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named Nemecio Servantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Chief investigator Matthew Donahew DEA in Mexico said, "Mencho is DEA and, indeed, one of the top priorities of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
The prize money raised by El Mencho reached $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were rampant.
El Mencho's drug cartels, Harrisco Nueva, are involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel has sold "massive" cocaine, methane phenyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobility unit.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho dies without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders have been caused by drug cartels.
According to statistics from the Mexican government, about 94 murders occur a day.
In Chicago, the confiscated Mexican narcotics are toxic and must be used in protective clothing during treatment.
At the manufacturing site, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the solder.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively take away the lives of innocent women and children.
In other words, when someone's child dies, Donahew said that it is "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the past
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to Last of As.
Some of the video footage of this new action game was also presented to fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
Since the PS1 era, the Last of As Part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Notydog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"The story is magnificent and complicated in a different way than the previous one," said Dracman.
And it was necessary to tell stories that had so many characters.
I didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but it eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all the other sections started."
The game was so spectacular that it did not enter a single Blu-ray, and it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it doesn't want to ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic Notic Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
MLB The Show 19 will be released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like Last of As Remastered and want to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including a popular character Ellie's backpack and bracelet replica and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima mobile sales "help" council attempts Residents hope to continue (Kokukoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, the Notoshima Regional Development Council (Notoshima Regional Development Council) was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings and foods crossed the Susomachi-kai and Hanpo-cho-kai on the first day.
There were also products that were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents were asked to continue "help" "Choose goods is fun."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, a total of vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiragobo, which are divided into packs, were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Suso Machi-kai, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akira Kikuchi, a member of the council, showed a surprising expression: "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Ms. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I don't know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
The user also ordered "I don't want can coffee, but I want coffee to be dripped by myself."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is currently only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to buy and sell items to save "shopping weak."
By December, the 20 town councils on the island will be held once a month.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to provide additional assistance of about $1 billion to drought-stricken residents.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by droughts have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been significantly revised to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million is recorded as a drought-affected resident support organization, and the target farmers receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to $100 million of drought relief funds for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted more than $7 billion for drought relief.
Ronald Lee Haskel: The murder of a former wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen, Katie Stay, and four of his five children.
The authorities said on July 9, 2014 that Haskell was forced into his residence and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent, but she had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired and announced that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old son, 9 and 7 years old daughter died.
Only one person in his family, Cassidy Stie, was 15 years old at the time, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed from the charges until Monday.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of the girl who shook her anger resonated with the leaders of each country.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread school strikes around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and frustration were protesting all over the world, including Japan.
About 4 million people attended in more than 150 countries.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will start in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the latter half of the century, and to reduce the temperature rise from before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to 1/5.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, has been pointed out to be related to global warming in various places.
In order to achieve a faster pace of global warming, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit held by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations, which strengthened the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not shown any new targets, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become conspicuous.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years" is large.
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at an environmental meeting, said in a press conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wound that cannot be discussed will not be the same as the "replacement of issues" that the person himself counters.
There is no longer a grace to cope with global warming, and the international community has to deal with the common crisis of humanity.
We can't expect the effectiveness of each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
In order to avoid taking away that future, adults should act.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The research results of the U.S. Army led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and time-keeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute Distributed Quantum Information Center, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state and one is measured, even if one quantum bit is physically far from the other, the measurement results are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to be composed of a network between physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite a large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing large-scale distributed entangling," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains enough quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured in ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions and excited them to release photons stored in quantum information at the same time.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit the photon with a fiber optic cable.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
The team then sent the light particles through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nm, the optimal value of long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50 km long optical fiber cable.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured simultaneously with high-quality "clock" quantum bits, which leads to the realization of an entangled network of long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate position measurement, navigation, and time-keeping applications."
