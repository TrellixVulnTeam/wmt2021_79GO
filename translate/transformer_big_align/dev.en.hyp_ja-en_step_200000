Croatia is planning nuclear treatment facilities, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina to protest the Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators in the town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the barracks in Trugovska Gola, and vow to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take away a healthy future" and "We need a hard stop" said nuclear waste disposal facilities could threaten the lives of about 250,000 residents in the Una and surrounding areas.
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grad, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities next week.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or to pay the cost of the waste of Croatia that Slovenia would be treated at newly constructed facilities.
Croatian Minister of Environmental Protection and Energy Tomislav Chorich told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, hoping to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials, and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would seek another construction site on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket be the best place in Croatia?"
Don't let us hurt ourselves!

So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following as a precaution.
While the child is healthy, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner if he is ill.

The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Excessively administering drugs and other drugs causes disease symptoms.
How general is Münchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.

Nigeria: police force investigation into caduna schools, rescue 300 children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday in a forced investigation into the Imam Ahmed Bun Hanbar school in Rain Maidbun Tsunma, Igabi.
Police said that the children were placed in an inhumane environment, but the school denied this claim.
The school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
Parents came to deliver their children's meals every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were in.
I was so surprised that the police came and evacuated the kids, and after all the food the parents delivered, they closed the school.
Even though there are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, this is an unfair treatment."
He adds that Abdullahman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Savo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhumane environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Central Coast's "super villainous" girl rape, court order against the victim.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending school in Central Coast, Kentucky.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to trees and assaulted her.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges of assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking along the path and witnessed a man armed with a large tree branch and a knife coming out of the bush suddenly.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, don't stop."
The man said to the girl, "Don't speak loud.
When I hear it, I can't see it."
The man had a cutlery on his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with cable tie, and hit the tree for nearly an hour.
When a man broke the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., without responding to several phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood on his clothes with mud, grass, and trees, and he was involved in street violence and was chasing the driver to the bush, and he insisted that he had fallen by his hand.
The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development warns IT representatives of public benefit.
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors on Friday that if there was no moral assessment of public interest, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
In the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and responses by social media companies during the atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profit, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
The Pope warned, "If technological progress could cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it would not be the right true progress."
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will go back to a kind of savage based on the theory of strong people.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to use the expertise of the participants to find the people who can become future advisors of the Catholic Church on the high-tech field.

Fan excitement with Real Madrid loaner Martin Wooden Goal and uplifter.
Martin Woodegor showed a surprise support for Michel Oyalusabal.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, breaking the record in the domestic season and turning to the top of La Liga.
However, this season, despite not losing one game in La Liga, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, the pressure seemed to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves, was surprised by Michel Oyalusabal's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, was a dribbling opponent's crotch and sent an exquisite pass through the inside of another two players to Oyalu Sabal, where he was given the perfect slew ball.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third goal of the stunning Oyalusabal penalty spot, Alabeth's midfielder Manu Garcia secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before the end of the season.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but struggled to demonstrate his reputation.
The Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally achieved this position.
Anna Hazare and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When we contacted this lawsuit, Sharad Powerle's name was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazare was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Office (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Ajit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the Central Authority.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Agit Powerl and former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit came, the name of Sharad Powerl was nowhere.
An executive lawsuit and alleged that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazare said on Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name appeared or who mentioned it."
Anna Hazare, critic of Sharad Powerl, expressed his expectation that the truth would be revealed if the executive conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud.
Anna Hazare, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this incident."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the joint bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the October 21 elections in Maharashtra.
The former coalition minister clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that he would not surrender before the "kingdom" of Delhi.
The NCP referred to the action by the Executive Bureau as a political abbreviation.

Stop the mistake of stepping on the accelerator pedal!
Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by miscarriage.
The number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistake by elderly drivers has been on an increasing trend.
In particular, when it comes to a sudden start, it becomes panic and the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
There are new vehicles equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such a driver's mistake but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended vehicles.
After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] The "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform the pedal mistake from a new perspective.
It is to avoid the pedal mistake with "an alarm sound."
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping, the acceleration is avoided.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf.
It is attached to the OBDII connector, and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is easy to set up.
[Ashimo Watching kun] The world wing launched its launch in mid-September, and the Ashimo Watching kun is an accelerator and brake step prevention device.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is stepped suddenly, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the rapid advance.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantly control the start-up by turning it into a creep running state (where the brake is removed in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of about 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The installation is only possible with caplaron and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Ms. Saori Kusumoto (32) of Kitamachi, Takeo City said that a three-year-old child who liked nursery school suddenly disappeared after a flood and was forced to go to the nursery school at night.
"I didn't have enough time to clean up my house," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can't panic and say "It's okay."
Yukari Ogushi (36) of Shiraishi Town spent a night at the evacuation shelter town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
He said, "If there is a child who can't stay still, I will use my mind around him."
The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the event of a disaster with food and simple toilets.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinako Kawasaki (40), a 6-year-old and 8-year-old child in Shiraishi-cho, said, "In elementary school, there was an e-mail on the day before, but there was no communication network or email system for nursery schools.
There was also a request to build a system that could share the flooded road in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I don't know what it was like last time."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
President Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as an organization."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Arcuri has been questioned by the police authorities.
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandals in London mayor's office in violation of criminal law.
The Greater London Administration (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts concerning acts" on suspicion that Mr. Curi had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists in the presence of information that indicates that a crime may have been committed," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations made by the English and Welsh police.
The issue was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to that of the Police Chief.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson said he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information about his relationship with Arcuri, although he claimed it was "constitutional."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but reports suggest that U.S. citizens who had moved to London seven years ago were paid £126,000 from public money at the time of the Mayor of London, and that Johnson and others were given preferential treatment to participate in three foreign trade dispatches.
Since then, the government has frozen a £100,000 grant to Hacker House, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked questions puzzled about the survey process before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper assessment" and that the company owns the British phone number.
However, according to a number of reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Curi (34) is currently based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among the staff."
The move of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"In any case, the supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence, and the Prime Minister has not given the opportunity to answer to the supervisory authority before the news reports issued late Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will see the political kyogen that was created by the people.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessman, supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division, was "public secret."
The former London & Partners (L&P) staff stated that although there were people who believed that the company was "untrustworthy" at that time, they had the privilege of attending trade-related talks abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
This is the 20th anniversary of Yahoo!
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Sawakami Tsushin, about the future prospects.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the 20 years history.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the people involved, not to the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit remained unchanged for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from anxiety about money, the world will become brighter from the foundation, and we are working hard to do our daily work together.
In the long term, operations are not graded unless you walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes with a lot of money.
I feel that we have been familiar with the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result is a 20-year long-term long-term fund and we believe it is because we continue to be a direct sales system that can deliver messages directly to many people.
At the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, amount and cost.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc. miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - A third man was arrested and charged for drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had previously held before he had accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol, and fenthanyl, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that is plagued by thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Pettyt as Walter's "deliver."
Neither of the three were directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there were still arguments against each case.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutors in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the start of the trial due to the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate reply to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke out in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video to his Instagram and released a song called "Suncue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died of overdose of drugs in 2016, and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
These nine-year-olds are using a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hidden game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime and stories on and off-line.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
The player gets points when they catch a bat out of the hiding place.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN, "I spend my time making games when I'm bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil the opportunity to experience new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in numerous mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
At the age of seven, however, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a bit angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but how about making games myself so that others can play it?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care about it."
Since then, Basil, who has been interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to be a scientist in the future, has the name of his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The African youth population is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is made, young people like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded a robot that uses program code to divide housework.
In May, Akrobo won the 2019 Robofest Contest, a women's high school team from Ghana who programmed boxed robots.
African investment in Google and Microsoft giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil-chan and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely accused federal agents of corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' attorney, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which charges Hayes deems.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor accused Hayes of being involved in a plan for a senior insurance company to fund the state's insurance director's election.
Major Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cozy.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated over $5 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindbergh supported Republican principles and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked for a comment by e-mail on Friday, but did not respond.
On Friday, Hayes' Defendant, Carns Davis, also requested an additional comment by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken with Corsey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutor said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Corsey, and had a direct bribe with the director.
The indictment published in April claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to hold up to $2 million in his campaign to re-election in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for the replacement of officials who had been examining Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no doubts.
Indictment is described in a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cozy that Lindbergh's co-owner instructed Hayes to send $50,000 to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would draw attention if he had moved so much money, but he eventually broke up in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an email asking for further information on judicial transactions, but no reply.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like to post others!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and can only be seen by posters.
The new Facebook attempt will start on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Michael Garrick, Head of Policy at Facebook Australia, said the change was based on feedback from mental health professionals who would consider the number of goodies and social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had very positive feedback from many bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
It is only to remove numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange rather than the number of good! or reaction.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
It is very early to test in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, and other countries.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when this test will end or change.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experience, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has very aggressive "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram users.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder Part (ring type) " (Lettuce Club News) - Yahoo!
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag and I couldn't move anywhere.
If my favorite bag fittings are broken, I want to repair them somehow and continue to use them.
It was a part of Cando's handicrafts that helped me.
when i gave up saying, don't sell anymore.
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pra product.
Therefore, if you ask the shop for repairs, the price of the main unit was significantly higher.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this connected fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, everything is silver color.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was moved when I discovered it in the handicraft corner.
that's 100 percent.
Originally it is a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one on both ends of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you line it up with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is very attached.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The number of fittings increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight is no problem.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts has increased and the design level has improved.
Aso, the express train of the JNR, is a temporary train, Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train with the image of the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
On the same day, about 240 people, including railway fans, boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station to Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, Japanese travel was organized.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo, Chikuho and Kagoshima lines.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother was sentenced to life in the honor of kandeal burochi, a Pakistani social media star.
Candy Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of his sister's murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment with the "principal murder" that attracted the most attention of his patriarchal Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by Baroch, who is famous for being provocative in Pakistan, which is very strong in women's disparities, although it is not large in Western standards.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
He said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, "Of course" and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar (God's calling) will be innocent in the Supreme Court," he said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that he wanted his son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Baroch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of misrepresenting the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the so-called "principal murder."
Women have been burned down, killed, stabbed or strangled by crimes such as choosing their own marriage partner, commending their sexuality and exposing their family to shame.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisers and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow perpetrators to be forgiven from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honor killing.
However, whether the murder is an honorable crime is left to the discretion of the judge, and the murderer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted not give him forgiveness.
However, his parents changed their minds and asked him to forgive him.
In response to international hatred for murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Baroch's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a bright red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
It became critical and threatening, but it was recognized by many people, including young people, that it opened up new heavens and earth in a country considered to be a bold political activity to express oneself as a presence like Kim Kardashian.
The origins of the "priority" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, especially in women's behavior, although men may be victims.

(From left) ASA Amami Sports Academy
【Okinagarabe General Bureau】ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda, Amami City) and Okinagara Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda, China Town) signed a partnership to support the promotion of remote island sports on July 25.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects implemented by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish mutual support systems in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both groups mediate, dispatch, and share information when training related to sports.
When a team of remote islands participates in an expedition outside the island, they work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association with the ASA, in the event of a tournament on the mainland, such as a prefectural tournament, we will support the athletes to prevent their performance from falling due to fatigue on a boat trip or staying overnight.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players who came from outside the island by cooperating with local registries and hospital officials.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Elabco in China-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.
After that, both organizations co-hosted a training session with Athletic Trainer Yuichiro Hidaka.
Local sports boys and club leaders and parents learned how to use taping properly and how to prevent injuries.
Mr. Sonoda (52) said, "The purpose of the activities to eliminate the handicap of remote islands in terms of the sports environment is common to each other, and there are many areas that can cooperate.
Mr. Maeda (43) said, "It is very encouraging to have a partnership with a proven organization like ASA, and I would like to absorb good things to improve the sports environment for children in remote islands."
Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking about Mote twice.
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko stick to the traditional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and mote man.
if you're stuck in it, you'll be able to live.
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and behavior of people.
When we learn patterns, the brain systemizes behavior by doing this better, so I think we will be able to live happily.
I think I am still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I am "mote."
That's why living is so wonderful.
I taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit tough if you're stuck in the old pattern of "a university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so I enjoy it every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will survive.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
In my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is, I talked like that.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that naturally emerge around him.
It's not that easy.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by the "thinkness" you cannot be light.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of their position or age, it seems that "beautiful" is an excuse and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to say what this "cute" is.
what is it?
In the northwestern part of Nigeria, illegally doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 due to intensified violence over the past four months.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created, and by the end of this year, new funding activities for $35.5 million will be needed.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that the Islamic extremist Boko Haram, who has been active in anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Sokot, Zamfara and Kazina in Nigeria over the past ten months was caused by organized armed groups.
"The fear of illegal and unstable conditions is well represented," Barrok told reporters on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, vandalism, murder and sexual violence were frequently occurring, and that the raiders destroyed houses and worked for theft.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the area.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Boko Haram and the West African branch of Islamic State, which was split in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," Barrok says.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
The UNHCR stated in a statement that the security situation in Sokot, especially, was deteriorating, and the number of refugees crossing Niger was expected to increase in the coming months.
the new trial date for a man who killed two women and two children is confirmed.
The guatemara men's trial date was confirmed to have killed two women and two children in Iowa.
According to Polk County Court records, Marvin Escobar Ollyana (31) was prosecuted for the first-class murder in three cases, the false name Marvin Eskibel Lopez, who had been named to the police at the beginning of the official recognition.
He pleaded guilty.
According to the police, on 16 July, in Demoyne's house, he shot Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and her son (5).
The court records that the date of the trial will be decided on 27 January, giving the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare.
According to officials of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Bureau, Escobar Ollyana was illegally staying in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.
Sonet Media Networks (SMN) has started advertising on header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their needs.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system in which multiple bidders (advertisers) and fair bid competition can prioritize high-priced ads to media operated by media companies.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
In the past, SSP has been providing advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to a particular ad frame that has a high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase ad frame that meets the needs of advertisers.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP is expanded.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP header bids enable them to participate in direct header bids and increase the delivery opportunities for ads.
In addition, because the target media company is limited, the advertising frame of the delivery destination along with individual commercial materials and brand images is secured, preventing brand value damage.
One of the advantages of media companies is that it is possible to implement initiatives in accordance with the expectations of the introduction of media companies by using a solution that manages the code of the bidder companies called " wrapper solutions" that LFP promotes collaboration.

Two-month suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On July 27, Yamagata University announced that an assistant professor in his 30s at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Assistant Professors of the Department of Internal Affairs and Communications, from around October 2017 when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, were emotionally motivated and abused in inappropriate words, which gave him strong mental stress.
He was a teacher of education and was recognized as having worsened the learning environment.
A survey conducted in September 18 addressed several students.
The management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and from December of the same year, an investigation was conducted at the Harasssment Prevention Committee by faculty members of Yonezawa Campus.
Based on the findings from the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
After the survey, the assistant professor continued to teach, but through the interview, his actions were improved and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama said, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to the victims and other stakeholders, and will work to prevent harassment and to restore confidence."
The university also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students led by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts Boris Johnson demands a compromise with the EU to reduce EU withdrawal demands.
Now that only three weeks have passed since the EU summit, there has been growing concerns surrounding the Prime Minister that the prime minister may have been out of time to withdraw significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of withdrawal from the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations over a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are tight, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel will propose a compromise proposal on the ground floor, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the senior advisor Dominique Camings, and insist that the EU will accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One cabinet member said that the Supreme Court's ruling that the closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday would be "an alarm."
We will never win in the House of Representatives, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use what is available from his steps.
It is not effective even if it becomes radical, and Cammings' plans are clearly unsuccessful.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to implement the previous Prime Minister's proposal, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many things that everyone is trying to end.
If we postpone it, Boris will end and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer accused Boris of not seriously considering negotiations.
In a harsh speech, the former leader of the Conservative Party said, "The Prime Minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Whales, and discussing with the people on the streets - as if the election campaign was full-fledged."
The prime minister's press yesterday acknowledged that the agreement was still a long way ahead, and said, "If anyone can't make a difference, the road is still long."
However, the press also said that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month re postponement, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill has hampered our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to keep moving forward despite the legislation has been enacted."
Stephen Barclay, Minister of Departure of the European Union, returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
They discuss how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorain Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
In his Glasgow accent, Lorraine Kelly was told by television bosses that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, 59 years old, said he was very nervous.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorain.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, she will broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
He said that passion and enthusiasm and curiosity were the secret to survival in the television industry, and added, "You have to put it into work."
To be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Danbrane shooting incident was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think many of the families of children who were killed or injured were watching us live broadcast the show from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, who was killed by her mother and five-year-old daughter Joanna, personally wants to see me, so we talked for hours at her house.
I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and that "we really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking net of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of the presidency from former President Robert Mugabe, who was in the midst of a coup, due to fears that it might be a trap for the military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, the failure of Chiwenga's offer was not due to anxiety, but because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of his government in a coup.
According to Jamwanda2's Twitter account, officials confirmed that he was a high-ranking official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munangawa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was made by three.
President Spokesman George Charanba, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, Aaron Nepera, and Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Muconoli, were involved in negotiations and officials said.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Defense Forces of Zimbabwe.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to denounce military action by the African Union, seeking intervention by African leaders.
The offer to cede the president to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was a wasteful act to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there were some political aims of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If there was anything to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I hope that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and destroy the claims of the commanders claiming that he did not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had been unable to determine whether it would be a coup without fully grasping the entire situation, would eventually be called a coup and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that they would not turn guns to the citizens, even if they had invaded the presidential residence called the Blue Roof.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
The words "Is Tiri Bemaqwapa Macwapa" (which we belong to the camouflage group) were used in the words of an envoy (gono) telling the president's desperate message, and a powerful metaphorical expression "We are not a politician nor are we in political competition."
The Army told the local commanders that through the military officers who stayed in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munnagagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at the time, South Africans, who were key to this process, refused to intervene, but were repeatedly threatened behind it, making it clear that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources tell the Independent.
The second atomic bomb at the United Nations appeals to the ban on nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and Ms. Michiko Takeuchi (63), the granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, spoke to support the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
Five new countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, including 32 countries and regions.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were made in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total elimination of nuclear weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern over recent years that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is no other way to abolish it."
China needs strong leadership.
Prior to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complex, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will lead to division and collapse and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the repression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who will play the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he took power in late 2012.
Xi also oversaw the modernization of military forces threatening the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development models, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but rather merely seek peace.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the bully, and war and chaos left a deep scar with that pain; China would never take the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never abandon its core interests, nor allow security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"There is no problem with the threat of trade war and the rising tariff," White Paper states.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"We will never weaken the trade war."
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities, and opening a new world.
Since China has no idea of countering the United States and does not want to replace the United States, the United States should calmly capture the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is less likely to stop China's development.
The U.S. would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko.
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as the coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local newspaper had an appeal to the baseball team.
After hearing the situation from two students, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the interviews with 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they were dismissed on 28 January, because they generally accepted the facts.
In the summer of 15th, Motochika WATANABE (74), who raised pitchers such as Daisuke MATSUSAKA (present-day Nakanichi), left Yokohama.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
In the summer of the 16th century, he participated in the Koshien Garden in the summer for three consecutive years.
However, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals this summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in the autumn, and the Senbatsu tournament in the next spring was desperate.
Spice Girls' merc, eating disorders, and eating disorders are prohibited in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, from his experience of eating nothing but fruit and vegetables for many years, admitted that diet was banned at home.
Sporty spices have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders after years of "excessive exercise" without eating well under pressure from members of the global pop group.
Chizom told her that her experience was influenced by her daughter Scarlett's child-rearing and that "every topic about diet in her home is prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his own appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking to my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, a "bad" comment on himself in the media led to physical problems, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I took out certain food groups, I became obsessed with exercise more and more, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Judiciary judgment on same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch judged that this was a case in which 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage was established between the same sex.
More than 20 countries accept same-sex marriages, and local governments such as Sapporo City, which have no legal effect in the country, have a system to certify same-sex partnerships.
The court ruled that the two women were actually married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to allow same-sex couples to have legal protection.
The same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Registration Law.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system to recognize diverse families.
Women lived together for about seven years and received a marriage certificate in the United States.
The court ruled that "the reality of marriage between men and women is no different" due to the fact that the two lived together.
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of married couples with the right to marry in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that defines marriage as "only based on the mutual agreement."
Both sexes were considered "unpresumably same-sex marriages were not expected at the time of establishment, so the purpose of denying same-sex marriage is not understood."
While the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits across the country.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, the problem remained that the amount of compensation was reduced, as "the benefits of legal protection differ from those of men and women."
It is unlikely that the difference in the right to protect, while recognizing the same reality as that of men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, 70% of people considered same-sex marriage to be legally recognized have changed their consciousness.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" admitted by law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in the tax system and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriages between same-sex couples, but also the expansion of legal rights for actual marriage.
to the trial and jury of former athletes indicted for rape of multiple women.
A jury trial was held in the trial of former Delaware University baseball players accused of sexual assault on multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's life luck.
A 21-year-old woman tells her that she was sexually assaulted after sending Conaway home by car.
The two met after three weeks of meeting at Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault the woman.
The defenses have argued that women's contradictions and differences in memory may have regretted having physical relations.

In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final game of this season and the possibility of his own entry into CS failed.
If the player wins all three games, they will be eliminated.
At the ceremony after the match, Koichi Ogata (50) apologized, "I'm sorry that I couldn't win the final game, and I couldn't confirm my position."
He was taken by some fans.
In addition, at the end of his greeting, he said, "I will do my best to rob Penant next season."
However, after the ceremony, when asked by the press about the point, he said, "It's not finished yet, so it's all."
【Dospo】Oda is the 4th and 20th most self-executive after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
It became a reward for the seniors.

the serious pollution of popular tourist destinations
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, Circler Keys, Luna Park and some famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow through the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with suckers, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all of which are inundated by rainwater flowing through the road surface.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting waterways.
Dr. Katherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most polluted estuaries of Japan.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastics per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow through the rainwater drain into Sydney Harbour.
"The heavy rains were falling several times, but Sydney Harbour was quite tragic."
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seafloor.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what's going on there," said Richard Nichols, owner of the dive center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what's under the water surface), I think everyone looks really cool.
It is overwhelming, but more than half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The remaining half of the plastic is used somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and wastes are flowing down the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said that local residents and tourists can reduce plastics and waste flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a source of food.
However, we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing people.
A new study on plastic and mental health was also presented this month, as well as the release of the video funded by TOMRA, a recycling company, as part of an effort to make Australian citizens aware of environmental protection and the reduction of the effects of beverage containers remaining in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children aged 12 to 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also stated that 93 per cent of 551 parents, who were ranked fourth in concerns about plastic waste, were increasingly concerned about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to anxiety.
Former Karatsu Power Station was demolished in October | Saga News | Saga Newspapers
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which started demolition work in October, is Futako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Plant (oil-fired power plant) in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantling of the two cars was used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
One chimney is broken down by a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
There was a sad voice, and a man in his 60s who ran a restaurant nearby said, "When I look back from the far away and see the chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Plant began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the eastern part of Karatsu Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Due to the proximity of Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

This time, Mama Takahashi, a free announcer and monthly commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," spoke about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save me rotten.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a master beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I am different from what I am doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry and what is important to me as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was struck by being said to be "cone" or "bsaik," my father said, "I thought it was "cone, but it wasn't."
After that, when I joined the company in the second or third year, when I was only working "Anyone with an empty woman can do it," and when I didn't get motivated because I didn't want to do the job I wanted to do, even when my heart was rotting, "Who can do the work is hard to do.If so,"I asked Mama, but I was glad to be in charge.
i learned naturally from my father's acting.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading news, but since I joined the TV station, I've been in touch with news all the time with the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when I read the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe was happy and confident that he was "good at reading Mama news."
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sense.
It has been cultivated through watching father's stage, film, television, and period dramas in childhood.
In other words, I think my father's thanks to the various experiences of my childhood.
Experience the 300-year history of kumidori | Miyako Mainichi Newspaper Website - The latest news of Miyakojima is packed!
Workshops in Kagamihara
Workshop on the role and effect of five musical instruments played in kumidori (group dance) = 26th, Kagamihara Junior High School
The group dance workshop (hosted by the Prefectural Board of Education Education Agency) was held at Kagamihara Junior High School on September 26.
All students attended and learned about the 300-year history and birth of kumidori, as well as the acoustic effects and utilization of musical instruments played.
In the workshop, members of the OB Association of the Ryukyu Performing Arts Department of the Prefectural University of Arts introduced the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing three lines, koto, drums, kokyu, and flutes.
The host was from Miyakojima City, where Mr. Kata Kawama of the OB association served and introduced the charm of kumidori.
In this workshop, I learned about how five types of musical instruments are represented in dance by taking "music" out of three components of kumidori (music, chant, Ryukyu dance).
It was explained that the three lines were an element of the movement and emotional expression of the characters along with the songs, and that the kokyu was pulled up by singing and playing the melody of the three lines.
In the latter half, the students experienced the sound of the instruments and felt the charm of the instrument.
This initiative has been implemented with the aim of becoming familiar with "Ryukyu classical music" through musical instruments and giving students an interest in "gumi Odori" for the first time in Miyako.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
It is the first of its kind to be held in Gifu, Aichi - Yahoo!
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The FIA announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!

The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020.
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Rally Championships in which the International Automobile Federation (FIA) manages, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
It has been held every year since 1973 and has become the world's highest rally championship with history and tradition.The competition is said to be the most challenging car competition because it is not only closed public roads (paved roads), but also gravel roads and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Invitation Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, the 2020 WRC Japan Round was decided at the World Motorsports Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Shoo Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.) and Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), both governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work with relevant parties to achieve the success of the Fall 2020 Games in order to be the center of Japan's motorsports industry to appeal to the world greatly."
Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all."
Mr. Shoo Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)

The main venue is "Love Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is tasmaniadeville the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmaniadeville may be the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurred in Tasmania Devil and humans.
It is hoped that this discovery will create new ways to treat cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCullum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy could significantly change their treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing fatal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags would no longer respond to markers because they used a series of proteins called PRC2 to cam fullage, and the immune system would not attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
Peter McClum researcher Mark Dawson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Reuse traditional treatments, revitalizing markers, or proteins known as MHC, may enable immune systems to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils, where cancer cells escape detection.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process occurs in humans and Tasmanian devil cancer," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may help control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-type planets orbit around a small star called Red dwarf, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting the red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun's size, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, led this research published in Science, said.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed primarily of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only significantly smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planets, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is very low to about 3800 Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I'm red."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining its elliptic orbit.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which create stars orbiting themselves.
In the most powerful planetary formation model called the "core accumulation" model, the object is formed from solid particles in the disk, and the gravity produced by the egg of the planet causes the surrounding gas to become atmospheric.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star may have been slightly larger than expected, and the temperature may have been lower."
In this state, the disk becomes unstable, so some dense areas may appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant soy dip, and a colleague in charge
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating a dip of beans with a stimulant to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of the transfer of methane fetamine, a Class B felony, and of taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavits obtained from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returns to work, her stomach gets worse and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, in a local hospital where a woman went, soy dip could have mixed methane phetamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández "didn't put drugs on the victim's food," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane fetamine into the beans dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows Medina Hernández turning his camera back and clinginging behind a microwave, but taking something out of the brazier.
After that, it is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put the beans dip in a small paper plate.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been contaminated at present.
Medina Hernández was imprisoned in Marion County Prison, instead of a bail of $5.2 million.
According to The Smoking Gunn, Medina Hernández's long-term arrest record includes a history of assault, robbery, suffrage, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Asks can be organized" President of JR Tokai, attaching importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
Shin Kaneko, president of JR Tokai, held a press conference on the 27th, stating that "it is better to separate the issues that have arisen in consultation with Shizuoka Prefecture in response to the decrease in the flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the Nan Alps Tunnel of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen, and that it should be done before starting construction."
More specifically, he said, "We will talk at the meeting place and at the front stage."
President Kaneko said, "It's not easy to start construction after organizing all the problems, and I think it's possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea."
There is a strong concern that the prefecture cannot return the spring water to the Oi River during the tunnel construction.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he said, "If there is anything realistic, but I think it is difficult to think about the safety side of construction."
The change of route mentioned by Governor Hirata Kawakatsu denied that it was impossible.
President Kaneko pointed out three locations: South Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station, which take a particularly long time for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Saga News | Saga Shimbun
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required reorganization and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced their hospital name on September 26.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in the country, and three are already integrated and transferred.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Citizen Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital in Taramachi, Fujitsu County.
Of these, the Takyu City Hospital and Kojo Municipal Hospital are planning to build a new hospital in Higashi-Takyu-cho, Takyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating surpluses for several years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi stressed that "the town has the idea of operating alone and cooperating with neighboring city hospitals, and the hospital must remain absolutely for residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The administrative director of the Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "I don't hear the contents from the prefecture," and he said, "I will actively participate in the prefectural regional medical planning coordination meeting and respond to it based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Organization for Promotion of Regional Medical Functions (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not to mechanically determine the direction of public hospitals, but to request a review at the Regional Medical Concept Coordination Conference in each prefecture."
"I would like to hear from the parties about the future hospital operation.
In some cases, it may be necessary to review medical subjects and to further reduce the beds."

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise frequent guests of the Royal Navy aircraft
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use a private machine that moves the royal family around the world for important events and appearances.

During the "Royal Flight Secrets" program, the Queen's former flight attendants revealed that many of her hairy guests with her family often ride.
Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, like most important royal customers, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggy Dog Privileges are famous, and it is not surprising to ask her if she wants to take her cute pets to travel together.
Queen Elizabeth loved dogs since she was a child, and it is said that she had more than 30 coggy dogs.
In 2007, he had five dogs: Monty, Emma, Linette, Willow and Holly.

In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "Being a mother is like being in an advanced class to let go."
My job was almost always to find myself that children want to be, and to keep the right distance to grow.
To find out who they are, in essence, rather than the ideals for children as parents or the aspirations of their childhood.
Mrs. Obama, who actually knows the pressure of spotlighting around the world, advised Duchess little by little in the Interview of Good Housekeeping.

Trump Hotel owner's suitability also holds a liquor sale license.
Washington (AP) - The Alcohol and Beverage Commission in Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel, as the owner's suitability was questioned.
On Wednesday, three MPs, two former judges and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on the state law that the applicant's "appropriateness" is required to obtain a liquor license.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year included repeated deceptions against President Trump's assault and violating state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time that an appeal was made to update the permit.

Here are 11 honeys produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive officer in the manufacturing department of Bentley, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we set up a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers watched the bees from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains as they were gathering various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers through its Crew Plants and our business.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of bentra honey.
Small steps lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to play our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million bees of bees were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, it was completed to remove the nest frame from the nest box and put the nest frame into a centrifugal separator and filtered the fallen honey.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The design of the label was designed by Louise McCallum, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to the fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we would like to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey such as scones.
it's the worst of the u.K. in a scandalous report by the Cleveland police.
A police officer named him the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continues to "aggravate serious deterioration," says Phil Gomley.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, efforts were made to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley of the Police Department said, "It has been a long time since we finally investigated it."
Police chief Mike Wiel resigned in January less than a year before his appointment, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
Deputy Director Adrian Roberts was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Herwood came to the Investigation Committee last year to investigate illegal acts because of his colleague's involvement in sexual acts.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Interior Ministry intervenes."
Police Chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal," the impeachment must be settled.
No one knows what will happen.
We are currently involved in the cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate."
"I'm going to do a job that I'm starting to do based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Wolodymyr Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zerensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Giuliani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was the national security attorney of the Ministry of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before formal inquiries.
The Ministry of Justice, charged with inquiries from information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of political fund violations.
In response to Barr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee decided to testify.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the telephone talks with the President of Ukraine in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision regarding the disposition of this accusation.
Pelosi said he was "very concerned" when Trump attacked whistleblowers on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of spies was different in the past.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about those who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about the alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political gain and wrote a historic step.
The call was included in the accusations released on Thursday, and the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office in the next 2020 presidential election to "see intervention."
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-grade computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Ventek, driving ban by speed violation
Christian Ventek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old forward confirmed on January 20, that he had driven his Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 speed limit in Richmond, southwest London.

Bentekke, living in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek pleaded guilty of these two violations under a single answer procedure, in which one Justice of the Security tried and sentenced him to light crimes.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu, concerns about the composition of the judging committee
Cofi Manu, the football administrator and executive of Secondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the next GFA election review committee.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davies and expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu said that the chairman was interested in the results of the review process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should be composed of a fair and neutral member from outside of the previous interest, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kwak Palmer about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic champion.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club, but if Palmer attended the committee, he suggested that he was biased and unfair.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday after the ceremony held at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19 and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Appocavi, sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54-2 percent of small and medium-sized firms in Fukui Prefecture thought that "the minimum wage should be 1,000 yen."
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and middle-aged employees, and 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded with "approved" to raise the hourly salary to 1,000 yen, including information related (100 percent), construction (70 and 6 percent), and wholesale (61 and 7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including eating and drinking and staying.
The representative of the meeting said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high proportion of opposition in industries where part-time workers are often paid."
An average of 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
After hearing the hiring status of the company in March 2007, a total of 61.3% of regular employees were hired, 54.5% were employed, and 15.4% were employed.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44.7% for new graduates, 50.3% for mid-term graduates, and 31.1% for non-regular employees.
In particular, the transportation industry (37.5%) and construction industry (24.1%, 38.1%) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% of the respondents said they had problems in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, they said, "The low profile of the company" "I can't present favorable conditions for wages."
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information to new graduates (departure within three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the respondents said they already agreed on the sub-sector and/or business proposed by the government in the growth strategy.
Including 20 and 3% of the "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total showed acceptance.
There were 64 and 4% of companies that "disapproved": construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%), and manufacturing (72.7%).

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiprick said, "It's a show now," when Wales will be hosting the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Walladés, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will probably be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, which had previously played 15 games, won 14 against Wales, Tiprick and his team would be the best eight against England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to challenge and end up winning at the top of the group," said Tiprick, Wales.
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last autumn.
I think Australia will be blamed for returning the loan, but I will try to win it again.
I knew this game was a mountain before I came here.
And now I'm here, it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
Under the supervision of Warren Gutland, the total score for the Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight 3 team was only 7 out of 41 games.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was included in several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
Surely the game was tough, maybe everyone thought it was impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so I seemed to have been far more competitive."
In order to win Wales, the key is the break-down battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Back Law.
Up to now, Tiprick has played 67 international matches and has played several matches and two players in the past.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you will always know that you will be facing a tough game from now on.
They are always the best in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs.
I want to improve myself by fighting against the world's best players rather than playing against the background.
If you want to fight against the best opponents and fight against them, you have to keep up with yourself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings 90 percent of the gala, would it really be a gift from a comedian?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said in a press conference on July 22 that "the company is 9 and there is no talent 1 or so at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha rebounded.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the ratio of "9:1," the views of investors who were deemed to have received gifts from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and were taxed, were also tweeted over 30,000 times.
If Galla's share was "9:1," would there be a gift tax?
I heard from Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen is "9:1," the profit of 1 million yen in sales and 100,000 yen in expenses will be 90 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, we should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you think about the allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount I received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be a gift if the performer does not recognize it, even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, the third party will not be able to decide how much tax-appropriate prices are for those transactions that both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen's payment statement is a poison.
[Interviewing Cooperation Tax Rishi] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working at a bank, he registered as a tax accountant in 2008 (recording, financial statements, corporate tax law, income tax law, inheritance tax law).

the white house, a panic without impeachment.
The White House officials said Thursday that they were moving forward to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party, and that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be increasing "confidents, anxiety, and worries" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't really know what it is."
The White House officials joked that the lack of clear plans for this situation and the fact that the usual measures that the President has made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied was so serious that they were not convinced how to proceed, "It seems not to be erased from the next news reported."
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's unquestioned response to the impeachment was increasing.
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is seen to be raised every day, and some close associates of the president are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has spurred concerns about increasingly unpredictable actions and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about Presidents and politics in the electoral year.
Trump has faced the greatest threat ever seen in his presidential term, and has transformed himself into an attacker or a defender, such as reviving his strategy that he considered effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Moller.
Trump tried to distract the Ukrainian president's request to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of whistleblowers as they were motivated by factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the Morale trials, but this time they are starting to feel the difference.
The president, whose power is branded, seemed to be attending the press conference on Wednesday.
Although Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, it seems that he was not willing to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that damage can be mitigated, claiming that it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that President Trump and Vladimir Zellensky had no direct information of the call with the Ukrainian president.
Furthermore, it often happens when the President is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategy close to the White House points out that the basic support of the President is already very high, and that the impeachment will not have much effect on gaining new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news within 4 o'clock, "there is no advantage to focus on impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those claiming impeachment could help the President did not fully understand how uncertain the response of the President would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained this plan, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as strategic decision rooms will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum of the publication and publication of critical internal accusations against Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic viewpoints is clearly visible, such as Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin, who stated that they would not publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president after 48 hours.
According to a person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called Trump's external pitbull and Corrie Luwandouski, who served as the head of the former electoral campaign headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We have done everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we have never met with the President or his close associates about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney Jay Clow is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Mollah investigation, left Pat Ciporon, the current White House legal adviser, with little experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy is generally recognized that officials are far from recruiting human resources and building strategic teams, but need to be organized and lead the response and political struggle that everyone has done.

Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) The survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered it.
Since love is done with five senses, the relationship is deepened by seeing the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touching), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long-distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost issue.
If you go to the other person's house, the time and effort to go to the transportation costs will be burdened, and even though it is a holiday to heal the tiredness of work, the body is kata.
I feel refreshed when I return home.
Isn't it necessary to break up after a distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure without having to meet frequently or a couple that has a certain period of time.
If you're engaged a year later, or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult to see a future landing point.

Debbie Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Senator Debbie Nunes seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, in a statement to defend the President, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain presidential nude photos.
Senator Nunes, the Republican executive of the House Information Special Committee, filed in a statement at the beginning of the hearing about Trump's internal accusations that he had asked the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son to investigate.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democratic Party of this Special Committee negotiated with the Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the President, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes, Huffpost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democratic Party was trying to find the truth.
He was the only member of the House of Representatives Jim Heims of the Connecticut Democratic Party to answer so far, but many other members doubted whether the answer to the House of Representatives was a red-naked truth.
Mediate Dotcom speculates that Nunes' nudist comments may be related to "more detailed and unconfirmed details," which are said to have been written in steel documents that are controversial.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected in Trump watching prostitutes urination in a hotel room in Moscow.
Origami, wallet and real card.
Money transfer, loan, insurance and investment - Yahoo! News
In addition to payment by Origami Pay, Origami Wallet is an app that allows money transfer and withdrawal (moving) through collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and Representative Director of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the challenges of the younger generation who have to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates," adding that "I would like to provide services that are equally useful for people who have been alienated from finance and those who have not benefited from the current system."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origami ID, it will be seamlessly completed from application to transaction, and you will be able to get information timely.
He also explained that by deploying the Origami app not only on the Origami app but also on the app of partner companies, it will be available services even if you don't have the Origami app.
In terms of financing, we introduced a feature that allows for post-payment in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were needed suddenly, it was completed on the Origami app from application to repayment.
In terms of insurance, he introduced Aioi Nissei Insurance as a partner company and Dai-ichi Life.
The two companies will use their data and knowledge to develop insurance products in line with life events.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually through registration of necessary administrative agencies.
New businesses for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support the effective use of data, including data held by the company, in addition to digitizing customer contacts by its Pay through the payment function provided by Origami.
Origami recognizes that effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge in partner companies that partner with Origami, such as sales and non-structured data, accumulation, processing and analysis of data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with payment data by its Pay and structured data owned by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.
Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies gather various data and make customer contacts," and explained, "In the next phase, how to use data to develop business models is key."
"We want to create the next phase of innovation by combining data built on the Origami Network and data from many companies."
Details of specific services will be announced sequentially.
In addition, at the Origami Conference 2019, Origami's future initiatives, such as providing coupons to smartphones when it rains, provide convenience through mobile technology.
In addition, Origami Pay is now fully compensated for compensation for unauthorized use, but it is clearly defined as a system under terms of use.
He also stated that he will work as a supporter in cooperation with the Tourism Association and other organizations to revitalize the region.
It was held in Aweena Osaka, Osaka on September 7 to commemorate the singer Mitoko Ogasawara, who died at the age of 100 this July.
the people involved showed up their representative songs
Approximately 140 people from Japan participated, including fellow compatriots such as Mr. Masaaki Hunaga, Chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, and Mr. Yukie IKEBE, Chairman of the Japan-Korea Music and Arts Exchange Association.
At the ceremony, President Kokei IKEBE greeted him.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I can't believe that the teacher died yet."While preparing for "Remembrance Meeting," Ms. Mitsuko Ogasawara felt that he was a great and great person.
On top of that, he said, "If we can expand the meeting even a little, we can do it."
After being devoted to silence, the Messe-ji was introduced by Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the Korea Art Exchange Association and the International Institute of Chuchu Thought.
Potential reduction of exhaust gas in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only aircraft to fly in the sky that can not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agricultural and Bioenvironmental Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude oil-based fuels, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology was achieved by hydrocarbons of molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try the reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon tax on them."
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, and recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a 25 million US production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher for fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decisions given.

Boris Johnson warned that Britain would face riots like Los Angeles if Brexit was overturned.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a danger that a "strong uprising by the people" would occur in this country.
The Prime Minister's officials warned that Britain would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson said he needed to "enhage anger" against the political words exchanged in intense discourse, but insisted that he would not use the term "defeat."
Despite the fact that the prime minister appealed to the Times to regain his calmness, one minister said: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Yellow Best Movement or the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country just because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best movement -- they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and there's a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 against four white policemen who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstration participant Gire Joan, wearing the eye-catching yellow vest, has caused confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be catastrophic.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It takes so much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a danger that a "strong uprising by the people" would occur in this country.
Johnson wants to hold a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing the House Rebellion, which lowers the demands for EU withdrawal and instead calls for a compromise to hit the EU.
TeNY TV Niigata - Yahoo! News

Niigata Albirex BB players and staff prayed for victory at Komachi Shinmeigu Shrine in Niigata City on the morning of the 27th.
Last season, Niigata won the club's first district championship.
However, after the end of the season, Davante Gardner was transferred to other teams in the B league.
This season, with new foreign nationals, Nick Perkins, we aim to win more than last season.
"It is important to increase the strength of the speed and defense required by the head coach more than last season so that the results of winning the middle district last season will be improved."
The opening match of Niigata will take place on Saturday, October 5 at Away against Albuquer Tokyo.
Pakistani social media celebrity brother, a life sentence for honor murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure takes longer to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the incident fades.
"It takes too much time to forget people," said Farzana Bali, a female rights activist and founder of the first gender department at a university in Pakistan, adding that it took more than three years to resolve the issue of Baroch, which is attracting attention.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but in 2018 the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "principal murders."
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much more than that, because it is estimated that Pakistan accounts for about one fifth of the 5,000 honor killings occurring worldwide every year.
11.3 billion yen Countermeasures against pork cholera To add to the September supplementary plan in Shizuoka Prefecture (Magyo Shimbun) - Yahoo!
A total of 14.8 million yen was added to the supplementary budget plan for September 26 by the Congressional Steering Committee, which included a total of 13.6 million yen (about U.S.$136 million) for the emergency response project for pork cholera and 12 million yen (about U.S.$2 million) for the decision-making expenses necessary for the acquisition of land for the elevated JR Numazu Station.
It is proposed to the prefectural assembly on the 27th.
The total budget for the supplementary budget for September is 81.87 million yen.
In response to the outbreak of a new pig cholera in Saitama Prefecture, the prefecture has expanded the disinfection point of livestock transport vehicles currently in Konishi City to three locations in Gotenba City, Fujinomiya City, and Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City, near the Kanto region.
The cost of the project is 7.74 million yen.
In addition, in order to prevent the spread of wild boars, which are the main infectious pathways, we will start measures to ensure that wild boars are not infected by pig cholera even in areas other than western prefectures.
The cost of capturing and inspecting 1560 heads in eastern and central prefectures is 58.6 million yen.
In the decision-making process related to the elevated Numazu Station, the cost of commissioning the appraisal evaluation of the planned site and operating expenses associated with the holding of the subcommittee committee are added.
According to the prefectural government office, it was accepted on September 19 that the prefectural government and the city of Numazu requested the surrender of the unpurchased land on the 18th.
In the future, a vertical inspection of application forms will be conducted at Numazu City Hall on October 3-17.

flood and chaos caused by prolonged monsoons in india
The monsoon season in India has been prolonged for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces in early September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37% higher.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, the monsoon will weaken in the last few decades.
There are still unprecedented rains in many parts of India, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays resulted in the collapse of the building and several deaths.
The houses are flooded, and the residents walk through the streets with water on their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Laknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In the northern part of Uttarakhand, heavy rains caused damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
The prolonged monsoon is undesirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Meherer, a small farmhouse in Bimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "I'm currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival will be in Dašera on 8 October, with the Hindus setting up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, an evil smiling figure of a beard that appears in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroys evil.
However, since dolls are made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, the last laugh may be Lavana.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides and increased risk of heart disease and heart attack
Recent studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may lead to higher risk of heart disease.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to male groups that did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu, who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women or other races because it is targeted only by Japanese Americans.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and heart attack in work is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably due to the increased importance of other factors related to aging, which hides the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko intervention at the conference of Zerensky Trump telephone
The U.S. President Donald Trump's impeachment procedure was a radical week in Washington's political affairs.
For political beginners Vladimir Zellensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
But what has been known so far on the Zellensky Trump telephone issue, and is there a wide range of influence on Zellensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States is more convenient to Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not literal, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's objection of 100% rather than 100% is controversial.
Zelensky added that President Macron and Merkel both did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties, argued on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the EU's assistance including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytica said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scolded military aid and asked Zellensky to investigate two rather than one, the first of which was against Joe Biden's son Hunter, the second of which was an investigation of the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hamper European relations or lay backwater against French and German leaders.
i don't want to tell anyone.
Thanks to the announcement of the call, I would like to thank the people who helped me."
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards for international civil aviation.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana with an interim rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification survey (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Air Force's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was recognized by Ghana to comply with the ICAO recommendations and agreements on safety at airports and national airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's delayed National Zero Campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for security evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was awarded to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador to Ghana to Canada Nii Aiko Otou, and Director of Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Benad Aliu stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to keep in mind that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also said that the award is a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's intractable efforts and patience.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy as "airs are likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but they are all safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump appoints Peter Gino as FEMA Chief: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled at the National Security Senate Committee meeting at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Secretary of FEMA, was the deputy director of government disaster response such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been absent since March, when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, decided that Mr. Long had illegally used government vehicles to commute to work between Washington and his home, Norcarorina.
Jeffery Baiard, who had been recommended by another person, raised suspicions that he was drunk in alcohol and involved in a riot, and was excluded from the selection at the beginning of this month.
Mr. Gino's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Authority in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying activity in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant on suspicion of selling illegal marijuana pen-type beeps, care began at 4:37 p.m., and a large container of Butanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found at an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators also found equipment packed with beep cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," said Captain Kano.
Capt. Cano said he had previously been engaged in drug investigations and could fire in the process of extracting oil used in the Bayesian products.
"Only static electricity from clothes can fire, and because it is concentrated, it will cause not only fires but explosions," says Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions and fires one after another.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
An anonymous information was received and it led to an investigation warrant on the site that found illegal activity.
The investigators are still trying to figure out who the illegal Beip campaign is.
The police said that because the office was empty, Zhang himself thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police said they would like to receive recent news, especially about the dangers of bating, to avoid frequent illegal babyping products.
"I don't know whether it's real or not."
Products may be mixed with other hazardous substances.
It may have a great deal of harm to our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a 6-strong earthquake!
Evacuation training in Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
In anticipation of an earthquake in the middle of the concert, a practical evacuation drill was held at the hall of Miyazaki City.
This training is held every year.
On the stage, a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department is performed, and it is assumed that there will be a 6-strong earthquake in the middle of the song.
About 300 people including kindergarten children, local residents and hall staff participated in the training on the 27th.

(Interviewed in Hall)
"It's an earthquake, it's an earthquake, it's an earthquake.
After that, the participants were evacuated to the entrance in anticipation of a fire.
Earthquakes that do not know where to occur.
Participants raised awareness of disaster prevention through training.
The lost dress of Elizabeth I, exhibited at Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver leaf threads, and the gorgeous embroidery of plants, animals and butterflies was fluffy.
Elery Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, is determined to be one point.
This faded piece of cloth, which Lin saw on the wall of a small church in the countryside, was placed there 100 years ago and is considered to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally found this gorgeous cloth, which was used as the altarpiece of the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited next month at Hampton Court Palace, near exactly the room where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one other dress left in the 16th century shows that it was an important discovery throughout the royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence that Elizabeth passed the sleeves to the dress, three years of research has led to the increased conviction of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The exquisitely expensive fabric "Ginito-based cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but the quality of the plant and flower embroidery also suggests that the later added deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears were noble figures.
It is believed that the dress was equivalent to a Tudor mansion when it was built.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is assumed that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or had no patience with rivals wearing such luxury clothing.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to announce it, so he came to see his colleagues.
I was always very happy to see the cloth and say, "It's amazing."
A long second life of one piece of dress that was cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton is not as expected.
Baxton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life.
Although the dress dates back to 1590, experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley before Elizabeth died in 1603.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, 400 hours of specially dyed silk and fine surgical needles, the altarpiece cloth, which is costing a very delicate hand-sewing, will be exhibited next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a modified greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and the work led by Libby Thompson said, "If you're dealing with historic fabrics, you're really impressed by the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the front and back, you will find a very respectable one against the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of requests has been searched" A week after missing girls, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew The volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared in a campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared, and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 police and SDF personnel.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Force has invested 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk such as mountain slopes and Sawa.
On the 27th, the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search disappeared, and the search was not found.
The police and fire department will continue to search from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral speech in Miyazaki - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech in the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court in July of this year.
In response to the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation because the value of one vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member was the smallest in the country in July.
In the first oral argument held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the Defendant's prefectural election manager asked for a rejection of the claim as "it should be constitutional, not that it was in an extremely unequal situation where the issue of constitutionality occurred."
The judgment is passed on October 30.
Meeting with the representatives of the meeting.

Arriving at the Space Station | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
No. 8 Konotori, an unmanned supply vehicle that arrived at the International Space Station.
The robot arm of the station is growing from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th.
On the night of the 28th, Astronaut Konotori No. 8 (JAXA) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) of about 400 km altitude arrived near the station.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the difference in speed and approaches about 10 meters away.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters long is the flow that grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching it to the station, the flight crew carries the luggage.
one third of mexico drug cartels
Chicago Immediately after the sunrise of Chicago West Side, CBS News captured rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in daylight.
Nearly 800 people died of overdose in Chicago last year.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king, commonly known as El Mencio Servantes.
Matthew Donahew DEA executive officer in Mexico said, "Mencho is DEA and, in fact, the top priority of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of El Mencho's drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartels, Harrisco Nueva, are involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "massive" cocaine, methane fetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and returned to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From six dead Mexican Army helicopters shot down to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho dies without punishment.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders involving drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occur a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing when handling it.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped with a smuggler.
More than one third is thought to be made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively take the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.

The Tennoji Zoo (Tennoji Ward, Osaka City) opened a farewell party for the male koala "ark" in Osaka Prefecture.
In mid-October, it was decided to rent a zoo in the UK for 10 years.
thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of Koala, where eucalyptus grew, spared their part.
He is 12 years old.
Coala's life expectancy is 15-20 years, and it is expected that he will complete Tenju in the United Kingdom, where he is married.
Mr. Hideki Tsujimoto (40), the keeper in charge, cried, "It's hard to put the curtain down on the rearing of the core.
Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news release, PS4 game was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of its sequel, Last of As, February 2020.
Some of the video games of this new action game were shown to fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in various ways.
The last-of-as-part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous one, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell stories with so many characters.
I didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but it eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game was very large and did not enter a single Blu-ray, but two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although this surprise is not ruined, Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic Notic Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will know more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the sequel release.
Sony recently released the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
The MLB The Show 19 will be released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including a popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replica, and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Local residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, the Notoshima Regional Development Council (Notoshima Regional Development Council) was established by residents.
In a trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings, and food crossed the Somachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
There were also products that sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents asked for continued "help" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including general vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiro gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Suso Machi-kai, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Ms. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
The user also ordered "I want you to have coffee that drips on your own rather than canned coffee."
The council will consider what was requested.
There is currently only one convenience store in Notoshima where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to help "shopping weak."
Until December, the 20-machi-kai in the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether it will continue as a business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to add about $100 million to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been reviewed significantly to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be allocated to the drought-affected community support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to $100 million of drought relief funds for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional assistance, the government has already budgeted over $70 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen, Katie Stay, and four of his five children.
Haskell told the authorities that on July 9, 2014, he was pushed into the house of Stay and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department announced that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 sons, 9 and 7 daughters died.
Only one of his family, Kashdi Stie, was 15 years old, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed from prison until Monday.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook her voice with anger resonated with the leaders of other countries.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and frustration were protesting all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people attended in over 150 countries.
He also marched in Morioka with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will be launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than two degrees.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to be related to global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, continues in various places.
In order to achieve a faster pace of global warming, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit held by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal of virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new targets, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become conspicuous.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy is to set zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming at "zero 50 years."
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at an environmental meeting, said at a meeting on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool and sexy."
The appeal does not deny, but is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wounds that cannot be discussed will not be the same as the "replacement of issues" that the person himself counters.
The international community has to deal with the common crisis of humanity.
The effectiveness of each country's efforts is not sufficient.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act without taking away that future.
to realize quantum internet
The results of the U.S. Army's research have led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and time-keeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute Distributed Quantum Information Center of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and measured in one, even if one quantum bit is physically far from the other, the measurement results are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is two-digit and realistic to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bitpoints in entangled states despite the large distances.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
The enthanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains enough quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured in ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with fiber optic cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
First, the light particles were sent through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nm, the optimal value for long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
This photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
In the measurement results, atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured simultaneously with high-quality "clock" quantum bits, which leads to the realization of an entangled network of long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate position measurement, navigation, and time-keeping applications."
