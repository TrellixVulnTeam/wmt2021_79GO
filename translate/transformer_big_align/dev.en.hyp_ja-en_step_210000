Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwest Bosnian towns and protested the Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in the town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the barracks in Trugovska Gola and vow to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," and "Don't stop it."
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grad, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and rivers.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss the expansion of waste treatment facilities next week.
On Friday, Croatian national broadcasters reported that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or whether Slovenia should pay for the amount of waste processed in newly constructed facilities.
Tomislav Chorich, Minister of Environment and Energy of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials, and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would Bosnian pants pocket - the Turkovska gola - be the best place in Croatia?"

Although the number of users has increased explosively, Yasuda is an "employee man" who sells the introduction of PayPay to customers, that is, stores.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business so far.
The president also listened to Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's peak now.If you're not able to talk to me before you jump, or if you're doing a consumer reduction business together, I'm sure you'll talk with PayPay, so I'm getting a member of the store registration and I'm riding a wave now quite a bit."

What is Münchhausen Syndrome as a proxy for Netflix's The Politicians?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are ill.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States, but first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
It was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, with appearances by Gwinnes Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, even though the person under their protection is not seriously ill.
There are many different types of pathologies, including Munchhausen syndrome, which is false that they are also ill.
However, the surrogacy of Munchhausen syndrome implies that others who are clearly protected are ill.
It is also known as FII, forgery or induced disease, and is a type of child abuse.
Although it is unusual, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if children are ill.
So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following issues as a precaution.
The child is healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as by mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Excessively administered drugs and other drugs cause disease symptoms.
How general is Muhnhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.
what should we do if we suspect a child's damage?

Nigeria: Police raided the school in Kaduna and rescued 300 children.
The Kaduna Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
Police say that the children were placed in an inhumane environment, but the school denied this claim.
Residents calling themselves the school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
Parents came to deliver meals to their children every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were doing.
I was very surprised to have closed the school after the police arrived, evacuated the children, and all the food the parents delivered left.
Although there are parents who can testify to the terrible environment the police say, this is unfair."
He adds that Abdullahman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what the children were in, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police chief Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

According to the Board of Education, the gender of the public high vows has been removed from Osaka Prefecture and Fukuoka Prefecture since 2007, and Hokkaido and Kanagawa Prefecture have decided to remove them from FY20.

Central Coast's "extraordinary adversity" girl raped in camouflage clothes, an order to confront victims in court.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending a school in Central Coast, Kentucky.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to wood and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges, including this assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on the road and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and a knife coming out of the bush suddenly.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, don't stop."
The man told the girl, "Don't speak loud.
He said, "I'm going to have to deal with it."
The man had a knife on his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused for nearly an hour.
When a man broke the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at work around 9:30 a.m., with several phone calls and phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood out with mud, grass, and trees on his clothes, and was involved in street violence, and when he chased the driver to the bush, he claimed that he had been around by hand.
The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development is based on public interests and warns IT representatives.
On Friday, Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors that the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice if not accompanied by ethical assessments of public interests.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
In the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increased mechanical work, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand, and responses by social media companies during the atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines freed workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances are causing increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If the so-called technological advances of humans are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will go back to a kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, we would like to leverage the expertise of the participants in this conference to find people who can become future advisors to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.

Fan excitement with Real Madrid loaner Martin Woodegor and uplifter.
Martin Woodegor gave a surprise assist to Michel Oyalsabar.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, breaking the record for the national season and making it the top spot in La Liga.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, director Genedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves, and was surprised by Michel Oyalusabal's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won home in 3-0.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite pass through the inside of the other two players to Oyalu Sabar, where he scored the goal with this completely accurate slew ball.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third penalty spot of the stunning Oyalusabal, he ensured the overwhelming victory of the Imanol team just before Arabes' midfielder Manu Garcia left 5 minutes earlier.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated this territory.
Anna Hazale, the name of Sharad Powerl in the Muralashtra cooperative bank fraud case, was astonishing.
Anna Hazale said, "When this lawsuit came in contact, the name of Sharad Powerl was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerl in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Office (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Amit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
Based on the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the Central Authority.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit came in contact, Sharad Powerl's name was nowhere.
An executive lawsuit and alleged that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said Thursday, "Only they know how Sharad's name came up and who mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerl, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerl denied all misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the October 21 elections in Maharashtra.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, stating that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
NCP referred to the lawsuit by the Executive Bureau as a political abbreviation.

Stop the accident on the accelerator pedal!
Four rapid launch prevention devices that can be reared - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by a mistake in driving.
Among them, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistake by elderly drivers is on an increasing trend.
In particular, when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes panic and the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
There are new cars equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such a mistake, but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended cars.
This system is designed and sold by after-sales parts manufacturers.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform you of pedal mistake from a new perspective.
It is to avoid the pedal mistake with "an alarm sound."
The mechanism causes "an alarm sound" when stepping on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping, it avoids rapid acceleration.
It is difficult to understand changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are prone to hearing.
It is attached to the OBDII connector, and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excl. tax) and it is affordable and easy to set.
[Ashimo Watching kun] The World Wing started selling in mid-September, and the Ashimo Watching kun, an accelerator and brake step prevention device.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
When the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped in from the stop (and less than 10Km/h), the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantly control the start-up by turning it into a creep running state (the brake is removed in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and forcibly switch the vehicle to creep.
The mounting is only possible with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Ms. Saori Kusumoto (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that the three-year-old child who liked the nursery school suddenly stopped wanting to go to the nursery school after the flood damage, and was forced to stay at night.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up the house and have not had enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can not panic and say, "It's okay."
Yukari OGUSHI (36) of Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
"If there is a child who can't stay still, I will use my mind around him."
A woman in the center of Saga City (45), with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the event of a disaster with food and simple toilets.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinako Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a child of 6 and 8 years old, said, "The elementary school had an e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or a mail system.
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I don't know what it was like before.I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
President Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Arcuri Contact the police agency
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandals of the Mayor of London in violation of the Penal Code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts of conduct" on suspicion that Mr. Arcuri had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists if there is information that indicates that a crime may have been committed," says GLA.
This has never been proven.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations issued by the English and Welsh police.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the police chief at the time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, despite claiming that he was "extraordinary."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it seems that the press had received preferential treatment for U.S. citizens who emigrated to London seven years ago, with Johnson paying 126,000 pounds from public money during the mayor's time in London, and with Johnson joining three foreign trade delegations.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 to the hacker house, a company under investigation by Mr. Arcuri.
The company will be asked questions that will be puzzled about the investigation process before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns the British telephone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arcuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessman was "public secret among the staff."
The move of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities touched the anger of the Prime Minister's official residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The supervisory authority did not submit any evidence for any charges, and the Prime Minister was not given the opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will be able to see the political kyogen that was created by the amasama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division, was "public secret."
The former staff of London & Partners (L&P) stated that despite some who considered the company "unreliable" at that time, Arcuri had the privilege of attending a trade-related meeting abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Awakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, about the future prospects.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the 20 years history.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the people involved, not the history that has played with the power of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing it for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from anxiety about money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operations will not be performed unless they walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" has a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result is a 20-year long-term long-term fund and we believe it is because we continue to be a direct sales system that delivers messages directly to many people.
In the report at the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc miller's death, the third drug arrester, the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in overdose of drugs last year.
According to the court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl, which he had previously held before he accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has been plagued by thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record released on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Levis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is charged with delivering drugs to Pettyt as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in detention, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The prosecutors in charge of the case, first reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the start of the trial because of the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on 4 September, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics include a frank word about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke out in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram and published a song called "Suncue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died related to opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died of overdose of drugs in 2016 and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of more than 30 mobile games in Nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hide-and-do game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, animations and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch the bats that come out of the hiding place.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that "we're spending time building games when we're bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5-15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
At the age of seven, however, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a bit angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but why don't you make games yourself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care about it."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has named the game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The youth population in Africa is the highest in the world, and if it becomes an innovation in Africa, young people like Basil will take the initiative.
Two 12-year-old Nigerians have recently been awarded a robot that uses program code to organize household chores.
In May 2019, the girls' high school team in Ghana, Akrobo, who programmed a boxed robot, won the Robofest Contest.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil-chan and his children are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, guilty of false charges in the bribery investigation.
According to court documents submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely testifyed to federal agents investigating corruption in major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' attorney, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Hayes deems.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor charged with the involvement of former Congressman Hayes in a plan for a senior insurance company to fund the state's insurance director's election.
Both Greg Lindbergh and his co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cozy.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindbergh supported Republican ideas and politicians, but also contributed to the Democrats.
Lindbergh's lawyer called for a comment on Friday, e-mail, but did not respond.
On Friday, Hayes' Defendant, Kenneth Davis, also called for additional comments via email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken with Corsey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a factual document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecution also said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Corsey, and that he had a direct bribe with his supervisor.
The indictment, published in April, claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to hold up to $2 million in his campaign to re-election in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for replacement of officials who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported the alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no suspicions.
In an indictment, it is described in a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cozy that Lindbergh co-owners instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would draw attention if he did so much money, but was eventually broken in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
i understand, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an email asking for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like other people's posts!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and only posts can be seen.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager, Mia Garrick, said that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who consider the number of happy surveys and likes to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garlic said, "We had very positive feedback from a number of bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
It only removes numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange rather than the number of likes and reactions.
Garlic said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test has been conducted.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when this test will end or change.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experience, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has very aggressive "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram users.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

Self repair of broken bag fittings to otok ♪ 【Cando】 "Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was the handcrafted parts of Cando that helped me.
when i gave up saying, don't sell anymore.
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pra product.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main body greatly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for what changed to this connected fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver color.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was moved when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
Originally it seems to be a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle, and we bought two pieces.
The size of the ring is small, but if you align it with the bag fittings on one side of the left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
it's a smooth installation.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, movement is poor ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The number of fittings has increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight has no problem at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts has increased and leveled up in design.
The express train "Aso" of the National Railways will be temporarily operated by Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours journey | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era
A temporary train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 people, including railway fans, boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station and left for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" organized by JR companies, a tour of Japan was organized.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs on the Sanyo Line, Chikuto Line and Kagoshima Line.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother was sentenced to life in prison for the honor murder of a social media star in pakistan.
Candy Barochi, who gained fame with photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was found guilty of murder of his sister on Friday, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the "honorary murder" of his father-in-law, Pakistan's most popular.
Baloti, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
His brother said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, "Of course," and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar (the thought of God) will be acquitted in the Supreme Court," he said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Barochi's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of neglecting the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "honorary murders."
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed or strangled by crimes such as choosing their own marriage partner, commending their sexuality and exposing their family to shame.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisers and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow perpetrators to be pardoned by their relatives.
Three months after Barochi's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honor killing.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the murderer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Barochi's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, the sad parents, who thought they would lose their son, changed their minds and asked them to forgive their son.
Due to international hatred of killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team, and wearing a bright red dress on Valentine's Day.
It became critical and threatening, but it was recognized by many people, including young people, when the new heavens were opened in a country where expression of oneself as a presence like Kim Cardassian is considered a bold and political activity to improve women's status.
The origins of "principal" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

Kenichiro Shigeki "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Shigeki has been thinking twice as much about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko stick to the traditional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool guy.
if you're bound by what you should do, you'll be able to live.
In the first part, "coolness" is constantly evolving, so we talked about various works and the behavior of people, and we need to learn patterns every day.
When we learn patterns, the brain systemizes the behavior so that we can live in Lak.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I'm "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
I taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit tough if you're stuck with the old pattern of "the university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will live.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
In my recent interview book, "Life - No matter how terrible it is in the world," I talked about that.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by allowing people around him.
He doesn't want to be light.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record do not need to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by the "thinkness," you cannot be light.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of position or age, it seems that "cute" is a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to say what this "cute" is.
what is it?
In the northwestern part of Nigeria, the illegal state doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 in the last four months due to increased violence.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, a new humanitarian crisis is born due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, a new $35.5 million fund-raising activity is required by each institution.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist organization that has been active in the northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in the last ten months of Nigeria in Sokot, Zamfara and Kazina was by organized armed groups.
"The fear of illegal and unstable conditions is well represented," Barrok said on Friday.
Abducts, tortures, robbers, murders and sexual violence have occurred frequently, and the media reported that the attackers have destroyed their homes and worked on theft.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoharam and the West African branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," he says.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR stated in a statement that the security situation in Sokot, especially in the province of Sokot, was deteriorating, and that refugees going to Niger would increase in the coming months.
the new trial date for a man who killed two women and two children is confirmed.

According to the police, on 16 July, in a house in Des Moine, he shot Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and her son (5).
The court records that a new date of trial will be decided on 27 January, giving the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare for the trial.
According to officials of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Bureau, Escobar Ollyana was illegally staying in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.
The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising in header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their needs.
The Service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a mechanism in which a fair bid competition for multiple bidders (advertisers) can be prioritized to deliver high-priced ads to media operated by media companies.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
In the past, SSP has been used to provide advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year in collaboration with media companies to directly purchase advertising frames in line with advertisers' requests.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP is expanded.
The benefits for advertisers are that LFP header bindings allow them to participate in direct header bids to target ad frames, which can improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, because the target media companies are limited, the advertising frame of the destination is secured in line with individual commercial materials and brand image, preventing brand value damage.
One of the advantages of media companies is that LFP's "Lapper Solution," a solution that manages the code of each Vidder company, can be implemented in conjunction with the hope of introducing media companies.

Two months of suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata University in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that an assistant professor in his thirties at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Department of Internal Affairs and Communications, Assistant Professors of the Department of Internal Affairs and Communications, from around October 2017 when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, were emotional and repeated intimidating behavior such as insulting in inappropriate words, giving strong mental stress.
As a result, the school's education system deteriorated.
A survey conducted in September 18 reported several students.
The management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and from December of the same year, the members of the Harassment Prevention Committee of the Yonezawa Campus conducted an investigation, and finally a student filed a harassment complaint.
Based on the findings from the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
As an assistant professor, he continued his education after the survey, but through interviews, his actions were improved and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Oyama said, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to take all my studies to prevent harassment and restore confidence."
The University also conducts internal research on the suspected sexual harassment of female students led by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Rebels demand Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and to compromise with the EU The Sun
Just three weeks after the EU summit meeting, the Prime Minister's concern is growing around the Prime Minister.
Boris Johnson faces a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of withdrawal from the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system instead of a backstop clause related to the Irish border are tight, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative as "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will propose a compromise proposal on the ground floor, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They will demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings without agreement and claim that the EU will accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One cabinet member said that the Supreme Court's ruling on the closing of Congress on Tuesday was "a warning," and that "the compromise is the only way we can leave on October 31."
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister shall use whatever is available from his steps.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and the Cammings project is clearly failing.
It is impossible to fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to implement the previous Prime Minister's proposal, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many that everyone is trying to end this.
If we postpone it, Boris will end, and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering the negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a harsh speech, said: "The Prime Minister wants to connect with the EU.
However, we do not see the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to form an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Whales, and discussing with the people in the streets - as if the election campaign was full-fledged."
The Prime Minister's press yesterday acknowledged that the agreement was still a long way ahead, saying, "No one should think of it - if it is to achieve the goal, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month delay if it does not agree, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue moving forward despite the bill's passage."
Stephen Barclay, Minister of Delegation of the European Union, returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two discuss how food and livestock are regulated in all Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by television bosses that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, 59 years old, said, "I was so nervous."
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I will never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Dave Break, and then began a program named Lorraine.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, she will broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
"The passion and enthusiasm" and "the curiosity" were the secret to survival in the television industry, and the moderator said, "You have to put it in your work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that it was "very painful" to investigate the Dunbrane shooting.
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't even think that many of the families of the children who were killed or injured were watching us broadcast live from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, personally told me to meet me, so we talked for hours at her house.
Not taking it all on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very hard" and that "he really respects the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing the trap.
According to a senior government official, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of President Robert Mugabe, who was in the midst of a political change, due to fears that it might be a trap to refute military action in November 2017.
During the coup d'état, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Chiwenga declined the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders of all over the world and the African Union that he was stripped of the regime in a coup, rather than from anxiety.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirms that officials are senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munnagagwa," it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to senior officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three.
It was reported by President Spokesman George Charanba, then head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Nepera, and Fidelis Muconoli, Roman Catholic bishop.
Gideon Gono, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to denounce military action by the African Union, seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the presidency to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of the former president.
"It was a wasteful act to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there were some political aims of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If anything destroys the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I would like you to remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would break down the claims of the commanders claiming that he was trapped and did not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the whole situation, would decide whether to position it as a coup, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the presidential house called Brurouf, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders at that time accurately read their intentions.
In the words of an envoy (gono) telling the president's desperate message, a powerful metaphor was used: "Is Tiri Bemmacwapa McWhapa (we belong to the camouflage group, the military department), and we are not politicians or just in political competition."
The Army told the local commanders that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to bring back Munagagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at the time, the South Africans who were key to this process refused to intervene, but were repeatedly threatened behind it, making it clear that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, it didn't come to fruition," the sources tell the Independent.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to the ban on nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th, a meeting was held at the UN headquarters in New York to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.
Five new states ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, including 32 countries and regions.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications took place in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total elimination of nuclear weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also spoke and expressed strong concern over recent years that there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There's nothing else to stop."
China needs strong leadership.
Before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will lead to division and collapse and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the repression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemoration ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he took power in late 2012.
Mr. Xi has also directed a military modernization program that threatens the region.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its development models, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but rather only seek peace.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the bully, and war and confusion left a deep scar with that pain; China would never give the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as the economic downturn and the anti-government movement in Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never abandon its nuclear interests, nor allow security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"The threat of trade war and the rising tariffs do not lead to any problem-solving," White Paper states.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"We will never weaken the trade war."
I am convinced that China has the power to face difficulties, change crisis into opportunities, and open a new world.
He added that the United States should take the development of China calmly, as China has no idea of countering the United States and does not want to replace it with the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko. (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Oteru Takayama will be acting as the coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local newspaper had an appeal to the baseball club.
After hearing the situation from the two students, Director Hirata grabbed the student's neck and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the facts were confirmed again by the two students.
In the summer of the 15th year of Yokohama, Motochika WATANABE (74), who was raised by Daisuke MATSUSAKA and others, bravely withdrew.
It was under the supervision of Director Hirata and Director Kaneko.
In the summer of the 16th century, he participated in the Koshien Garden for three consecutive years, and this spring he also participated in the Senbatsu.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in the autumn, and the Senbatsu tournament in the next spring was hopeless.
The Spice Girls' Mel C, a diet disorder disease, banned dieting at home.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, from his experience of eating nothing but fruit and vegetables for many years, admitted that diet was banned at home.
Sporty spices, under pressure from members of the global pop group, have been "excessive exercise" for many years without eating enough, and have subsequently been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by his daughter Scarlett's child-rearing, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old, and I'm getting a lot of attention to my appearance," says Mel.
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking to my daughter.
Positive words, now it's a habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, a "bad" comment on himself written in the press led to physical problems, Mel said in an interview with Women's Health magazine.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, I became obsessed with exercise more and more, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Judiciary judgment on same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch made a decision to approve the case in a case where 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage could be established even in the same sex.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, and there is a system in which local governments such as Sapporo City authenticate same-sex partnerships without legal effect in Japan.
Based on this, the court recognized the fact that two women were actually married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to allow same-sex couples to have legal protection.
The same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Registration Law, and lawsuits for damages to the country are filed in five district courts such as Sapporo.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system for recognizing diverse families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years, and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The decision was based on the results of the two living together, and it was recognized that "the reality of marriage between men and women is no different."
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of fact-marriage that has the same rights as marriage through social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that defines marriage as "only based on the mutual agreement."
Both sexes were "unpredictably same-sex marriage at the time of establishment, so it is not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
While the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the absence of same-sex marriage, "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women," the problem remained.
It may be difficult to distinguish the right to protect while recognizing the same situation as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, about 70 percent of people believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" recognized by law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in the tax system and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only the same-sex marriage but also the expansion of legal rights for actual marriage.
Trials and jury trials of former athletes prosecuted for rape by multiple women
A jury trial is held for former Delaware University baseball players who have been accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and speech, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
A 21-year-old woman stated that she was sexually assaulted after sending Conaway to her home by car.
The two met after three weeks of meeting at Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women's inconsistency and memory differences would have regretted having physical relations.

【Dospo】Oda is the first 4th and the most self-executive 20th after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
It became a reward for the seniors.
He took the lead four times and ran his 20th home run with a liner on the left.
I reached the number of home runs I was aiming at, "I stopped this number and tried to do it again, and it became a big one."
The director's intentions were also firm.
This was the first time a four-point transfer was made.
He said, "I put it in number four so that I could swing by thinking."
Oda responded to his expectations: "I felt that way, and as a result I entered the game, I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal four statues is Abe, a giant who retired from active duty this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads us to victory, and the 4th is the team's 4th when we get results every day, and the 4th seniors who have seen the giant were the same."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, video clearly
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, Circler Keys, Luna Park and some famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with suckers, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing through the road surface into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting waterways.
In a video released on September 27, coincidentally on the day of world tourism, Dr. Catherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
Although its appearance is certainly beautiful, it is one of the highly modified and polluted estuaries of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kg per hour are expected to flow into the waterways, most of which flow through the rainwater drain into Sydney Harbour.
"The heavy rains were falling several times, but Sydney Harbour was... quite tragic," Dr. Daffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what's going on there," said Richard Nichols, owner, Dave Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is underneath the water surface), I think everyone will be really excited.
Over half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The remaining half of the plastic is used at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone can see all of this plastic and garbage flowing down the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said that it is possible for local residents and tourists to reduce plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30% of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it back to its old appearance, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, coincidentally with the release of the video funded by TOMRA, a recycling company, as part of a broader awareness of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between 12 and 18 years old have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also stated that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed were increasingly worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.

This time, Mayo Takahashi, a free announcer and monthly commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," spoke about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save my rotten self.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is beyond his father and is like a master.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
It is different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was told that I was a cone or a busaik, my father said, "I thought it was a cone, but it wasn't.
After that, when I was in my second or third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty female anna can do it," and when I didn't get motivated because I didn't go around the job I wanted to do, even when my heart was rotten, "Anyone can do it hard, I asked Mama to do it, but I was glad that I was in charge of it.

There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but since I joined the TV station, I've been in touch with news all the time with the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when I read the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe was happy and confident that he was "good at reading Mama news."
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sense.
It has been cultivated through watching father's stage, film, television, and period dramas in his childhood.
In other words, I think that my father's work is thanks to the various experiences of my childhood.
Experience the 300-year history of kumidori / Education Promotion Project | Miyako Mainichi Shimbun Website - The latest news of Miyakojima is packed!
Workshops in Kagamihara
The workshop on the role and effect of five instruments played by kumidori was introduced.
The group dance workshop (hosted by the prefectural board of education) was held at Kagamihara Junior High School on the 26th.
Students from all schools participated and learned about the 300-year history and birth of kumidori, as well as the acoustic effects and utilization of musical instruments played.
In the workshop, members of the OB group of the Ryukyu Performing Arts Department of the Prefectural University of Arts introduced the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing three lines, koto, drums, kokyu and flutes.
The host was from Miyakojima City, and Mr. Kawamata of the OB Association, who introduced the charm of kumidori.
In this workshop, I learned about how five types of musical instruments are represented in dance by taking up "music" among the three components of kumidori (music, chant, Ryukyu dance).
It was explained that the three lines were an element of the movement and emotional expression of the characters along with the songs, and that the kokyu was drawn up by playing the songs and the melody of the three lines.
In the latter half, the students actually touched the instrument and experienced the tone of the instrument, and felt the charm of the instrument.
This initiative has been implemented with the aim of becoming familiar with Ryukyu classical music through musical instruments and giving students an interest in "gumi Odori" for the first time in Miyako.

What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship (WRC) is one of the four World Championships in which the FIA is responsible, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, it has been the world's highest rally championship with a history and tradition, and the competition is said to be the toughest car championship because it runs not only on closed roads (paved roads), but also on gravel roads and snow roads at high speeds.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparation Committee was established to host the event in Japan.
As a result, the 2020 WRC Japan Round was decided at the World Motorsports Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Mr. Hideaki Omura, Governor of Aichi Prefecture
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and in order to be the center of Japan's motorsports industry, we will work together with relevant parties to work hard to achieve the success of the Fall 2020 Games."
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motorsports, commented on the Japanese round.
The Japan round of the WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya City, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Shitara Town) and Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ebisu City).
The main venue is "Love Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
The Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is tasmaniadeville the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmaniadeville may be the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells are camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
This discovery is expected to create a new method for cancer treatment.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy could significantly change their treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing deadly face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags would no longer respond to the marker because they used a series of proteins called PRC2, and the immune system would not attack the cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
"The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy," said Mark Dawson, researcher at Peter McClum.
Reuse traditional therapies, revitalizing markers, or proteins known as MHC, may allow the immune system to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face tumors in Tasmanian devils where cancer cells escape detection as well.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process occurs in cancers of humans and Tasmanian devils," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
But if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, they may be useful for controlling tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-type planets orbit around small stars called red dwarfs, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting its main star, Red dwarf, was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
But in this case, the size of stars and planets is not much different, researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun's size, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, Astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, led this research published in Science, said.
The theoretical model shows that low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, it is almost the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is very low to about 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380° / 3527° C).
That's why it's red."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its star system in the past, explaining its elliptic orbit.
Planets are produced from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which produced the star itself orbiting.
In the most powerful planetary formation model called the "core accumulation" model, the object is formed from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes the atmosphere by pulling the egg from the planet.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might have been slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature was lower," Morales said.
Since the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense regions may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant bean dip, and a colleague indictment.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is accused of having his coworkers eat a dip of beans with a wake-up.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was charged with suspected transfer of methane fetamine and taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit obtained from OregonLive.com, a colleague of the suspect (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane fetamine before, "After eating some mouths, I thought it tasted strange, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach became sick and her legs were fluffy.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, at a local hospital where women went, bean dips could have mixed methane phetamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee told Medina Hernández that he "didn't put drugs on the victim's food," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane fetamine in the bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Derri shows Medina Hernández turning his camera back and clinginging behind the microwave, but taking something out of the brager.
It is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put a bean dip in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been contaminated at present.
Medina Hernández was detained in Marion County prison instead of bailing $5.2 million.
According to The Smoking Gunn, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of felony by assault, robbery, supplication, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Asks can be organized" President of JR Tokai, attach importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on 27th, Shin Kaneko, President of JR Tokai, stated that the issue of reducing the flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the South Alps tunnel of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen line should be discussed with Shizuoka Prefecture, "It is better to separate the issues that should not be organized before starting construction, and that it should be done after starting construction."
More specifically, he said, "We will talk at the meeting place and at the front stage."
Mr. Kaneko said, "When we organize all the problems, we don't think it's hard to start construction, and I think it's possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea, and we have to talk about it."
The prefecture is concerned that the spring water that came out during the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he said, "If there is something that can be realistic, but I think it is difficult to think from the safety side of construction."
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the route change mentioned was "not possible."
President Kaneko pointed out three locations: the South Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station as a time-consuming place for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Administrative and Social News|Saga Shimbun
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required reorganization and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced the hospital's name on 26th.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in the country, and three are already integrated and relocated.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu Municipal Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital in Taramachi, Fujitsu County.
Of these, Takyu Municipal Hospital and Kojo Municipal Hospital are planning to build a new hospital in Higashi-Takyu-cho, Takyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating surplus in recent years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi stressed that "As a town, we have a concept of operating alone and working with hospitals in neighboring cities, and hospitals must remain absolutely for residents," and expressed negative views on restructuring and integration.
The administrative director of the Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "I don't hear the contents from the prefecture," and said, "I will participate actively in the prefectural regional medical planning coordination meeting and respond based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Organization for Promotion of Regional Medical Functions (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not a mechanical decision to determine the direction of public hospitals, but a request was made at the Regional Medical Initiative Coordination Conference in each prefecture to review them again."
"I would like to hear from the parties about the future operation of the hospital.
In some cases, it may be necessary to review medical subjects and to further reduce the bedside."

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise and frequent guests of the Royal Family aircraft have been identified.
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use private machines that move royal families around the world for important events and appearances.
Of course, there is a privilege to have a private aircraft.
There is no need to be parallel to the long line of entry and there is no limit to the number of baggage, and the Royal Family seems to be able to invite guests, including unexpected passengers, as much as you like.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, only Queen and Prince Philip are frequent guests of royal aircraft.
During the "Royal Flight Secret" program, the Queen's former flight attendants revealed that many of her hairy guests with her family were frequented.
Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, like a very important royal customer, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggy Dog Privileges are famous, and it is not surprising to ask her if she wants to take her pet to travel together.
Queen Elizabeth loves dogs since she was a child, and has more than 30 coggie dogs since she became queen.
In 2007, he had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linette, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, five Cockerspanier vists, oxo, flash, pick, and spans, as well as four ciders, berry vulcan and candy mix dogs, Daxfunt and Coggie.
The staff on the Royal Air Force will be busy.
The royal staff were seen asking them to leave the dog on the grass before boarding, and Seals continued.
I've never had an accident before.
The show also found that the luggage during Queen's official travel was known for a shocking amount.
According to the Narrator, "There were 12 tons of Queen's luggage on a 44,000-mile Commonwealth tour in 1953."
It can be understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
However, the Queen does not like fashion.
The Marquesss of Cambridge are said to have their own taste when carrying their own clothes, and they are said to have one seat per dress.

In a frank conversation, Mrs. Motonaga looked back on how her mother and mother changed herself.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "Being a mother is like being in a senior class to let go."
I learned as my mother that most of my work is to find and grow the children who want to be.
To find out who they are, in essence, rather than the ideal for children as parents or the admiration of their childhood.
Mrs. Obama, who knows the pressure to take spotlights in the world, advised Duchess little by little in the Interview of Good Housekeeping.
sometimes you feel too big pressure from yourself and people around you.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't rush to do anything over time.
In the first few months of the White House, instead of starting to work motivated, the girls began to live in school well and careed for new friends.

Trump Hotel owner's suitability complaints, liquor sales license retained.
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Board of Alcohol and Beverage Auditors dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the liquor sales permit at the local Trump International Hotel, as it questioned the suitability of the owner.
On Wednesday, three MPs, two former judges and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on a state law requiring the applicant's "appropriateness" to obtain a liquor license.
In the first appeal submitted in the summer of last year, he accused President Trump of assault and repeatedly deceited him against state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the license was already approved.
This was the second time a petition was issued to update the license.
The honey collected by the bees "Flying Bees" bred by Bentley is the first harvest!
How is the taste of honey collected by Flying Bees bred at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September of the same year.
More than 100 honey bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the site of a factory that assembles cars?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honeys produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing division, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers watched the bees from wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains as they were gathering various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers through its Crew Factory and our business.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of bentra honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement a variety of initiatives to play our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million bees, Flying Bees, were launched.
And in September of the same year, after a summer, we had completed the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box, put the nest frame on a centrifugal separator, filtered the fallen honey, and then bottled it.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The label was designed by Louise McCallum, the designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to Fenner Tea which is compatible with honey, we also want to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey in scones.
it's the worst of the u.K. in a scandalous report by the Cleveland police.
A police officer named him the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
According to the Cleveland Police, "heavy deterioration" continues.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley, Director of the Police Department, said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Mike Wiel, head of the police department, resigned in January less than a year after his appointment, but was investigated for his actions as "deep" and yet unpublished.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee for the Illegal Act because of his colleague's treatment for sexual acts.
He resigned from the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Home Affairs intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal," and impeachment has to be settled.
Nobody knows what's going on.
At present, we believe we are involved in a series of cover-up cases, which may take some time to investigate."
"We're going to do what we're doing, based on the time it takes to discover facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Vladimir Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Giulani.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security lawyer in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged with inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of political fund violations.
In response to Barr's question of whether to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee would decide who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was always given," Pelosi said, referring to Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the July telephone talks with the Ukrainian president.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Perosi said that he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower who became the source of information, as Trump attacked the whistleblower on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
The president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who might have provided information to the whistleblowers is a significant loss in the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political gain, and wrote a historic step.
The call content is contained in the accusations released on Thursdays, and the whistleblower claims that Trump abused his office in the next 2020 presidential election to seek intervention in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-grade computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Bentek, speed violation prohibited driving
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.
The 28-year-old forward at Crystal Palace confirmed on January 20, that he had driven his Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 speed limit in Richmond, southwest London.
The Belgians then took a speed violation camera in Patney, southwest London, where they ran 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek was found guilty of these two violations under a single answer procedure, in which one justice of the peace tried and sentenced him to light crimes.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu is concerned about the composition of the Review Committee.
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the Review Committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of chairman Frank Davies and expressed his dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the results of the review process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside of the previous interest, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kwak Palmer about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if the Olympic Committee member Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his relationship with the club.
The members of the committee were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4.
The chairman is Frank Davis, a Corporate Governance Consultant, and the chairman is Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Emmanuel Darkwer.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Appocavi, sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and only 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded that they "approved" to raise the hourly salary to 1,000 yen, including information related (100 percent), construction (70 and 6 percent), and wholesale (61 and 7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink, and accommodation.
The representative of the meeting said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high proportion of opposition in industries where part-time workers are often paid."
The average salary of companies who answered "the opposite" was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, a total of 61.3% of regular employees were employed, 54.5% were employed, and 15.4% were employed.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (particularly 13 and 3 percent of new graduates, 37 and 5 percent of middle school students) and construction industry (24, 1 percent of new graduates, 38 and 1 percent of middle school students) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% had challenges in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the second graduate (department within three years after graduation) and mid-career recruitment.
There were also opinions to encourage students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% answered, "I have already accepted it."
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one-third of the total showed acceptance.
The number of companies "not admitted" was 64 and 4%, with construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%) and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiplic said, "It's a show now," when Wales is celebrating the upcoming World Cup Tennozan and Australia.
If Wales wins Wallabeads, they will be the hottest winner in Pool D, and perhaps the quarterfinal against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, which has played 15 games, wins 14 against Wales, Tiplic and his team will be a straight line for the best eight against England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to win and finish at the top of the group."
Until now, the fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last autumn.
I think Australia will be quite blaming to return the loan, but I will do my best to win it again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And now I'm here, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Wales has won third place 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gutland, the total score for the 3rd Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight Team was only 7 out of 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in a test match against Australia last November, but Tiprick was one of the top players to play at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiplic said, "It's hard to answer.
Surely the game was tough, maybe we thought we could not win, but we don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
To win Wales, the key is the break-down battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, an Australian duo worshiped as Buck Law.
Tiprick, who has played 67 international matches so far, has fought several games and both players in the past, and knows exactly what awaits him.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When I play against the background of the World Glass, I always know that I will be in a tough game.
They are always the best in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs.
I want to fight the world's best player and increase myself rather than confronting the very strong Bucklow.
I want to fight with the best opponents, and if I play against those two, I have to do my best.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
the momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you will be able to play a game that won't lose.

In East Enders, the column highway (Tony Clay) was surprised by Whitney Dean's sudden bomb news, so the column returned to the mistress, and the hot tension between the column and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowen) was on the verge of explosion.
But will the relationship between the two begin or will you regret this hot moment?
Since the column helped Ben and the troubled Bobby Beer (Cray Milner Russell), the relationship has been slowly progressing, but the column recently told Ben that he was happy to see Ben's weakness or gentleness.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from comedians?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said in a press conference on July 22 that "the company has no talent at 9 and no talent at all."
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the "9:1" ratio, it would be considered that there was a gift from comedians to Yoshimoto, and the view of investors who were paying taxes was also on Twitter.
If Galla's share was "9:1," would it be a gift tax?
i heard from you.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the tax standpoint.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If it is "9:1," Yoshimoto's sales will be 1 million yen and expenses will be 10 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
Also, even if you think about the allocation, you don't argue that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as in this case, a third party will not be able to decide how much tax-appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen's payment statement is a poison.

the white house, a panic without impeachment.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, explaining that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be increasing "awareness, anxiety and concern" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't really think it's true."
The White House officials joked that the lack of clear plans for this situation and the fact that the usual measures that the President has made to deal with the agenda so far could not be applied was so serious that they had no confidence in how to proceed, "It seems not to be erased from the next news reported."
Another person familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's uncontrollable response would increase the likelihood of "injuring" if the impeachment was prolonged.
Another source of information is that during impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised every day, and some close associates of the president are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has spurred concerns over increasingly unpredictable actions and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about the president and politics in the electoral year.
Trump faced the greatest threat he had ever faced during his term of office, and revived his strategy that he considered effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Morel, and changed his hands to become an attacker or defense.
Trump tried to lighten the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate with the investigation of political opponents, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of whistleblowers as they were motivated by factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the morale of the investigation, but this time they began to feel the difference.
The president, whose power is branded, seemed to be coming at a press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that damage can be reduced, claiming it is a fact that undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information on the calls with President Trump and Vladimir Zellensky, who are controversial.
Furthermore, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic family close to the White House points out that the basic support rate of the president is already very high and the effect of impeachment on new supporters is unlikely.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with legislative proposals and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those claiming impeachment could be the help of the president did not fully understand how uncertain the president's response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to the officials who explained this plan, this initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have a clear leader who can organize public relations activities in an aggressive manner in order to counter the momentum that the publication and publication of organized legal strategies and communication strategies and critical internal accusations had given the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin said that they would not be able to publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later.
According to a person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump, and Corrie Luwandouski, who served as head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never met the president or close advisers about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmet Frad, who was engaged in impeachment by Clinton and led the White House until the end of the Morler investigation, left Pat Cipolon, the current White House legal advisor, with less experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy is generally aware that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but need to be organized and capable of leading all-powerful response and political struggle.

I was able to have a boyfriend because of his work, but for a long distance love ...
"I'm going to get married someday," but I can't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we put the situation on our side and connect it to marriage?
Editorial I of Nikkei doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice and a must-read is derived from detailed data analysis.
what's this?
I am worried about whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during a long distance romance.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I have work and my family, but his place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It's said, "Let's get married in the future."
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, administrative office)
The couple who got married from long distance love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (hereinafter - -) C is in a distant relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested at a distance and the two become stronger."
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) The survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered it.
Since love is done with five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the other person (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touch sensation), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to an opponent's house, you'll be burdened by the time and effort you move to the transportation cost, and even if you're on a holiday to heal the fatigue of your work, your body is kata.
I feel very happy when I go home.
Isn't that the only way to break apart when it's far away?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure without having to meet frequently or a couple that has a certain period of time.
You'll be engaged a year later, or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you don't see a future landing point.

Debbie Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems to be unable to bear the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
Thursday, in a comment defending the president, accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Senator Nunes, the Republican executive of the House Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had requested to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He condemned the Democratic Party to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians to obtain Trump's nude photos."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes, Huffpost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democrats were trying to find the truth.
The only response to this was to Congressman Jim Heims of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, but also to many other members, it is questionable whether the response of the party is a red-naked truth.
Mediate Dotcom speculates that Nunes' nudist comments may be related to the "more detailed and unconfirmed" part of Steele's controversial document.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be seen in a room in a hotel in Moscow looking at prostitutes' urination and suggests existence.

New businesses for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support the effective use of data, including data held by the company, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its own Pay through payment functions provided by Origami.
In partner companies that partner with Origami, such as payment and settlement functions, effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge, such as acquiring structured data such as sales and unstructured data in a real society, and accumulating, processing and analyzing such data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with payment data by its Pay and structured data owned by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technologies and data.

On September 7, a ceremony was held in Aweena Osaka, Osaka City to commemorate the singer Mitoko Ogasawara, who died at the age of 100 this July.
the people involved showed the representative songs of Ogasawara
Approximately 140 people from Japan participated, including the chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Mr. Masaaki Yunaga, and Mr. Yukie Ikebe, chairman of the Japan-Korea Music Arts Exchange Association.
In the ceremony, Yukie IKEBE, the chairman of the ceremony, greeted him.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I still can't believe that Dr. Ikebe passed away."While preparing for "Remembrance Meeting," Mr. Mitsuko Ogasawara felt that he was a great and great person, and regretted his death.
In addition, he said, "We can do activities that allow us to expand our meeting even a little."
After the dedication, the Messe-ji, which was sent by Mr. Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the International Institute of Chuchu Thought, was introduced.
Regenerative biofuel research can reduce emissions.
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks and semis have monopolized the news, they are the only ones that fly in the sky and are not able to reach renewable energy.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta developed a technology to make renewable biofuels available as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% lower than crude oil-based fuels, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The achievement of this technology in the first generation is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem with jet fuel is like a dilemma that doesn't matter," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as biofuel for jets.
The first is a low-risk approach, which requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Regarding the second option, Dr. Bresler said, "You can try the reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the US Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They expect someone to impose carbon taxes in the future someday," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Currently, Foge operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, and recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a 25 million US production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler stated that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher for fuel transport and production.
"As a technologist," Bresler says.
My job is to create options so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decisions made after the explanation.

Boris Johnson warned that if Brexit was overturned, Britain would face riots like Los Angeles, the prime minister would call for calm.
A senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots of 1992.
Johnson stated that he "nearing anger" was necessary for political words exchanged with intense speech, but insisted that he would not use the term "defeat."
Despite the Prime Minister's appeal to regain his calmness, one minister told the Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Yellow Best Movement or the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
People do not think that riots will not occur in this country simply because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and then a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when the jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to a verdict of innocence.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstrators with eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House, stating that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be catastrophic.
"When 30 million people vote in a referendum and 66% vote in the EU, 10 million people are dissatisfied," said the Ministers.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed secession, 100,000 very angry people would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It takes less time for tens of thousands of people to follow the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of a "strong uprising by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a House of Representatives rebellion calling for lower demands on EU withdrawal and instead to hit the EU with compromises.

On the 27th, Niigata Albirex BB, a professional basketball player, took a week to open the B League.
Niigata Albirex BB players and staff prayed for a victory at Komachi Shinmeigu Shrine in Niigata City on the morning of the 27th.
Last season, Niigata won the club's first district championship.
At the end of the season, however, Davante Gardner was transferred to other teams in the B League.
This season, with new foreign nationals, Nick Perkins, we aim to win more than last season's regional championship.
Captain Jun Uzawa said, "It is important to raise the speed of the head coach's demand and the strength of the defense more than last season so that the results of winning the middle district last season can be improved."
The opening match of Niigata will be played on Saturday, October 5, at Away against Albuquer Tokyo.
he was sentenced to life in honor of his brother, a social media celebrity.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the incident fades.
"It's too long, so people forget," said Farzana Bali, the first female rights activist at a university in Pakistan, who said it took more than three years to resolve even the case of Barochi, which is attracting attention.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "principal murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the number of real honor killings is much more than that, because it is estimated that Pakistan accounts for approximately one fifth of the 5,000 honor killings of honor-based violence monitoring organizations worldwide every year.
11.3 billion yen countermeasures against pork cholera To add to the September Correction Plan in Shizuoka Prefecture (Magyo Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A total of 148 million yen was added to the supplementary budget plan for September 26 by the Diet Steering Committee, which reported that the prefecture would add 136 million yen to the pig cholera Emergency Response Project and 12 million yen to the decision-making related expenses required to obtain land for the elevated JR Numazu Station.
It is proposed to the prefectural assembly on the 27th.
With this, the total amount of general accounts for the supplementary budget for September is 8187 million yen.
In response to the outbreak of a new pig cholera in Saitama Prefecture, the prefecture will increase the disinfection points of livestock carriers currently in Konishi City to three locations in Gotemba City, Fujinomiya City, and Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City, near the Kanto region.
The cost of the project was $7.74 million.
In addition, in order to prevent infection from wild boars, which are the main path of infection, we will start measures to ensure that wild boars are not infected by pig cholera even in areas other than western prefectures.
The cost of capturing and inspecting 1560 heads in eastern and central prefectures is 58.6 million yen.
In the case of the decision-making process related to the elevated Numazu Station, the cost of commissioning the appraisal evaluation of the planned site and the operating expenses associated with the holding of the subcommittee committee are added.
According to the prefectural government office, the application for a decision to terminate the unpurchased land that the prefecture and the city of Numazu visited on the 18th was accepted on 19th.

Floods and disruptions caused by monsoons in India and many regions
The monsoon season in India has been prolonged for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month is usually 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues for a few days later, the monsoon will weaken at the latest decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, in western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays caused the building to collapse and a number of people died.
The houses were flooded, and the inhabitants crossed the street by water to their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Raknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rainfall.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains have caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
Longer monsoons are not desirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Meherer, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables will rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dashera on 8 October, with the Hindus setting up a large comic book-style doll, Lavana, the evil smiling figure of a beard that appears in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the dolls are made of paper, if the Monsoon pulls long, the last laugh may be Lavana.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
Recent studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the research.
Dr. Rodriguez is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women or other races because it only targets Japanese American men.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and heart attack at work is no longer important," said Dr. Rodriguez.
This is probably due to the increased importance of other factors related to aging, which hides the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
The researchers found that exposure to low- and medium-density pesticides was not important for heart disease and heart attack.
Poloshenko intervention at the conference of Zerensky Trump telephone
The impeachment process against US President Donald Trump was a radical week in Washington's political affairs.
For political novice Vladimir Zellensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
But what has been known about the Selensky Trump telephone issue so far, and is there a widespread impact on Selensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the U.S. had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zelensky's response to Trump's 100 percent argument is controversial.
Zelensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, debated on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for support received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the EU's assistance including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytica said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scolded military aid and asked Zelensky to investigate two rather than one, one against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is an investigation on the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to talk about anyone.
"We thank the people who helped us with the announcement of the call record," said Zelensky at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled for October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana with an interim rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordination verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Air Force's Global Safety Audit Report.
The Safety Award was approved by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO on safety at airports and in their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's delayed national zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for security evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was awarded to Joseph Cofi Ada Ghanaian Minister of Aviation, Simon Alati Ghana Civil Aviation Director, Nii Icoi Otou, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada, and Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company Director.
In his speech, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Bennard Aliu stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in the participating countries.
"It is important to always be aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada said that the award is a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's intractable efforts and perseverance.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to change our lives dramatically."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Court at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Secretary of FEMA, was in the position of deputy director of government disaster response such as hurricanes and wildfires.
Since the resignation of former Secretary of State Block Long in March, the office has been absent from the Senate.
The Department of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, decided that Mr. Long had illegally used government-owned vehicles between Washington and his home town, Norcarorina, and resigned.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, raised doubts about drunkenness and involvement in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of this month after consideration.
Mr. Gino's appointment as Secretary was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Department in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, large containers of Butanghanie oil were discovered at an office building on 9600 blocks on Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that investigators also found equipment that packed the beep cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," said Captain Kano.
Captain Kano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigations, and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used in the beep product.
"Only static electricity from clothes can ignite, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," said Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions and fires one after another.
The Dangerous Processing Unit was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigator said that he received some anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant on the site where he discovered illegal activities.
The investigators are still in pursuit of who is the black curtain of illegal Beip activities.
The police said that because the office was empty, Zhang himself thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to avoid getting out of illegal bating products.
"I don't know if it's real or what I'm buying."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great deal of harm to our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a 6-strong earthquake!
Evacuation training in Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
In anticipation of an earthquake occurring during the concert, a practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City.
This training is held annually.
On stage, a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department is actually performed, and it is assumed that an earthquake with 6 intensity will occur along the way of the song.
About 300 people including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff participated in the training on the 27th.

it's an earthquake, it's an earthquake, it's an earthquake.
After that, the participants were evacuated to the entrance, assuming that a fire occurred.
Earthquakes that do not know where to occur.
Participants increased their awareness of disaster prevention through training.
Exhibited at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver foil yarn, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Elery Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, is determined to be one point.
This faded piece of cloth that Lin saw on the wall of a small church in one countryside was placed there 100 years ago and is considered part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally discovered this luxury cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly the room where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
The only remaining part of the 16th century dress is that it was an important discovery of the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of the sleeves to the dress, three years of research has increased the confidence of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The elaborately expensive textile "cloth made of silver thread" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but also embroidered plants and flowers of the "name" quality suggests that the later additions of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears were noble persons.
It is believed that the dress was equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions when it was made.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace or could not endure the rivals wearing such luxury clothing.
Lin said that it's important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
Everyone looked at the cloth and was always happy to say, "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one piece of dress, cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton, seems unexpected but not so.
Bactton is a village from Blanche Parry, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and the local legend says that the cloth has long been associated with Parry.
Although the dress dates back to 1590, experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley before Elizabeth died in 1603.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on very delicate hand-sewing altarpieces, will be displayed next to the portrait of Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and led the work, Libby Thompson said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you're really impressed by the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at embroidered on the front and back, you will find a very great respect for those who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched" A week after the missing female child, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew Volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
On the 28th, the SDF closed the search and withdrew.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 police and SDF personnel.
However, the village requested the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw their request, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 days to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly on the slopes of mountains and dangerous places such as Sawa.
Also, on the 27th, the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search disappeared, and the search was not found.
The police and fire department are planning to continue searching from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech in a trial in which voters sought to invalidate the election was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court.
In response to the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation because the value of one vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member was the lowest in the country in July.
In the first oral speech held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendant side called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It is not said that the issue of constitutionality was in a significant inequality, but should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th ( JAXA provided)
On the night of 28th, the unmanned spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA) carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), which is about 400 kilometers high, arrived near the station, and the astronauts during their stay operated the robotic arm.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the difference in speed and approaches approximately 10 meters away.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters in length is the flow that grabs the supply machine.
The aircraft had about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching it to the station, the flight attendants carry luggage.
one third of the drug in the united states
Shortly after the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News caught rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
Nearly 800 people died of overdose in Chicago last year.
McNite said that "probably 90%" of Chicago's drug was brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king Nemecio Cervantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Matthew Donahew DEA executive officer in Mexico said, "Mencho is DEA and, indeed, the top-priority of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartels, Harrisco Nueva, are involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has sold "a large amount of cocaine, methane phenyl mixed heroin."
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and sent back to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho is not punished and is responsible for his own empire.
In recent years, thousands of murders have been caused by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped by the smuggler.
More than one third is thought to be made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively deprive the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the past.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent state of play announcement, Sony announced the release date of its sequel, Last of As, February 2020.
Some of the video games of this new action game were showcased by fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old wind in many ways.
Since the PS1 era, the last of as part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Notic Dog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous one, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to tell the story that there were so many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved to that extent.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all the other sections started."
The game was very large and did not enter a single Blu-ray, making it two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it doesn't want to ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs in the game include nostalgic Notic Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the sequel release.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
MLB The Show 19 will be released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including a popular character Ellie's backpack and bracelet replica, and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Save" Council Trial Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, mobile sales began by the Notoshima Regional Development Council, a local resident.
During the trial until December, wagons carrying daily necessities, seasonings and foods crossed the Susomachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
Some of the products were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents said that it was fun to choose goods.
There were 110 wagons, including general vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even older people who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpira gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Suso Machi-kai, the residents' columns were formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't think it would sell so much."
Ms. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
The user also ordered "I don't want can coffee, but I want coffee to be dripped by myself."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to help "shopping weak."
By December, the 20 town councils on the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to provide approximately $100 million additional assistance to drought-stricken residents.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by droughts have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been greatly reviewed to simplify them.
With additional assistance, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-stricken resident support organization, with the target farmers receiving emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-stricken areas, up to 13 municipalities will be provided with a maximum of US$100 million in relief for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted more than $70 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted of killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of the five children in Spring, Texas in 2014.
The authorities said on July 9, 2014, Haskell was pushed into the house of Stay and asked for the whereabouts of his wife Melanie Haskell.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), thirteen and four sons, nine and seven daughters, died.
Only one of his family, Cashy Stay, was 15 years old at the time.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed from prison until Monday.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook her voice with anger resonated with the leaders of each country.
Global warming is increasing.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and irritability protested all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people from over 150 countries participated.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will be launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to 1-5 degrees.
All participating countries shall take measures in place without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather conditions, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, which are pointed out to be related to global warming, occur in various places.
In order to achieve a faster pace of global warming, one step of efforts is required.
At a summit called by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become conspicuous.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy is to set zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at an environmental meeting, said at a meeting on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool and sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wound, which is not controversial, will be nothing more than the "replacement of issues" that the person himself counters.
The international community has to deal with the common crisis of humanity in a timely manner.
It can not be effective enough if there are deviations in the efforts of each country.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act without taking away that future.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The results of the U.S. Army's research have led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and time-keeping capabilities that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute's Distributed Quantum Information Center, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state, and one is measured, even if the other quantum bits are physically far away, the other is affected by the measurement results.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who published the results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bits in entangled states, despite the large distances.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at exits through the fiber also maintains enough quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and then excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with fiber optic cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
The team then sent the light particles through a non-linear crystal with a strong laser.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, the optimal value for long distance transfer - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance movement of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangled network of long-distance atomic clocks.
The large entangled clock network is a very important field for the Army from the viewpoint of accurate position measurement, navigation, and time-keeping applications."
