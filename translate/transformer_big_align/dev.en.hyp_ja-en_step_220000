Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of towns in northwestern Bosnia gathered to protest the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in the town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the barracks in Trugovska Gola, and to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," and "Don't stop it."
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grado, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which began operating in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss the expansion of waste treatment facilities next week.
On Friday, Croatian national broadcasters reported that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility, or whether Slovenia should pay for the amount of waste processed in newly constructed facilities.
Tomislav Chorich, Minister of Environment and Energy of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia wanted to find another location on its own near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the pockets of Bosnian trousers be the best place in Croatia?"

PayPay salesman "I'm on the Wave" "I'm on the Wave" Cashless to wake up "I'm on the Wave" I wonder if the waves will become swell (Tokai TV) - Yahoo!
Tax increase starting in October.
In line with this, the country will start the cashless point reduction project.
It is to reduce the cold consumption by up to 5%.
[See in the image] just before the tax increase ... shops and businesses are introducing cashless rush.
So what's happening now is "Introduction."
It is a cashless store that was previously a cash business.
We were close to the installation site.
[Cashlessing] Immediately before the tax increase "Initiation of the rush" ...
"Okakiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular restaurant operated by Takeshin Seika, and there are more than 100 kinds of oysters in the store.
Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users, visited Tatsushin on this day.
PayPay Yasuda: "Is there any payment method other than cash now?"
Mr. Shinmi, President of Takeyoshi Co., Ltd.: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it's easier than cash if I get used to it because it's no longer possible to receive a tsurisen.
Up to now, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce the usage by 20% points.
Although the number of users has increased dramatically, Yasuda is an "employee man" that sells the introduction of PayPay to customers, i.e., stores.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also listened to Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's peak now.If you're not able to talk about it before you dive, or if you're going to do a consumer reduction business together, you'll be able to talk about it with PayPay, and you'll be registered as a member, and now you're riding a wave."
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the country's consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves in Japan's Consumer Reduction Project.
As a result of the consumption tax hike in October, the government introduced a system to reduce the maximum amount of shopping to consumers by 5% to prevent the cooling of consumption.
Like "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before tax increases.

What is Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are sick.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinness Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, even though the person under the protection is not seriously ill.
There are various types of pathologies, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is false that they are also ill.
However, the surrogate Munchhausen syndrome implies that others who are clearly under their protection are ill.
It is also known as FII, a type of child abuse.
Although it is a rare symptom, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if a child is sick.
So what is the sign of Muhnhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary according to the case-by-case, but NHS notes the following items as a precaution.
The child is healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make the child feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Overdose medications and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How general is Muhnhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that 89 cases of 100,000 people had occurred in two years.

Nigeria: Police raided the school in Kaduna and rescued 300 children.
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday at the Imam Ahmed Bun Hanbar School in Rain Maidhuven Tunma, Igabi.
Police say that the children were placed in an inhumane environment, but the school denied this claim.
The school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering the school, parents signed their consent.
Parents came to deliver meals to their children every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were in.
I was very surprised that after the police came and evacuated the children, and all the food the parents delivered, they closed the school.
There are parents who can test whether they had children in such a terrible environment as the police say, but this is unfair."
He adds that Abduraman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhumane environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

In the Central Coast, a girl raped in camouflage clothes, an order to confront the victim in court.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending a school in Central Coast, Kentucky.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to wood and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges of assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking along the path and witnessed a man armed with a large tree branch and a knife suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, don't stop."
The man told the girl, "Don't speak loud.
He said, "If you don't, you'll have to get hurt."
The man had a knife on his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused it for nearly an hour.
When the man spilled the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., with several phone calls and phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood on his clothes with mud, grass, and trees, and was involved in street violence and chased the driver to the bush, claiming that he had fallen by hand.
The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, warning IT representatives that AI development is based on public interests
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats and investors on Friday that if there was no ethical assessment of public interest, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference, where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
A few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited to the conference, entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age."
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and responses by social media companies during the atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if he relied too much on robotics to pursue profit, he was alarmed that the dignity of labor might be stolen from humans.
"If advances in technology cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not the right true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will be counterproductive to a certain kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, we would like to use the expertise of the participants in this meeting to find people who can become future advisors of the Catholic Church on the high-tech field.
Nagano Appliance Directed by G Abe's debut song!
thank you.
Hiroshima and Nagano Kuyoshinote (34) started their career in the mid-day battle (Mazda) on the 27th.
The first double-death second base hit was "September" by Earth Wind & Fire on the appearance of giant Abe who announced his retirement this season.
The result was a liner, but a sensitive fan who noticed Nagano's stylish surprise was applauding.

Real Madrid loaned players Martín Woodegor, and fans excited with an upturn assist.
Martin Woodegor performed a surprise assist with Michel Oyalsabar's preemption.
Real Madrid won the Ossana at 2-0, renewing the country's undefeated record in the current domestic season and reaching the top of the La Liga rankings.
However, this season, despite not losing one game in La Liga, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champigns League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves, was surprised by Michel Oyalusabal's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martín Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, was able to pull out the opponent's crotch and sent an exquisite pass through the inside of another two players to Oyal Sabal, where he scored the goal with this completely accurate slew ball.
The second goal of Willian José and the third goal of the stunning Oyalusabal penalty spot ensured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before Arabes' mid-filler Manu Garcia left 5 minutes before the end.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015 but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally developed their own territory.
Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When we contacted this lawsuit, Sharad Powerle's name was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's executive branch (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Ajit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Financial Cleanup Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit was reached, Sharad Powerl's name was nowhere.
An executive lawsuit and suspicion that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name emerged or who referred it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerl, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct and claimed that it had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of the filing of a lawsuit just weeks before the October 21 elections in Maharashtra.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
NCP referred to the action by the Executive Bureau as a political abbreviation.

Stop the mistake of stepping on the accelerator pedal!
The following four categories are available: Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by a driver's mistake.
The number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistakes by elderly drivers is on an increasing trend.
In particular, when it comes to a sudden start, it becomes panic, and the accelerator may remain on the pedal because it is going to step on the brake pedal.
There are new cars equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such a mistake, but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended vehicles.
After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal spacing between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and at the same time it passes.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform you of pedal mistakes from a new perspective.
It is to avoid the pedal mistake by "an alarm."
The mechanism causes "an alarm sound" when stepping on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping, the acceleration is avoided.
It is difficult to understand the change in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf to hear.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is affordable, and it is also attractive that the setting is necessary.
[Ashimo Watching kun] The World Wing started its launch in mid-September, and the Ashimo Watching kun is a device to prevent accelerator and brake mistakes.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
When the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped in from the stop (and less than 10Km/h), the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I did not tell the signal from the accelerator and immediately controlled the start by turning it into a creeping state (the state where the brakes were removed in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to be cleaned up.
The mounting is only possible with capraon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

"The Shiraishi Town Child-rearing Support Circle Haguhagu" (Representative of Tomoko Tanaka) opened a discussion on the experiences and lessons of the Saga Heavy Rain Disaster at Ariake Public House in Sakata, town on July 27.
About 20 mothers who are raising children think about the form of disaster prevention suitable for each family, and summarize their awareness and requests for local governments.
Suosato Kusumoto (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked the nursery school suddenly lost their desire to go to the nursery school after the flood, and they were forced to leave at night.
"I didn't have enough time for adults to clean up my house," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can't panic and say "OK."
Yukari Ogushi (36) of Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
"If there is a child who can't stay still, I'll use my mind around him."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was watered around her house.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in a disaster, and I have food and a simple toilet.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparations will change in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinako Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a child of 6 and 8 years old, said, "There was an e-mail at elementary school on the day before, but there was no communication network or email system at the nursery school.
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "the last time it was okay."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as an organization."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri is a reference to the police authority.
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandal in London's mayor's office as a criminal offence.
The Greater London Administration Office (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts of conduct" regarding the alleged suspicion that Mr. Arcuri had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists if there is information that indicates that a crime may have been committed," says GLA.
This was never proven.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The issue was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations issued by the English and Welsh police.
This issue was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to that of the Chief of Police at the time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information about his relationship with Arcuri, while claiming to be "unconfirmed."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported that U.S. citizens who had moved to London seven years ago had received preferential treatment for Johnson's participation in three foreign trade dispatches with Johnson, who paid £126,000 from public money during the Mayor of London.
Since then, the government has frozen a £100,000 grant to the hacker house, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked questions puzzled about the investigation process before the grant is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "regular proper evaluation" and that the company owns the British telephone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Curi (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessman was "public secret among the staff."
The move of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory body touched the anger of the Prime Minister's official residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence for any charges, and the prime minister has not given an opportunity to answer the supervisory authority prior to the press release issued late on Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will be able to see the political Kyogen created by AMAsama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the friendship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division was "public secret."
The former staff of the London and Partners (L&P) stated that despite some of the people who considered the company "untrustworthy" at that time, they were privileged to accompany him to a trade-related meeting abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo!
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, about the future.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the 20 years history.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the people involved, not the history that I played with the power of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from anxiety about money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, the operation will not be performed unless you walk with the beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result is a 20-year long-term long-term fund, and we believe it is because we continue to be a direct sales system that delivers messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc miller's death, the third drug arrester, the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and prosecuted for drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had mistakenly held before he died of overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl in September of last year.
Walter is accused of supplying the drug to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold the drug to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petitt as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in detention, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutor in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the start of the trial, citing the high likelihood of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate reply to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video in his Instagram and published a song called "Sancue Next."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died related to opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, was also killed in 2016 due to drug overdose and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was changed to Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hide-and-do game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
The player gets points when they catch a bat from a hiding place.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that "we spend time building games when we're bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in numerous mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
At the age of seven, however, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was too obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," his father said.
I was so frustrated that I said, "I'm always playing games, but how about making games myself so that others can play it?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to be a scientist in the future, has the name of his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The youth population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it becomes African innovation, young people like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded a robot that uses program code to organize household chores.
In May 2019, a female high school team from Ghana, Akrobo, who programmed a boxed robot, won the Robofest Contest.
African investment by Google and Microsoft giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely accused federal agents of investigating corruption in major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a fact-based document prepared as part of a judicial transaction and signed by Hayes, Hayes was aware of a false statement to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based document does not specify which sin Haze admits.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecution sued former Congressman Hayes for involvement in the insurance company's plan to fund the state's insurance director's election.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery of Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated over $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindbergh supported Republican principles and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked for a comment by email on Friday, but did not reply.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the defendant of Hayes, also requested an additional comment by email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken to Cosey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cosey, and also met with his supervisors for direct bribes.
The indictment, published in April, claims that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to hold up to $2 million in his campaign to re-election in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported the alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no suspicion.
In an indictment, in a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cosey, Lindbergh's co-owner instructed Hayes to send $2.5 million to Cosey's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially objected to the fact that he would pay attention if he did so much money, but eventually broke up in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office of Prosecution requested detailed information on judicial transactions by email, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like to post others!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and only posters can see.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy director, Mia Garrick, said that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who consider the number of happy surveys and likes to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had a very positive feedback from a number of bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
It is only to delete numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange rather than the number of likes and reactions.
Garlic said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights they had access to.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test was conducted.
Instagram, a Facebook affiliate, has not announced when the test will be terminated or changed.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experience, but now it's the stage to listen and learn to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very active "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram user.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder Part (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!News
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If the fittings of your favorite bag are broken, I want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was the handcrafted parts of Cando that helped me.
when i gave up saying, don't sell anymore.
My mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Plasma.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, it was a situation that greatly exceeded the original price.
My mother unfortunately said, "I will throw away ...," but I didn't want to give up.
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this connected fitting.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was moved when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It is originally a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at each end of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you line it up with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is attached immediately.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, movement is poor ...
So I tried to make the ring a couple of times.
The metal fittings were increased, but because of the lighter parts, the weight was not a problem at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, the express train of Japan National Railways, is a temporary train, Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy a special train trip inspired by the express 'Aso' of the JNR era
A temporary train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 people, including railway fans, boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station to Kumamoto Station.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, the tour was organized by Japanese travelers.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo Line, Chikuho Line, and Kagoshima Line.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother was sentenced to life imprisonment for the honor murder of kandir barochi, a Pakistani social media star.
Candir Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of murdering his sister on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment with the most popular "honorary murder" in Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by his famous self-portrait photograph, which was not large in Western standards, but was provocative in Pakistan, which was very strong in women's contempt.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
In a press conference a few days later, his brother told him that he had killed his sister, and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar (the servant of God) will be innocent in the Supreme Court," the lawyer said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Baroch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of his misrepresentation of the laws of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "honorary murders" are rekindled.
In the case of Barochi, a woman chooses a marriage partner by herself, and in the case of Barochi, she burns, kills, stabs, or strangles her family with crimes such as praise for her sexuality.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya laws allow the perpetrators to be pardoned by relatives of the victims.
Three months after Baruche's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the murderer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Barochi's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, his parents, who were sad about losing his son, changed their mind and asked him to forgive him.
In response to international hatred of murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team, and wearing a bright red dress on Valentine's Day.
Although he was critical and threatened, he was recognized by many people including young people when he opened up new heaven and earth in a country where expression of himself as an existence such as Kim Kardashian is considered a bold and political activity to improve the status of women.
The origins of the "priority" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

(From left) ASA Amami Sports Academy
[Okinagarabu General Bureau] The NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda and Amami City) and the Okinagara Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda and Chinamachi) signed a partnership to support the promotion of remote island sports on February 25.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects carried out by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will establish mutual support systems in terms of health management and prevention of injuries, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both groups mediate, dispatch, and share information when training related to sports.
When a team of remote islands embark on an expedition outside the island, they will work to resolve issues such as the difficulties of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association with the ASA, in the event of a tournament on the mainland, such as a prefectural tournament, we will support the athletes to prevent their performance from falling due to fatigue on board trips and consecutive nights.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima and Okinagarabejima, it is said that they will support players from outside the island by cooperating with local resiliency hospitals and hospitals.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Élabcoco in Chimei-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.
After that, both organizations co-hosted a training session with Athletic Trainer Yuichiro Hidaka.
Local sports boys and club leaders and parents learned how to use taping properly and how to prevent injury.
Mr. Sonoda (52) said, "The purpose of our activities in terms of sports environment is shared with each other, and there are many areas where we can cooperate with each other.
Mr. Maeda (43) said, "It is very encouraging to have a partnership with a proven organization like ASA, and I would like to absorb good points in order to improve the sports environment for children from remote islands."
Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Mr. Shigeki extorted that the incomprehensible otoko stick to the conventional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such bad guys and become cool and cool.
if you are bound by what you should do
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about the need to look at various works and behavior of people and learn patterns everyday.
When learning patterns, I think that in this case, the brain systemizes the behavior, so I will be able to live in Lak.
I think I am still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I am "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
I taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you stick to an old pattern that says, "The university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will survive.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I've been talking about that in my recent book, "Life - No matter how terrible the world is."
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by admitting that person.
It's not that easy.
It's hard to ask around yourself.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, his surroundings will be treated as "a great filmmaker."
Those who have a track record do not need to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," it is not easy.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of their position or age, any man would like to be "cute" and saved.
It is difficult to wonder what this "cute" is.
what is it?
In the northwest of Nigeria, the illegal state doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled in the last four months due to intensified violence.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, a new $35.5 million funding activity will be needed.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist organization that has been working on anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Nigeria over the past ten months in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"The fear of illegal and unstable conditions is well represented," Barrok told reporters on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, assault, murder and sexual violence were frequently occurring, and that the attackers had destroyed their homes and worked on theft.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime organizations in the area.
However, the army was exhausted by fighting against Bokoharam and the West African branch of the Islamic State, which broke out in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," Barrok says.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees moved to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR announced in a statement that the security situation in Sokot, in particular, had deteriorated, and that refugees crossing Niger would increase in the coming months.

The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising in header binding by "Prebid.js" (LFP).
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their needs.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a mechanism in which a fair bid competition for multiple bidders (advertisers) can be prioritized to deliver high-priced ads to media operated by media companies.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
In the past, SSP has been providing advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in response to the requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to a particular ad frame that has a high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase advertising frameworks that meet the needs of advertisers.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP is expanded.
The benefits for advertisers are that LFP header bids allow them to participate in direct header bids and increase their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, due to the limited number of media companies in the target market, the advertising framework of the distribution sites along with individual commercial materials and brand images is secured, preventing brand value damage.
One of the advantages of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each bidder company, called the "wrapper solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, enables efforts to meet the expectations of media companies.

Two months of suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
Yamagata University announced on August 27 that a male assistant professor in his thirties at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the General Affairs Department of the University of Tokyo, Assistant Professors of the University of Tokyo, from around October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, were emotional, and they repeatedly expressed intimidating behavior such as insulting in inappropriate words, and gave strong mental stress.
He was a teacher of education and was recognized as having deteriorated the educational environment.
A survey conducted in September 18 appealed several students.
In December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and in December of the same year, an investigation was conducted by the Harassment Prevention Committee led by instructors at Yonezawa Campus.
Based on the findings of the committee, President Kiyoto Koyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
As an assistant professor, he continued his education after the survey, but through the interview, his actions were improved and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to make every effort to prevent harassment and restore confidence."
The University also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students led by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts Boris Johnson demands a compromise with the EU, reducing the EU's demands for withdrawal.
Just three weeks after the EU summit meeting, the Prime Minister's concern is growing around the Prime Minister.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of the EU withdrawal and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system to replace the Irish border-related backstop clauses are clogged, and the EU considers Johnson's replacement as "impossible."
The Senior Ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose a compromise proposal, including a three-year time limit on the backstop, to the Conservative Party leader.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They will demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings, and insist that the EU will accept the offer to withdraw in limited time.
One Cabinet member said that the Supreme Court's ruling on the closing of the parliament on Tuesday was "a warning," and that "the compromise is the only way we can leave on October 31."
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister shall use whatever is available from his steps.
It is not effective even if it becomes radical, and the Cummings plan clearly fails.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another Cabinet promised Johnson to speak to him to implement the previous Prime Minister, Terryza May, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many that everyone is trying to end this.
If we postpone it, Boris will end, and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering the negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a harsh speech, said: "The prime minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we do not see the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to form an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Whales, and discussing with the people in the streets - as if the election campaign was full-fledged."
The prime minister's spokesman acknowledged yesterday that the agreement was still a long way ahead and said, "If anyone can't make a difference - if they achieve the goal, the road is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben bill, which would force a three-month postponement in case of an unconfirmed withdrawal, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that the bill has hindered our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are trying to continue their progress hard, even though the bill has been passed."
The European Union Delegation Minister Stephen Berkeley returned to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by the TV station boss that he would "not succeed."
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was so nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and to see where the show was broadcast.
I will never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris interviewed the legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scotland branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorraine.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, she presents a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
He added that passion and enthusiasm and curiosity were the key to survival in the television industry, and that the moderator added, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Danbrane shooting incident was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't even think that many of the families of the children who were killed or injured were watching us broadcast the show live from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, personally told me to meet me, so we ended up talking hours at her house.
I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and that "we really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the pain and pain of the web that they do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing the trap.
According to high-ranking government officials, Vice President Konstantino Chiwenga declined the offer of President Robert Mugabe, who had been in the midst of a political change, due to fears that it might be a trap to reclaim military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Chiwenga declined the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was stripped of his administration in a coup, rather than from anxiety, and government officials said on social media.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirms that officials are senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munangawa," it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, tried to contact the envoy to Chiwenga.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three persons.
President Spokesman George Charamba, a senior official of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, said Aaron Nepera and the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Muconoli were involved in the negotiations.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to condemn the African Union's military actions while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to transfer the presidency to the former CDF was not due to the choice of the former president.
"Some of the late president's family began to suffer from fatigue, and it was an abandoned act to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, at least diplomatically, there was a little political aim of the late president to change the flow.
If something destroys the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I would like you to remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would crush the claims of the commanders who claimed to be trapped and not to break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, would decide whether to position it as a coup, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe was forced to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the presidential residence, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
The words "Is Tiri Bemmacwapa Macwapa (which we belong to the camouflage group) " were used in the words of an envoy to convey the desperate message of the president, a powerful metaphor for "if we are not a politician, there is no political competition."
The Army told the other commanders of the region that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coup and successors, Mugabe attempted to reclaim Munagagwa, who had been in short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at the time, South Africans, who were key to this process, refused to intervene, but threatened repeatedly behind it, clarified that the South African army would immediately be sent to Harare if the military had invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources say.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals for nuclear ban ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
【New York Joint】A meeting to aim for a world without nuclear weapons was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 26th, and Mr. Michiko Takeuchi (63), the granddaughter of the director of Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, gave a speech and appealed for support for the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
Five countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and 32 countries and territories were ratified.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern in recent years that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There's nothing to do with it."
China needs strong leadership, and if not, collapse - policy documents
Before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In a white paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast and the domestic situation is complicated, but there is little political issue.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will face division and collapse, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the repression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since late 2012.
Xi also oversaw the modernization of the military, threatening the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export the development model of its own country, nor does it intend to adopt a model of other countries, but rather just seek peace.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the powerful, and war and chaos left a deep scar with that pain; China would never take the pain he had experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never abandon its core interests, nor allow security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"There is no problem with the threat of trade war and the rising tariff," White Paper states.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities, and opening a new world.
China has no idea of countering the U.S., and the U.S. does not want to replace it.
The United States cannot control China, and it is also unlikely that China will stop its development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko.
Yokohama Taka, a famous high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced on August 28, that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as the supervisor and the director (responsibility teacher) will be determined promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local newspaper had a rumor about baseball players.
After hearing the situation from the two students, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the interviews with 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they generally accepted the facts and dismissed them on 28 August.
In the summer of 2003, Motochika WATANABE (74), who was raised by Daisuke MATSUSAKA and others, left Yokohama.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
From the summer of 16 years, he participated in the Koshien Garden in the summer for three consecutive years.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in the autumn, and the Senbatsu tournament in the next spring was hopeless.
The Spice Girls' merc, the eating disorder, and the diet are banned in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, from his experience of eating nothing but fruit and vegetables for many years, admitted that diet was banned at home.
Sporty spices have long been "excessive exercise" without eating well under pressure from members of the global pop group.
Chisom told her that her experience influenced her daughter Scarlett's child-rearing and that "every topic about diet in her home is prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his own appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking to my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, still in front of SNS, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that "bad" comments about himself written in the press led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, I became obsessed with exercise more and more, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Judiciary judgment of same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch made a decision to approve the case in a lawsuit in which 'in fact marriage' (internal marriage) that conforms to marriage could be established even in the same sex.
More than 20 countries recognize same-sex marriage, and there is a system in which local governments, such as Sapporo City, recognize same-sex partnerships, are not legally effective in Japan.
The court ruled that the two women were actually married.
It is considered the first judicial decision to allow same-sex couples to have legal protection.
The same-sex marriage is not allowed due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Registration Law, and a lawsuit is filed in five district courts, including Sapporo.
We would like to deepen our understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss how the legal system should allow diverse families.
Women lived together for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the United States.
The decision was based on the results of the two living together and recognized "the reality that is not the same as marriage between men and women."
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of actual marriage, which has the right to marry in social insurance, etc.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution, which defines marriage as "only based on the mutual agreement."
Both sexes were "unprecedented at the time of the establishment of the same-sex marriage, so the purpose of denying same-sex marriage is not understood."
Although the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, since the same-sex marriage was not recognized, the issue remained that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women."
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while recognizing the same reality as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, 70 percent of people believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a legal spouse, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in the tax system and the lack of joint custody.
In the examination of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriage between same-sex couples but also the expansion of legal rights for actual marriage.
to the trial and jury of former athletes prosecuted for rape
A jury trial was held for former Delaware University baseball players who were accused of sexual assault by multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's life luck.
A 21-year-old woman tells her that she was sexually assaulted after she drove Conaway home.
The two met after three weeks of meeting at Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault the woman.
The defense argued that women's inconsistencies and differences in memory might have regretted having physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure and said, "It's time for the next season to take the pennant." - Yahoo! News
In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final game of this season, and the possibility of his own entry into the CS failed.
In the fourth place, if Hanshin wins the remaining three games, the ranking will be changed.
At the ceremony after the match, Koichi Ogata (50) apologized, "I'm sorry that I couldn't win the final game, and I couldn't confirm my position."

However, after the ceremony, the press asked him about the matter, and he said, "It's not finished yet, it's all."
[Dospo] Ota is the 4th and 20th most self-portrait after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
He became a "returner" to the seniors.
Four times in a single lead, he hit the 20th home run with a liner on the left.
He reached the number of home runs he was aiming for, and he said, "I stopped this number and tried to do it again, and it became a big one."
The director's intention was also firm.
This was the first time a four-year contract was signed.
He said, "I put it in fourth place so that I could swing.
Oda responded to his expectations: "I felt that way, and as a result I entered the game, I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal 4 statues is ABE, a giant who retired from active duty this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads us to victory, and when we get results every day, the 4th of the team is the 4th of the team, and the 4th seniors from the giants were the same."
Among them, "Abe-san's appearance comes to mind the most, he was a reliable person, and he looked at his back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, video clearly
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, Circler Keys, Luna Park, and some famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions can be said to be one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with halves, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes lost by someone, and even animal corpses - all of which are flowing into Sydney Harbour by rainwater.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting waterways.
Coincidentally, the video was released on September 27th, the day of world tourism.
Although its appearance is certainly beautiful, it is one of the most modified and contaminated estuaries of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour is expected to flow into the waterway, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"The heavy rains were falling several times, but Sydney Harbour was ... quite tragic," Dr. Duffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what's there," said Richard Nichols, owner, Dave Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic garbage every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is underneath the water surface), I think everyone will be really excited.
It is overwhelming, but more than half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The remaining half is plastic at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing down the water immediately.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce the amount of plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, coincided with the release of the video, funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of an effort to make Australian citizens aware of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
In the same study, parents also ranked fourth in concerns about plastic waste, and 93 percent of 551 surveyed parents felt increasingly uneasy about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Station was demolished in October | Saga News | Saga Shimbun
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which began demolition work in October, is Futako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The disassembly was used to drain gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
A single chimney is separated from the top by a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine buildings and boilers were not destroyed.
There was also a regrettable voice, and a man in his 60s who ran a restaurant nearby said, "When I look back from afar and see a chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel like I came back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Station began operating in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port, and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Since Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station are nearby, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three people, including nine electric cars, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell their products.
I am now (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Maya Takahashi, a free announcer and commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," talked about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save me.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is more like a teacher than a father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
It is different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do it, and what is important as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was struck by the fact that I was called "cone" or "busaik," my father said, "If I thought it was "cone, but I didn't think it was."
Then, around the second or third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty female anna can do it," and even when I didn't get motivated because I didn't want to do the job I wanted to do, and my heart was rotten, "Anyone can do the work hard."If that happens, I asked Mama to do it, but I was glad to be in charge of it.
i learned naturally from my father's acting.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but in fact, since I joined the TV station, I've always been exposed to the news through the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when I read the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe was happy and confident that he was "good at reading Mama news."
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sense.
It has been cultivated through watching father's stage, film, television, and period dramas in childhood.
To put it more, I think that my father's work on variety shows and how to deal with them is thanks to various experiences of my childhood.

In the workshop, members of the OB Association of the Ryukyu Performing Arts Department of the Prefectural University of Arts introduced the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing three lines, koto, taiko, kokyu and flute.
The host was from Miyakojima City, and Mr. Kawamata of the OB Association, who introduced the charm of kumidori.
In this workshop, I learned about the three components of kumidori (music, chant, Ryukyu dance) and how five kinds of musical instruments are expressed in dance.
It was explained that the three lines were an element of the movement and emotional expression of the characters along with the songs, and that the kokyu was pulled up by singing and playing the melody of the three lines.
In the second half, the students actually touched the instrument and felt the tone, and felt the charm of the instrument.
This is the first time in Miyako, with the aim of becoming familiar with Ryukyu classical music through musical instruments and getting interested in many students about kumidori.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
It is the first edition of the New York Times (New York) - Yahoo!
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round was held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18 cards.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship (WRC) is one of the four world championships in which the International Automobile Federation (FIA) manages, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, it has been the world's highest rally championship with history and tradition, and the competition is said to be the toughest car competition because it runs not only on closed roads (paved roads), but also on various roads such as gravel roads and snow roads at high speeds.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparation Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation, decided to hold the 2020 WRC Japan Round.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with relevant parties to ensure that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Japan as the center of motorsports representing Japan and that it will be a big event to appeal to the world.
Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports competition for this prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all here."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motorsports, commented on the Japan Round.
The Japan round of the WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Shitara Town) and Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City, Ena City).
The main venue is "Love - Global Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
The Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is it the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment - open a breakthrough where researchers may have a major reform to treat patients.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurred in Tasmania Devil and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will create new ways to treat cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmania Devil and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for the cancer.
It may be the key to addressing deadly face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags would no longer respond to markers due to camflage using a series of proteins called PRC2, and the immune system would not attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
Peter McCallum researcher Mark Dawson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Traditional treatments may be reused to reactivate markers, or proteins known as MHC, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"There is a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where similar cases of cancer cells escape detection.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process occurs in humans and Tasmanian devils," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if a drug that is effective in humans could be used in Tasmanian devils, it could help control the tumor."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-type planets orbit around a small star called Red dwarf, 30 light years from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas planet GJ3512b orbiting its main star, Red dwarf, was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our Solar System.
Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, who led this research published in Science, said.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet and only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 °C / 3527 °C).
That's why I have a reddish color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales stated that the third planet could have been released from its stellar system in the past, and that it could explain its elliptical orbit.
Planets are produced from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which created the star itself orbiting.
In the most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, the object is formed from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes atmospheric due to the attraction created by the egg of the planet.
A conflict model called a self-gravity instability model may explain this unusual planetary system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature was lower," Morales said.
In this state, the disk becomes unstable, so some dense areas may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant bean dip, and a coworker
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating a dip of beans with a wake-up to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of the transfer of methane fetamine, a Class B felony, and suspected of taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit obtained from OregonLive.com, a suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach got worse and her legs were fluffy.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have contained methane phetamine in the beans dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said that Medina Hernández "was told the victim's food that he had put drugs," while the third employee said that the suspect had sent a message that he had accidentally put methane fetamine into the beans dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows Medina Hernández turning his camera back and clinginging behind the microwave, but taking something out of the brazier.
It is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put a dip in a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff, at present, did not think there were customers who had contaminated food.
Medina Hernández was detained in Marion County prison instead of a bail of $5.2 million.
According to The Smoking Gunn, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of felony by assault, robbery, supplication, transfer of methane phetamine, theft, possession of methane phetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Asks can be organized" President of JR Tokai, attach importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on 27th, President Shin Kaneko of JR Tokai reiterated his stance on early construction, stating that "it is better to separate the issues discussed with Shizuoka Prefecture that should not be organized before starting construction and what should be done after starting construction."
More specifically, he said, "We will talk at the meeting and at the front."
Mr. Kaneko said, "When we organize all the problems, it's not easy to start construction, and I think it's possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea."
The prefecture is concerned that the spring water that went into the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that "If there is something practical, I think it is difficult to think from the safety side of construction."
He denied that the route change mentioned by Governor Kawakatsu Hirata was "not possible."
Mr. Kaneko pointed out three locations in Minami Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station as a place that takes a particularly long time for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Administrative and Social News|Saga Shimbun
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required reorganization and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced their hospital name on June 26.
The percentage of 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture is 38 and 5%, the tenth highest in the country, and three have already been consolidated and relocated.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Taramachi Tara Hospital, Fujitsu County.
Among them, Takyu Municipal Hospital and Kojo Municipal Hospital are planning to build a new hospital in Higashi-Takyu-cho, Takyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating surplus in recent years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi stressed that "As a town, we have the idea to operate alone and cooperate with hospitals in neighboring towns, and hospitals must be left absolutely for residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The administrative director of Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "We don't hear the contents from the prefecture," and concluded that "We will actively participate in the regional medical planning coordination meeting of the prefecture and respond to it based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Organization for Promotion of Regional Medical Functions (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not a mechanical decision to determine the direction of public hospitals, but rather a request to review them again at regional medical planning meetings in each prefecture."
"We would like to hear from the parties about the future operation of the hospital.
In some cases, it may be necessary to review medical subjects and to further reduce the sickbed."

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise and frequent use of the Royal Navy aircraft
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use private machines that move royal families around the world for important events and appearances.
Of course, there is a privilege to have a private aircraft.
There is no limit to the number of baggage, and the Royal Family seems to be able to invite guests, including unexpected passengers.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, only Queen and Prince Philip are frequent customers of royal aircraft.

Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, like most important royal customers, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggy Dog Privileges are famous, and it is not surprising to request that she want to take her pet to travel with her.
Queen Elizabeth is said to have loved dogs since childhood and had more than 30 coggie dogs even after she became queen.
In 2007, he had five dogs: Monty, Emma, Linette, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, five Cockerspaniel vists, oxo, flash, pick, and spans, as well as four ciders, berry vulcan, and candy mix dogs, Daxfunt and Koggy.
The staff on the Royal Aircraft will be busy.
The royal staff were seen asking them to leave the dog on the lawn before boarding, and Seals continued.
I've never had an accident before.
The show also found that her luggage during her public service trip was known for shocking amounts.
According to the Narrator, "The Queen's luggage was 12 tons on a 44,000-mile British federal tour in 1953."
It can be understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
But the queen is not the only one who loves fashion.
The wife of the Marquis of Cambridge is also said to have a unique taste when carrying her own clothes, and she is said to have one seat per dress.

Trump Hotel owner complained about the suitability, but also retained the liquor sales license.
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Commission has dismissed Washington's appeal that Washington should review the local Trump International Hotel's license to sell alcoholic beverages because of its owner's questionability.
On Wednesday, three MPs, two former judges and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on the state law that requires the applicant's "suitability" to obtain a liquor license.
In the first appeal submitted in the summer of last year, he accused President Trump of assault and repeated fraud, claiming he violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the license was already approved.
This was the second time a petition was issued to update the permit.
The honey collected by Bentley's Flying Bees is the first harvest!
How is the taste of honey collected by Flying Bees bred at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September of the same year.
More than 100 bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the premises of a factory that assembles cars?
I want to taste this!
Bentley's honey is here (11 pieces)
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing division, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers watched the bees from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains as they were gathering honey from various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been engaged in a wide range of activities through its Crew Plant and our business to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers.
The staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of bentra honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to play our role." In May 2019, 1.2 million bees of honeybees "Flying Bees" were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator, and after filtering the fallen honey, it was bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with a Bentley-like commitment.
The label was designed by Louise McCallum, the designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we also want to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey such as scones.
The Cleveland Police, a series of scandalous reports, is the worst in Britain.
A police officer who followed the scandal was declared the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
According to the Cleveland Police, "heavy deterioration" continues.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley of the Police Directorate said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Mike Wiel, Chief of Police, resigned in January less than a year before his inauguration, but was investigated for "deep" his actions, but for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Lieutenant Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee of the Illegal Act on the grounds that he had done sexual acts to his colleagues.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Interior Ministry intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am fully responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr was "criminal," and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what will happen.
At present, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate," Pelosi told CNN in Congress.
"We're going to do what we're doing, based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Wolodymyr Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor Rudi Giulani.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security lawyer in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before the formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of political financing violations.
In response to Barr's question of whether to testify, Pelosi said Friday that he would decide who the Special Intelligence Committee would call for witnesses.
However, Pelosi added that he thought he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's name for the Secretary of Justice in the July telephone talks with the Ukrainian president.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision regarding the disposition of this accusation.
Pelosi said he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower who became the source of information when Trump attacked the whistleblower as a spy on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
The president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi spoke of the alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political gain, and announced that Trump would formally impeach him.
The call content is contained in the accusations released on Thursdays, and internal whistleblowers claim that Trump abused his office in the next 2020 presidential election to "see for intervention" in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-grade computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian bentheke, speed violation prohibited driving
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was arrested for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old forward admitted on January 20, that he had driven his Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 limit speed in Richmond, southwest London.
The Belgians then took a speed violation camera in March at Patney, south-west London, driving 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek was convicted of the two violations under a single trial procedure in which one of the magistrates tried and sentenced to light crimes.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the judging committee
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Cécondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the next GFA election review committee.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davis and expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In his interview with GNA Sport, Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the results of the review process, and that it was fair or doubtful to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside the previous interests, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his relationship with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis of Corporate Governance Consultants, and Mr. Marian Barnoa of Corporate Governance Consultants and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwar of Corporate Governance Consultants.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Appocavi, sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage to be "at least 1,000 yen."
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the planned number was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and only 30% for non-regular employees.
The number of companies who answered "approved" was 100 percent, construction (70,6%) and wholesale (61,7%).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink, and accommodation.
The representative of the conference said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries where part-time workers are often paid."
An average of 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, there were 61.3% of regular employees, 54.5% of mid-term employees, and 15.4% of non-regular employees.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (37.5%) and the construction industry (24.1%, 38.1%) struggled.
As a result, 86.4% of the total number of applicants had problems in hiring, and in many cases the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (in three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy answered, "I already admit."
Including 20 and 3% of the "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total showed acceptance.
The number of companies that "disapproved" was 64.4%, with construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%), and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) answered.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tipplick said that Wales will host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins the Walladeds, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will probably be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory over Wales was the 14th victory, Tiprick and his team would be a straight line against England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to try and win at the top of the group and end," said Tiprick, a Welsh Franker.
Until now, the fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last fall.
Australia thinks it's a lot of blame to return the loan, but it's time to try to win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And now I'm here, and now it's a real show.
Wales had only one victory over Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa in the previous World Cup.
Under the supervision of Warren Gutland, the total score for the Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight 3 team was 7 out of 41.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was included in several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
I'm sure the game was tough, maybe, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
To win Wales, the key is the Australian combination of Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Law, and the Breakdown Battle with Tiplic.
Tiprick, who has played 67 international matches so far, has been fighting several matches or both players in the past, and knows exactly what they are waiting for.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you will be facing a tough game from now on.
They are always the best in the world.
I am fully aware of what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the world's most defensive backs players, and Michael is an aggressive backsman, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when necessary.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself rather than confronting such a strong background.
I want to fight the best one, and if I play against the two, I have to keep up with myself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose.

In East Enders, the column highway (Tony Clay) was surprised by Whitney Dean's sudden bomb news, so the column would return to the mistress, and the hot tension between the column and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowen) would soon explode.
But will the relationship between the two begin or will you regret this hot moment?

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from comedians?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by the black sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said in a press conference on July 22 that "the company has no talent at 9 and no such thing at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the ratio of "9:1," it would be considered that there was a gift from comedians to Yoshimoto, and investors who were paying taxes were also tweeted on Twitter.
If Galla's share was "9:1," would there be a gift tax?
I heard from Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen is "9:1," then Kichimoto Kogyo will earn 1 million yen in sales and 1 million yen in expenses.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, we should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
Also, even if you think about the allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price far away from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as this time, a third party will not be able to decide on the amount of tax-appropriate prices for those transactions that both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen's payment statement is a pity.
[Interviewing Cooperation Tax Attorney] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working at a bank, he registered as a tax accountant in 2008 (five subjects: bookkeeping, financial statements, corporate tax law, income tax law, inheritance tax law).
University lecturers, seminars, and writing work are wide.
It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for accounting beginners.
the white house, a panic without impeachment.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, explaining that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be increasing "awareness, anxiety, and concern" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't think it's true."
The White House officials were joking that there was no clear plan for this situation, or that the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied, so there was no confidence in how to proceed because this claim was so serious.
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's unwavering response to the impeachment was likely to increase the likelihood of being "incompetent."
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised every day, and some close associates of the president are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable actions and concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means have spurred him to be concerned about the president and politics in the election year environment.
In his presidential term, Trump faced the greatest threat ever before, and revived his strategy during Robert Moller's Russian investigation that he considered effective.
Trump tried to lighten the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of whistleblowers as they were motivated by factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the Morale trials, but this time they are beginning to feel the difference.
The president, whose powers are branded, seemed to be attending a press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that the damage can be mitigated, arguing that it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information about the controversial Trump and Vladimir Zerensky and the Ukrainian president.
Moreover, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategy close to the White House points out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and that the impeachment will not have much effect on new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with legislative proposals and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "there is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President for the next four months."
Another sources stated that those claiming impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how uncertain the response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to an official who explained the plan, this initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented and what kind of measures will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum that the publication and publication of critical internal accusations had given the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible, such as the statement that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin would not be able to publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later.
The current pressure is expected to increase from the time of Robert Morler's investigation, who has only spoken out in a few cases.According to the person involved in the case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump, and Corrie Luwandouski, who served as the head of the former electoral ward.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never talked to the president or close adviser about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left the White House, and Pat Sipolon, the current White House legal advisor, lacked this experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
Details of the White House's strategy are generally aware that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but that they need to be organized and able to lead all of their collective efforts and political struggles.

"The final part of Natsuzora was over, and it was over for half a year, but I thought it was a good ending with a good feeling that it was well organized.I was also tired of the performers and production staff again, and it was good for Utchan's narration saying that it would continue to be the 101st Dora."
In addition, in the final episode, "It's lonely that you can't see natsuzo from next week, grandpa, thank you for half a year," "I miss you from tomorrow."

I was able to have a boyfriend, but due to his work, I was able to have a long distance romance ...
I was told to marry someday, but I couldn't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation with our allies to marriage?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice derived from detailed data analysis is essential.
what's this?
I am worried whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during a long-distance relationship.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I have work and my family, but his work place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, administrative office)
The couple who got married from a distant love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (--) C is in a distant relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested at a distance and the two become stronger," but in the first place, is long distance love going well?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) Speaking of distance love, a survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous, but according to the data, only 16% of couples from distance love to marriage.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the other person (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touch sensation), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It can be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to the other person's house, you will be burdened with time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if it is a holiday to heal the tiredness of the work, the body is kata.
I feel refreshed when I go home.
Does that mean we have to break apart when we get far away?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure without having to meet frequently or a couple who have decided to stay away in advance.
You'll be engaged a year later, or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you do not see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
Thursday, in a comment defending the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive of the House of Representatives Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had requested to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukrainian suspicions were "grotesque shows" created by the leftists and their media assets.
"The Democrats of this special commission negotiated with the Ukrainians to obtain Trump's nude photographs."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After Congressman Nunes' scolding ended, Huffpost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democrats were trying to find the truth.
The only response I've ever been to is the Connecticut Democratic House of Representatives Jim Heims, but many other members are questioning whether the answer is a red-naked truth.
Memediate.com speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that are said to have been written in the controversial steel document.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, in a room in a hotel in Moscow where Trump is said to be watching prostitutes urinate, referring to the "sleeping tape" that suggests existence.

Potential reduction of exhaust gas in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only aircraft to fly in the sky that cannot reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agricultural and Bioenvironmental Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude oil-based fuels, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The achievement of this technology in the first generation is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technologies tend to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is something like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as biofuel for jets.
The first is a low-risk approach, which requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that are already partially developed to maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler described the second option: "You can try it with a reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a 25 million US production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not high for fuel transport and production.
"As a technologist," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decisions made after the explanation.

Boris Johnson's camp warned that Britain would face riots like Los Angeles if Brexit was overturned.
A senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson said he needed to "enhage anger" against the political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but insisted that the term "defeat" would not be used.
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain calm, one minister told Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gile Joan or the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country simply because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to be innocent.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstrators with eye-catching yellow vests are causing confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be catastrophic.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time until tens of thousands of people go to the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum had overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to hold a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to have been facing a House of Representatives rebellion, calling for lower demands on EU withdrawal and instead to hit the EU in a compromise.

pakistan, brother of social media celebrity, was sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the incident fades.
"It's too long for people to forget," said Farzana Bali, a female rights activist and founder of the first gender department in Pakistan's university, adding that it took more than three years to solve even the most popular Baroch case.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honorary murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much higher than that, because it is estimated that about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings of honor-based violence monitoring organizations worldwide every year are occupied by Pakistan.
Anti-pork cholera measures 1.3 billion yen To add to the September supplementary plan in Shizuoka Prefecture (Magyo Shimbun) - Yahoo!

Floods and disruptions caused by prolonged monsoons in many parts of India
The Monsoon season in India has been prolonged for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken in early September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37% higher than usual.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues for a few days, Monsoon will weaken during the last few decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, the buildings collapsed due to heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
The houses were flooded, and the inhabitants were watered to their knees and crossed the street, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Raknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
For farmers, prolonged monsoons are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon at this time.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables will rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak Monsoon.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dashera on 8 October, where the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, the evil smiling figure of a beard-boom appearing in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if the monsoon pulls long, then the last laugh may be Lavana.
[Sendai] Defeat Yokohama M with a compact defense Director Watanabe (Sport Hochi) - Yahoo! News
J1 Begalta Sendai held a private practice for 24 to 4 days (only 20 minutes at the beginning) for the 28th Battle of Home Yokohama M (at 7:00 p.m., Utah).
Yokohama M lost 15 points in the last three games of the league, but Shin Watanabe (45) responded by saying, "The players showed me a powerful, battle-like exercise."
Last season, the club lost eight games in the home game of Clubworth, losing five in the enemy territory.
It is a difficult enemy to lose in 1-2 this season.
Yokohama M is currently ranked 14th in Sendai, with 48 points in the league.
In addition to the 13-point FW Marcos Juniol (26), 10-point 7-assisted FW Nakakawa Teruto (27) and other strong front players, J's leading CB combination of Japan's DF Hatakenaka Makinosuke (24) and Shunto Brazilian DF Chiago Multins (24) awaits.
Watanabe said, "There are plenty of aggressive play in and out, there are also speed CBs, we want to protect compactness and fight with confidence without seeing tear."

exposure to a large amount of pesticides and increased risk of heart disease and heart attack
Current studies have shown that working near high concentrations of pesticides may lead to increased risk of heart disease.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
In comparison to male groups that did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"This study highlights the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women or other races because it only targets Japanese Americans.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within ten years of exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and heart attack in work is no longer important," said Dr. Rodriguez.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to the aging of the population and hiding the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone meeting
The impeachment procedure for U.S. President Donald Trump was a dramatic week on Washington's political issue.
For political beginners Vladimir Zerensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump telephone problem so far, and whether Zerensky has a wide range of effects?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's 100 percent claim is controversial.
Zelensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for support received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the EU's support including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Voytica, said: "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scrutinized military aid and asked Zerensky to investigate two rather than one, one against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the other on the server of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is uncertain whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone.
Thanks to the announcement of the call, I would like to thank the people who helped me."
Zelensky will meet Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled for October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana with an interim rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Organization's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was recognized by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO on safety at airports and in their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's long-running zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for safety evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Aroti, Director of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada to Nii Icoi Otou, and Director of Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Bennard Aliou stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to keep in mind that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Adah also said that this award complements the sector's inconsistency and perseverance, and is a gift of Ghana's efforts.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump and Peter Gino are appointed as FEMA Chiefs: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Senate Committee in Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Secretary of FEMA, was the deputy director of government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been vacant since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, decided that Mr. Long had illegally used government vehicles to commute to work between Washington and his home, Norcarorina.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, raised suspicions that he was drunk and involved in a riot, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of this month.
Mr. Gaynor's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Authority in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of butanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found in an office building located at 9600 blocks on Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found equipment to pack the beep cartridge.
"This process is very dangerous," said Cano.
Capt. Cano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigations, and that there was a possibility of a fire in the process of extracting oil used for the beep product.
"The static electricity from clothes alone can fire, and since it is concentrated, it will cause not only fires but also explosions," said Lieutenant Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away as well as a fire one after another.
The dangerous goods processing team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
An anonymous information was received and it led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still trying to figure out who the illegal Beip campaign is.
The police said that Zhang himself believed that the office had a store in the office because the office was empty.
As the investigation continued, the police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to prevent illegal bating products from appearing again.
"I don't know whether it's real or not," he said.
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a significant impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to get close to these activities.
In the middle of the concert there was a 6-strong earthquake!
Evacuation training at the Hall of Miyazaki City - Yahoo!
In anticipation of an earthquake during the concert, a practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City.
This training is held every year.
On stage, a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department is actually performed, and it is assumed that a seismic intensity of 6 strong will occur along the way of the song.
About 300 people participated in the training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff.

The lost dress of Elizabeth I, displayed at Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver leaf threads, and lavish embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Elery Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, has decided to be one.
This faded piece of cloth, hung on a wall of a small church in one rural area, is said to have been placed there 100 years ago and is considered to be part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally found this luxurious cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at Hampton Court Palace, near exactly where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
The only remaining part of the 16th century dress is that it was an important discovery of the entire royal dress collection.
Although there was no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of her sleeves, a three-year study found that the dress was not part of the royal possession.
The "silver silk cloth" which is extremely expensive was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but the embroidery of plants and flowers of the "name" quality also suggests that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later was noble.
The dress was probably the equivalent of a Tudor mansion at the time of its creation.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rival wearing such luxury clothing would not have been able to endure it.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
Everyone was always happy to say, "It's amazing" when they looked at the cloth, and I was convinced that they were watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of a piece of dress that was cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton is not as expected.
Baxton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and the local legend says that the cloth has long been associated with Parry.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley before Elizabeth died in 1603.
Over 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on very delicate hand-sewing altar cloths, will be displayed next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The vast space as much as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and led by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you feel really respect for the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the front and back, you will find a very important respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched" A week after the missing female child, the Self-Defense Force withdrew The volunteer male is also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces (SDF) closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for Kokura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village called for the withdrawal of the Self-Defense Forces as "the scope of the request has been searched."
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk such as mountain slopes and Sawa.
Also, on the 27th, I was unable to find the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search.
The police and firefighters will continue their search from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral speech by Miyazaki - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters were seeking to invalidate the election.
As a result of the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for the invalidation of the election because the value of the vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member was the lowest in Japan in July.
In the first oral speech held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was inequalities and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the Defendant's prefectural election management committee asked for a rejection of the bill, saying, "It should not be said that the issue of unconstitutionality was in a significant inequalities, but should be constitutional."
The judgment will be passed on October 30.

Arriving at the space station, an unmanned supply machine caught with a robotic arm | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
Konotori No. 8, an unmanned supply vehicle that arrived at the International Space Station.
The station's robotic arm extends from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th.
On the night of the 28th, the unmanned spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) of about 400 km altitude, arrived near the station, and the astronauts during their stay operated the robotic arm and caught it.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the difference in speed and approaches about 10 meters away.
The robot arm length of 17 and 6 meters is the flow that grabs the supply machine.
The aircraft had about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching it to the station, the flight attendants carry luggage.
he's involved in one third of the american drug
Shortly after the sunrise of Chicago West Side, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in daylight.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of overdose.
McNight said that "probably 90 percent" of the drug was brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king Nemecio Cervantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Matthew Donahew DEA, executive officer in Mexico, said, "Mencho is DEA and, indeed, the top-prior of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forests of El Mencho were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva, is involved in at least a third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel has sold "massive" cocaine, methane phenyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobility unit.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho does not punish and defends his empire.
In recent years, thousands of murders have been caused by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occur a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the solder.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively take away the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news release, PS4 game in the old days
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, a sequel to the Last of As.
A part of the video game Puy, with a sense of urgency, was also presented to fans.
A few days after the Last of As2 announcement, further details were announced.
Sony and Noty Dog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
Since the PS1 era, the Last of As Part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous one, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell stories with so many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved to that extent.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all the other sections started."
The game was very grand and did not enter a single Blu-ray, and it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
Although it doesn't want to ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic notydog works.
When the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
In October 2019, Sony recently announced a free PS4 game for PlayStation Plus, including the aforementioned Notty Dogs.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replica, and the bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notojima Travel Sales "Save" Council Try Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, the Notoshima Regional Development Council (Notoshima Regional Development Council) was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings, and food crossed the Susomachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
Some of the products were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents asked for continued "help" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including general vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even elderly people who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiro gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Susomachi-kai, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't think it would sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
The user also ordered "I want you to have coffee that you can flip by yourself, not canned coffee."
The council will consider what was requested.
There is currently only one convenience store in Noto Island where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to help "shopping weak."
By December, the 20 community meetings in the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to add about $100 million to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers suffering from droughts have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been greatly reviewed to simplify them.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be allocated to the drought-affected community support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to $100 million of drought relief funds for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted over $7 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife's family in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen, Katie Stay, and four of his five children.
Haskell said on July 9, 2014, he was pushed into the residence of Stay and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old son, 9 and 7 years old daughter died.
Only one of his family, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but then completely recovered.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's claim of innocence.
The jury was dismissed until Monday's trial.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook her voice with anger echoed by the leaders of each country.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg addressed the issue of strengthening measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and irritability protested all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people attended in over 150 countries.
Morioka also marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will be launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to 1/5.
All participating countries shall take measures specified by each country without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is pointed out to be related to global warming in various places.
In order to achieve global warming at a fast pace, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit, which was realized by the call of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal to virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new targets, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy includes zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century.
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's efforts at the environmental meeting, said at a meeting on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The unconstitutional wound would be nothing more than a "replacement of issues" that the person himself counters.
There is no longer a grace to address global warming, and the international community has to deal with the common crisis of humanity in a timely manner.
It can not be effective enough if the efforts of each country are limited.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act to avoid taking away the future.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The results of the U.S. Army's research have led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and timekeeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Distributed Quantum Information Center of the Army Research Institute of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and measured in one, even if the other quantum bits are physically far away, the measurement results in the other are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, an experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distances.
Researchers say that this dispersion of entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing large-scale distributed entangling," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
The enthanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions and excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
The team then sent the light particles through a non-linear crystal with a strong laser.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nm, the optimal value of long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
In the measurement results, atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of entangled networks in long-distance atomic clocks.
The large entangled clock network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate position measurement, navigation, and time-keeping applications."
