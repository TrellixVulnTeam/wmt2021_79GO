Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina and protested the Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in the town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the Turgovska Gola barracks and to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," and "Don't stop it firmly."
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grad, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko nuclear power plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will hold discussions next week to discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or to pay for the cost of the waste of Croatia that Slovenia would be treated at newly constructed facilities.
Croatian Minister of Environmental Protection and Energy, Tomislav Chorich, told the announcer that Croatia is also suffering from public waste disposal from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would Bosnian pants pocket, or Turkovska gola, be the best place in Croatia?"

PayPay salesman "I'm on the Wave" "I'm on the Wave" Cashless to happen "I'm on the Wave" I wonder if the waves will swell (Tokai TV) - Yahoo!
Tax increase starting in October.
In line with this, the country will start the cashless point reduction project.
Reducing up to 5% to reduce the coldness of consumption is "cashless."
[See in the image] just before the tax hike... stores, businesses, and cashless introductions.
So what's happening now is "introduction."
This is a cashless store that was previously a cash business.
We were close to the installation site.
[Cashlessing] immediately before the tax hike
"Okakiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular shop operated by Takeshin Seika, and there are more than 100 kinds of oysters and arashi in the store.
On this day, Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users, visited Tatsushin.
PayPay Yasuda: "Is there any payment method other than cash now?
Mr. Shinmi, President of Takeyoshi Co., Ltd.: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it's easier than cash if I get used to it because it's no longer possible to receive the tsurisen, so I think it's easier to rotate the cash register."
To date, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce 20% of the usage by points.
Mr. Yasuda has been increasing the number of users explosively, but Mr. Yasuda is a salesman who sells the introduction of PayPay to customers, i.e., stores.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also heard from Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's a peak now, and if you can't talk about it before you jump in, or if you can do a consumer return business together, you can listen to it by PayPay and register a member, and I'm riding a wave now quite fine."
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the national consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves in Japan's Consumer Reducing Business.
As a result of the consumption tax hike in October, the government introduced a system to reduce the maximum amount of shopping to consumers by 5% to prevent the cooling of consumption.
As in "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before tax increases.

What is Münchhausen syndrome, the representative of Netflix's The Politicians?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are sick.
The Politician is broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, the president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwyneth Parthrow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, despite the fact that the person under that protection is not seriously ill.
There are many different types of diseases, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is suspected to be a disease of himself.
However, the surrogate Munchhausen syndrome implies that others who are clearly protected are ill.
This is also known as FII, a type of child abuse.
Although it is a rare symptom, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following points as a precaution.
The child is healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make the child feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Excessively administering drugs and other drugs to cause disease symptoms.
How general is Muhnhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that 89 cases of 100,000 people had occurred in two years.
what should we do if we suspect damage to our children?

Nigeria: Police raids on caduna schools, rescue 300 children
Kaduna - The State Police of Kaduna yesterday arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
Police said the children were inhumane, but the school denied this claim.
Residents calling themselves the school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
Parents came to deliver meals to their children every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were in.
I was very surprised that the police came and evacuated the children, and the parents took all the food they had delivered, and then closed the school.
There are parents who can testify to whether the police had put children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair."
He adds that Abduraman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Corran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhumane environment.
Many children had a scar on their back.
So we are investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Pope, warning IT representatives that AI development is based on public interests
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats and investors on Friday that if there was no ethical assessment of public interest, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference, where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
In the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions on the potential and dangers of artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work, and at the same time, case studies were conducted on gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and the responses of social media companies during the atrocities.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if he relied too much on robotics to pursue profits, he would be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
The Pope warned, "If technology advances cause increasingly prominent inequality, it would not be the right true progress."
If human so-called technological progress is hostile to public interest, unfortunately, it will be counterproductive to a certain kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they would like to use the expertise of the participants in the conference to find the future counsel of the Catholic Church on the high-tech field.

Martín Woodegor gave a surprise assist to Michel O'Yarsabar.
Real Madrid beat Ossana at 2-0, breaking the record for the domestic season and making it the top spot in La Liga.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, the pressure seemed to have reached the limit of patience.

Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When the lawsuit came in contact, Sharad Powerle's name was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank Fraud incident involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Office (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew, Ajit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an Executive Bureau report comparable to the first police report was registered by the Central Authority.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit came into contact, the name Sharad Powerle was nowhere.
An executive lawsuit and suspicion that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "only they know how Sharad's name emerged or who referred it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud case, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this incident."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that he had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the October 21 Maharashtra parliamentary election.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, stating that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
The NCP called the action by the Executive Bureau a political summary.

Stepping the accelerator pedal eliminates accidents!
Four Advanced Supplies - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driver error.
In particular, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistakes by elderly drivers is on an increasing trend.
In particular, when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes a panic, and sometimes the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
A new car with a safety driver support function is introduced to cover such a mistake, but there are also rearing equipment that can be attached to an unattended car.
This system is designed and sold by after-sales parts manufacturers.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform you of pedal mistakes from a new perspective.
It is to avoid pedal mistakes with "an alarm sound."
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
It is said that the acceleration is avoided by reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are deaf to hear.
It is attached to the OBDII connector, and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excl. tax) and it is affordable, and it is also attractive that the setting is necessary.
[Ashimo Watching Kun] The World Wing launched its launch in mid-September with the Ashimo Watching Kun, an accelerator and brake step prevention device.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
When the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped in from the stop (and less than 10Km/h), the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected and the accelerator opening is suppressed electrically.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantly control the sudden start by turning it into a creep driving state (the state of leaving the brake in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to switch to creep state.
The mounting can only be done with caperon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Mayor Nakamura said, "I am surprised that I haven't been to the whole Toba citizen yet, and I want to continue my exchanges of mind in the future."
[Saga Torrential rain disaster, what happened at that time... sharing mothers' experiences while raising children | Saga News
"The Shiraishi Town Parenting Support Circle Haguhagu" (Representative of Tomoko Tanaka) opened a discussion on how to share experiences and lessons from the heavy rain disaster in Saga at Ariake Public House in Banda, town on July 27.
About 20 mothers who are raising children think about the form of disaster prevention suitable for each family, and summarize their awareness and requests for local governments.
Ms. Saori Kusumoto (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked the nursery school suddenly lost their desire to go to the nursery school after the flood, and they began to stay overnight.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up their homes and have not had enough time to face them," he said.
Yukari Ogushi (36) in Shiraishi Town spent a night at the evacuation shelter town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
He said, "If you have a child who can't stay still, you will use your mind around you."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water around her house.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the event of a disaster with food and simple toilets.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family composition and housing."
Shinako Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a child of 6 and 8 years old, proposed that " elementary school had a closed school e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or mail system.
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "It was okay last time."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
President Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as an organization."
Relations between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri Contact the police agency
The IOPC will examine whether Prime Minister Johnson should investigate whether a scandal in London's mayor's office violates criminal law.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts concerning acts" on suspicion that Mr. Arcuri had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists in the presence of information indicating that a crime could have been committed," says GLA.
This has never been proven.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations made by the English and Welsh police.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to that of the Chief of Police.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, while claiming that he was "unconvinced."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but the press said that the Americans who emigrated to London seven years ago had received preferential treatment from the Mayor of London for £126,000 from public money and three times to participate in foreign trade dispatches with Johnson.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 to the hacker house, the company of Urcuri, under investigation.
The company will be asked puzzled questions about the investigation process before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the phone numbered was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arcuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessman was "public secret among the staff."
The move of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory authority touched the anger of the Prime Minister's official residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"In any case, the supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence, and the prime minister has not given an opportunity to answer the supervisory authority before the news reports issued late Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will see the political kyogen that was created by amasama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Tourism and Regional Promotion Division, was "public secret."
The former London and Partners (L&P) staff stated that although there were people who considered the company "untrustworthy" at that time, Arcuri had the privilege of attending trade-related talks abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo!
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the past 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, many people's thoughts and efforts have been made in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the people involved, not just the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property for ordinary people."
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from anxiety about money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operations do not yield results unless they walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the bursting of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we understand the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
We believe that this was the reason why we became a long-term fund for 20 years and that we continued to be a direct sales system that delivered messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc. miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling fake tablets of oxychodon containing fenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had in September last year before he accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Levis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against individual cases.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutor in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the start of the trial because of the high likelihood of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip-hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke out in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video to his Instagram and published a song called "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died in 2016 due to drug overdose and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen instead of Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games for nineyearolds in Nigeria
These nine-year-olds are using a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hidden game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, animations and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
The player gets points when they catch a bat from a hiding place.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that "we spend time building games when we're bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in numerous mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was too obsessed with the game, so I was a bit angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but what if I make a game myself so that others can play it?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care about it."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, gives the game its name as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is made, young people like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded the award by creating robots that use program code to isolate household chores.
In May, Akrobo, a female high school team from Ghana, won the 2019 Robofest Contest.
Google and Microsoft giant technology companies are investing in Africa, and Basil and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to court documents submitted on Friday, it is likely that former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely testifyed to federal agents investigating corruption in major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the factual document does not specify which sin Hayes admits.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecution sued former legislator Hayes for involvement in the insurance company's plan to fund the state's insurance director's campaign.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated over $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindbergh supported Republican ideas and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked him to comment by e-mail on Friday, but he did not reply.
On Friday, Hayes' Defendant, Carnes Davis, also called for additional comments by email, but did not respond.
The court documents filed on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken to Cosey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes actually spoke with the State Insurance Supervisor about a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecution said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cosey, and that he had a direct bribe with his supervisor.
The indictment, published in April, claims that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to hold up to $2 million for Cosey's 2020 reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported suspected attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them out.
Cozy has no doubts.
The indictment states that in a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cosey, Lindbergh co-owners instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cosey's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially refuted that he would pay attention if he did so much money, but was eventually broken in the conversation.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office of Public Prosecutors requested an email to provide detailed information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the happiness of users, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like to post others!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and only posts can be seen.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia policy director Mia Garrick said that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who consider the number of happy surveys and likes to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had a very positive feedback from many bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
It only removes numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange, rather than the number of likes and reactions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more securely than they feel competitive.
Garrick said that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights they've accessed so far.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test is conducted, and it is premature to say that tests are conducted in the same way.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when this test will end or will remain unchanged.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has very aggressive "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram users.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!News
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If my favorite bag is broken, I want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was Cando's handicraft parts that helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying, i'm not selling anymore.
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petitpla product.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main unit greatly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for what changed to this connected fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver color.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
Originally it seems to be a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at the end of the bag handle, and we bought two pieces.
The size of the ring is small, but if you line it up with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is very attached.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So I decided to make a ring in two pairs.
The metal fittings were increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight was not a problem at all.
Rather, I feel that more exciting parts have been added to the design level.
Aso, the express train of the JNR, is a temporary train, Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours journey | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28th
People who enjoy a special train trip inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era
A temporary train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train that connected Kumamoto and Tokyo between 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, the tour was organized by Japanese travelers.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo, Chikuho and Kagoshima lines.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother was sentenced to life imprisonment for the honor murder of kandir burochi, a social media star in pakistan.
Candir Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His older brother, Kandir Baroch, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of murdering his sister on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment with the most attention of his father-in-law, Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by Balochi, who is famous for being provocative in Pakistan, which is very strong in women's contempt, although it is not as big as Western standards.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
He said in a press conference a few days later that he had killed his sister, "Of course" and that his sister's actions were "unable to forgive" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, convicted and sentenced him to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar (the thought of God) will be innocent in the Supreme Court," the lawyer said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Baroch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of neglecting the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "honorary murders."
Women choose their own marriage partner - in the case of Barochi, they have been burned, shot, stabbed or strangled by crimes such as praise of their sexuality and shameful family members.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisas (murder reward) and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow perpetrators to be pardoned from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, his parents changed their mind and asked him to forgive him.
In response to international hatred of murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented means of declaring the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a bright red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although criticized and threatened, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the creation of a new heaven and earth in a country considered to be a political activity that boldly improves the status of women to express themselves as a presence like Kim Kardashian.
The roots of the "priority" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely throughout South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

Both organizations mediate, dispatch and share information about their trainers and instructors when training related to sports.
When a team of remote islands embark on an expedition outside the island, they will work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Prefectural Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association with the ASA, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Prefecture Sports Promotion Center, in the event of a prefectural tournament and other tournaments on the mainland, we will support the athletes to prevent their performance from falling due to fatigue during their journeys and consecutive nights.

Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo!News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice as much about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Mr. Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko adheres to the traditional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool man.
if you're bound by what you should do
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, we talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and people's behavior.
When we learn patterns, the brain systemizes behavior by doing this better, so I think we will be able to live happily.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether I'm "mote" or not.
That's why it's easy to live.
I was taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit tough if you're sticking to the old pattern of "a university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will survive.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
In my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is, I've talked about that much.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by admitting that person.
It's not that easy.
It's hard to ask around yourself.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record do not need to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by the "thinkness," you cannot be light.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of position or age, "cute" for any man seems to be an excuse and salvation.
It is difficult to say what this "cute" is.

To the northwest of Nigeria in illegal state, the number of refugees doubled to 40,000: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 due to intensified violence over the past four months.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, it is necessary to cooperate with each institution to raise funds for $35.5 million.
UNHCR spokesman Babar Barok said that the Islamic extremist organization Bokoharam, which has been working on anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Nigeria over the past ten months in Sokot, Zamfara and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"The fear of illegal and unstable conditions is well represented," Barrok said on Friday to the press.

The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising for header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their requests.
The Service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system where a fair bid competition for multiple bidders (advertisers) allows media companies to deliver high-priced ads preferentially.
It has been introduced mainly by major media as a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability.
In the past, we have provided SSP with advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to a particular ad frame that has a high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase advertising frames that meet the needs of advertisers.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP is expanded.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP header binding allows them to participate in bidding directly for header binding target ad frames, which is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, because the target media company is limited, the advertising frame of the delivery destination according to individual commercial materials and brand image is secured, preventing damage to brand value.
One of the advantages of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of the bidder companies called "Lapper Solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, will enable efforts to meet the expectations of the introduction of media companies.

Two months suspended Assistant Professor Yamagata in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On August 27, Yamagata University announced that an assistant professor in his 30s at Yonezawa Campus (Yonezawa City) was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Assistant Professors of the University of Tokyo, from around October 2017 when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, were emotional and abused in inappropriate words.

Cabinet Revolts Responding to Boris Johnson to reduce demands for withdrawal from the EU and to compromise with the EU The Sun
Now that only three weeks have passed since the EU summit meeting, there is a growing concern around the Prime Minister that the prime minister might be out of time to withdraw significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in demands for EU withdrawal and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations over a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are tight, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative to "impossible."
The senior ministers expect the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel to propose a compromise proposal on the ground floor, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They will demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings, and insist that the EU accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One Cabinet member said that the Supreme Court's ruling that the closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday would be "a warning," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House of Representatives, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available from his steps.
It is not effective even if it is radical, and the Cummings plan clearly fails.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another minister promised to speak to Johnson to carry out an agreement with former Prime Minister Terryza May if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many things that everyone is trying to end.
If we postpone it, Boris will end and we will all end.
Lord John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering the negotiations.
In a harsh speech, the former leader of the Conservative Party said, "The Prime Minister said to us that he wants to make an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Whales, and discussing with the people on the streets.
The prime minister's press yesterday admitted that the agreement was still a long way ahead, saying, "No one should think about it - if it is to achieve the goal, the road is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which would force a three-month postponement in case of an unconfirmed withdrawal, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill has hindered our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue moving forward despite the bill's passage."
Stephen Berkeley, Minister of Departure of the European Union, returned to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, told the television station boss that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was so nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone on the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I will never forget that morning Ann Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my favorite place is here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Davelake, and then began a program named Lorraine.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, she broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
" passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity" were the key to survival in the television industry, and the moderator said, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and honest.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't even think that many families of children who were killed or injured watched us broadcast the show live from Dunbrane.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, personally told me to meet me, so we decided to speak at her house for hours.
Not taking it all on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and "very respecting the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the pain and pain of the net that they do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fear of traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Konstantino Chiwenga declined the offer of the presidency from former President Robert Mugabe, who was in the midst of the political turmoil, due to fears that it might be a trap to deny military action in November 2017.
The Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the defense forces during the coup.
However, the reason why Chiwenga refused the offer was not because of anxiety, but because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of his government in a coup.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirms that officials are senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munngawa," it is said that intense negotiations were held at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, aware that he was losing power, made contact with the envoy to Chiwenga.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was carried out by three persons.
President Spokesman George Charamba, senior officials said that he was involved in negotiations by Aaron Nepera, then head of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Fidelis Muconoli, Roman Catholic bishop.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to condemn the African Union's military actions while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the presidency to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was a wasteful act to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there was a little political aim of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If something destroys the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I hope the commanders remembered that they had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not be defeated.
The late President, Mugabe, hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would crush the claims of the commanders who claimed that he was trapped and did not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, would decide whether it would be a coup, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
Officials say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that they would not turn guns to the citizens, even if they had invaded the presidential house called the Blue Roof.
At that point, Mugabe said he wanted two things: to protect his family and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
A powerful metaphorical expression was used in the words of the envoy (Gono), who told the president's desperate message: "Is Tiri Bemaqwapa Macwapa (we belong to the camouflage group, the military department), and we are not politicians or political competitors."
The government officials said that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the aim was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to bring back Munangagwa, who had been short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed assistance from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at the time, the South Africans who were key to this process refused to intervene, but were repeatedly threatened behind it, clarifying that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military entered the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources tell the Independent.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to ban nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th, a meeting was held at the UN Headquarters in New York to aim for a world free of nuclear weapons.
Five new states ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, including 32 countries and regions.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total elimination of nuclear weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern over recent years that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There's nothing to do with it."
China needs strong leadership.
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In a white paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party's administration 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic conditions are complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will face division and collapse, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified dealing with problems in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemoration ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he took power in late 2012.
Xi has also directed the modernization program of the military that threatens the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export the development model of its own country, nor does it intend to adopt a model of other countries, but rather merely seek peace.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the powerful, and war and chaos left a deep scar with that pain; China would never take the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "renunciate" its core interests, nor allow it to undermine security and sovereignty.
"The threat of trade war and the rising tariffs do not lead to any problem-solving," White Paper states.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am confident that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities, and opening a new world.
China has no idea of countering the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., so the U.S. should consider China's development calmly.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
The U.S. would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Takayoshi dismissed director Hirata and director Kaneko, and a rumor was found (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as the coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.
As for director Hirata and director Kaneko, the local newspaper reported on the 26th that there was a rumor about baseball club members.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the interviews with 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they generally accepted the facts and dismissed them on 28 August.
In the summer of 15th, Motochika WATANABE (74), who was raised by Daisuke MATSUSAKA and others, left Yokohama.
It was under the control of director Hirata and director Kaneko.
In the summer of 16 years, he participated in the Koshien Garden for three consecutive years, and this spring he also participated in the Senbatsu.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in the fall, and the Senbatsu tournament in the next spring was desperate.
Spice Girls' Mel C, eating disorders, and eating disorders banned dieting at home.
Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom admitted that home-based diets were banned from eating any food other than fruits and vegetables for many years.
Sporty spices have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders after years of "excessive exercise" without eating well under pressure from members of the global pop group.
Chisholm said that his experience influenced his daughter Scarlett's child-rearing, and stated that "all topics related to diet in the family are prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his own appearance."
However, because I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, still in front of SNS, a "bad" comment on himself written in the media led to physical problems, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out a particular food group, became more and more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Judiciary judgment of same-sex marriage: The opportunity to expand diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch judged that this was a case in which 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage was a matter of dispute between the same sex.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, and there is a system in which local governments, such as Sapporo City, recognize same-sex partnerships, which are not legally effective in Japan.
The court ruled that the two women were actually married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to allow same-sex couples to have legal protection.
In the case that the same-sex marriage is not allowed due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Registration Law, a lawsuit seeking damages to the country as unconstitutional is filed in five district courts such as Sapporo.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities, and discuss how the legal system should recognize various families.
Women lived together for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the United States, but the plaintiffs sought compensation for their former partners after they were found guilty.
The court ruled that "the reality of factual marriage between men and women is not the same" due to the fact that the two lived together.
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of actual marriages with the same-sex marriage rights, such as social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that defines marriage as "only based on the mutual agreement."
Both sexes were "unprecedented at the time of establishment because same-sex marriage was not expected, and the purpose of denying same-sex marriage is not understood."
While the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various places, because the government does not state whether or not it is forbidden.
On the other hand, since the same-sex marriage was not recognized, the problem remained that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection differ from the genders."
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while admitting the same reality as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, about 70 percent of people believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a legal spouse, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in the tax system and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriage between same-sex couples but also expanding legal rights for actual marriage.
to the trial and jury trial of former athletes prosecuted for rape of multiple women.
A jury trial was held for former Delaware University baseball players who were accused of sexual assault by multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and arguments, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
A 21-year-old woman stated that she was sexually assaulted after sending Conaway to her home by car.
The two met after three weeks at the meeting site Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women were inconsistent and misconception, and that women regretted having physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure and said, "It's time for the next season to take the pennant." - Yahoo! News
In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final game of this season, and the possibility of his own entry into CS was eliminated.
In the fourth place, if Hanshin wins the remaining three games, the ranking will be changed.
At the ceremony after the match, Koichi Ogata (50) apologized, saying, "I'm sorry that I couldn't win the final game, and I couldn't confirm the ranking.
Some fans were invited to participate.
At the end of his speech, he said, "I will do my best to rob Penant next season."
However, when asked by the press about the matter after the ceremony, he said, "It's not finished yet, it's all."
[Dospo] Ota is the 4th and 20th most self-executive after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
It became a reward for the seniors.
He took the lead four times and ran his 20th home run with a liner on the left.
I arrived at the number of home runs that I was aiming at, and said, "I stopped receiving this number and tried to do it again, and I became a big one."
The director's intention was also firm.
This was the first time a four-year contract was signed.
He said, "I put it in fourth place so that I could swing by thinking."
Oda responded to his expectations: "I felt that way, and as a result I entered the game, I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal four statues is Abe, a giant who retired from active duty this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads to victory, and the 4th is the team's 4th, and the 4th seniors who have seen the giants were the same."
Among them, "Mr. Abe came to mind the most, he was a reliable person, and he looked at his back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist destinations, obviously in video
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $2109 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, Circler Keys, Luna Park and some of the famous Harbour Bridges.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow through the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with suckers, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing into Sydney Harbour by rainwater.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting waterways.
In a video released on September 27, coincidentally on the day of world tourism, Dr. Katherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
Although it looks beautiful, it is one of the most polluted estuary of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour is expected to flow into the waterway, most of which are flowing into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but the Sydney Harbour after that... was quite tragic," Dr. Daffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what's going on there," said Richard Nichols, owner, Dave Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste each year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what's under the water), I think everyone will be really excited.
Over half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The other half is plastic at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing right under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of Ocean Protect's founders and director, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce the amount of plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the amount of plastic used, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30% of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
This video, funded by the recycling company TOMRA, was released and coincided with the release of the video this month, a new study on plastics and mental health was also announced.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between 12 and 18 years old have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also stated that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed were increasingly worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Station was demolished in October | The Government and Society of Saga News | Saga News
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which began demolition work in October, is Futako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin dismantling the chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The two cars were used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
One chimney is broken down by a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine buildings and boilers were not destroyed.
The man in his 60s, who runs a restaurant nearby, said, "When I look back from the distance and see the chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first was abolished in 89 and the second was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because it is near Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine electric cars, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

I am now (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Mayo Takahashi, a free announcer and monthly commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," spoke about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save my rotten self.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is more like a teacher than a father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
My father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important to me as a member of society.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was told that I was a conne or a busaik, my father said, "I thought it was a conne, but it wasn't so.
Then, around the second or third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty girl Anna is good," and even when I was not motivated because I wanted to do the job I wanted to do, "Who can do the job is hard to do."If so, "I asked everyone to do it, but I was glad to be in charge of Mama.Next, let's appoint Mama"I changed my mind and worked harder than ever before.
i learned naturally from my father's performance.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but actually since I joined the TV station, I've always been exposed to the news through the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when I read the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe was happy and confident that he was "good at reading Mama news."

Workshops in Kagamihara
Workshop on the role and effect of five musical instruments played by kumidori (a group dance) = 26th, Kagamihara Junior High School
A group dance workshop (hosted by the Prefectural Board of Education Education Agency) was held at Kagamihara Junior High School on the 26th.
All students attended and learned about the 300-year history and birth of kumidori, as well as the acoustic effects and utilization of musical instruments played.
In the workshop, members of the OB Association of the Ryukyu Performing Arts Department of the Prefectural University of the Arts introduced the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing three lines, koto, taiko, kokyu and flute.
The host was from Miyakojima City, and Mr. Kawaman Kota of the OB Association, who introduced the charm of kumidori.
In this workshop, I learned how five kinds of musical instruments are represented in dance by taking up "music" from three components of kumidori (music, chant, Ryukyu dance).
As for the sanshin, it was explained that it was an element of the movement and emotion of the characters along with the song, and that the kokyu was pulling up the song and the melody of the sanshin while playing.
In the second half, the students experienced the sound of the instrument and felt the appeal of the instrument.
The purpose of this initiative is to get familiar with "Ryukyu classical music" through musical instruments, and to get interested in "gumi Odori" by many students.This is the first time in Miyako.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
It is the first of its kind to be held in New York City - Yahoo!
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18 cards.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which the International Automobile Federation (FIA) manages, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, the race has been held every year, becoming the world's highest rally championship with a history and tradition.It is said that it is the most severe auto racing championship because it runs not only on closed roads (paved roads), but also on gravel roads and snow roads at high speeds.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Invitation Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and Representative Director of Toyota Motor Corporation), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with relevant parties to ensure that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Japan as the center of motorsports representing Japan, and we will do our utmost to ensure the success of the Games in autumn 2020.
Governor Hajime Furuta of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all here."
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and Representative Director of Toyota Motor Corporation)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motor Sports, commented on the Japanese round.
The WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Shitara Town) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City, Ena City).
The main venue was announced to use "Love - Global Expo Memorial Park" (Nagakute City: commonly known as Morikoro Park) which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019, and on November 9 and 10, 2019, the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held as a test event.
is Tasmanian devil the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmanian devils may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers are opening a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient treatment.
Medical researchers have identified how some cancer cells camouflage.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will lead to new ways of treating cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCullum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there are cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change their treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing fatal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils, which are almost extinct.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camflage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
Peter McCullum researcher Mark Dawson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Traditional treatments may be reused to revitalize markers, or proteins known as MHCs, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it can be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face tumors in Tasmanian devils, where cancer cells escape detection as well.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process occurs in humans and Tasmanian devils," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may help control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-type planets orbit around small stars called red dwarfs, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas planet GJ3512b orbiting its main star, the red dwarf was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun's size, but the planet orbiting around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, led this research published in the journal Science.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Coloral Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, it is almost the same size as the giant planet and only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 degrees Celsius (6380 degrees Celsius/3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I'm doing red color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining the elliptic orbit of its Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which creates a star that orbits itself.
In the most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, the object is generated from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes the atmosphere by the attraction that the egg produces.
This rare planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might have been slightly larger than it was thought and the temperature was lower," Morales said.
In this state, the disk becomes unstable, so some dense regions may emerge.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a medip containing a stimulant, let his colleagues eat and prosecute him.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating a dip of beans with a wake-up agent to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was charged with suspected transfer of methane fetamine, a Class B felony and taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach deteriorated and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have contained methane phetamine in the bean dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández "was told the victim's food that he had put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane fetamine in a bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Derri shows Medina Hernández turning his camera back and leaning behind a microwave, but taking something out of the brazier.
After that, it is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put a bean dip in a small paper plate.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been given contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was detained in Marion County Prison instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gunn, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of felony by assault, robbery, supplication, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Public Administration and Society|Saga Newspaper News|Saga Newspapers
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required reorganization and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced the hospital's name on September 26.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in Japan, and three have already been integrated and transferred.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Taramachi Tatara Hospital, Fujitsu County.

Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi emphasized that "As a town, we have an idea to operate alone and cooperate with hospitals in neighboring cities, and hospitals must remain absolutely for residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The director of the administrative department at Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "I have not heard the contents from the prefecture."
The Regional Medical Function Promotion Agency (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not a mechanical decision to determine the direction of public hospitals, but a request was made to reconsider at the Regional Medical Concept Coordination Conference in each prefecture."
"We would like to hear from the parties about the future hospital operation.
In some cases, we may ask you to review medical subjects and to further reduce the floor of the sick."

Secrets of the Royal Family: the surprise and frequent use of royal aircraft
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use a private machine that moves the royal family around the world for important events and appearances.

There is no limit to the number of baggage, and the Royal Family seems to be able to invite guests, including unexpected passengers, as much as they like.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, only Queen and Prince Philip are frequently used by royal aircraft.
During the "Royal Flight Secrets" program, the Queen's former flight attendants revealed that many of her hairy guests with her family often ride.
Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, like a very important royal customer, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggy Dog Privileges are famous, and it is not surprising to request that a cute pet be brought together to travel.

In 2007, he had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linette, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, there were five Cockerspaniel bists, oxo, flash, pick, and spans, as well as four mix dogs cider, berry vulcan, and candy.
The staff of the Royal Navy will be busy.
The royal staff had been seen asking the dogs to leave the lawn before boarding, and Seals continued.
I've never been in an accident.

sometimes you feel that pressure from yourself and people around you is too big.
That's why it's my biggest advice that I don't rush to do anything over time.

Trump Hotel owner complains about the suitability, but also holds a license to sell liquor.
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Commission dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel, as the owner's suitability was questioned.
On Wednesday, three members, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on the state law that requires the applicant's "appropriateness" to obtain a liquor license.
In the first appeal filed in the summer of last year, he accused President Trump of assault and repeated fraud, claiming that he violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This is the second time a petition has been issued to update the permit.
The honey collected by Bentley's "Flying Bees" is the first harvest!
How is the taste of honey collected by Flying Bees raised on the knees of Flying B?
In May 2019, a set-up bee was launched on the grounds of the UK Bentley Crew Factory and the first honey was harvested in September of the same year.
More than 100 bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make beekeeping on the site of a factory that assembles cars?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honey beets produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers watched over the fact that bees are gathering honey from wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is amazing that there is so much harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been engaged in a wide range of activities through its Crew Factory and our business to become the top sustainable luxury car manufacturer, and is part of this effort.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the harvest amount of bentra honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to carry out various initiatives to fulfill our role." In May 2019, 1.2 million honeybees, Flying Bees, were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator, filtered the fallen honey, and then bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The label design was handled by Louise McCullum, designer for Bentley interiors.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we want to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey such as scones.
it's the worst in the u.k. in a series of scandalous reports.
A police officer named him the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
According to the Cleveland Police Department, "a serious deterioration" continues.
The police have replaced five police chiefs in six years and are now facing a new demand for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley, Director of the Police Department, said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Police chief Mike Wiel resigned in January less than a year after his inauguration, but he was "very serious" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
Deputy Director Adrian Roberts was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal activity.
Lieutenant Simon Herwood, last year, came to the Commission for Investigation of illegal acts because of his colleague's involvement in sexual acts.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official confirmation that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Home Affairs intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I have full responsibility for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal," impeachment must be settled.
Nobody knows what will happen.
At present, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate."
"I'm going to do a job that I'm starting to do based on the time it takes to discover facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Wallodymil Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Giulani.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security attorney in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before formal inquiries.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of political fund violations.
In response to Barr's question of whether to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee would decide who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, referring to Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the telephone talks with the Ukrainian president in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision regarding the disposition of this accusation.
Perosi said he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower who became the source of information when Trump attacked the accuser as a spy on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about those who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Perosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about the alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political gain and wrote a historic step.
The call content is included in the accusations published on Thursday, in which whistleblowers claim that Trump abused his authority to "quest for intervention" in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from ministerial computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace Forward Christian Bentek, speed violation prohibited driving
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, is said to have been banned from driving.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old forward admitted on January 20, that he had driven his Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 speed limit in Richmond, southwest London.
The Belgians then shot a speed violation camera in March at Patney, southwest London, driving 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentecke pleaded guilty of these two violations under a single answer procedure in which one justice of the peace tried and sentenced him to light crime.

Ghana: Concerns about Cofi Manu and the composition of the Review Committee
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Cécondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) election.
He questioned the inclusion of Frank Davis, who expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu stated that the chairperson was interested in the results of the review process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside the previous interests, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The members of the committee were scheduled to end on October 4 after taking office at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer, Chairman of the Board.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Appocavi, sports director and lawyer.
According to a study by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2 percent of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage to be 1,000 yen per hour.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded that they "approved" to raise the hourly wage to 1,000 yen, including information related (100 percent), construction (70, 6 percent), and wholesale (61, 7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service industries (60 and 9 percent), including food, drink, and lodging (60 and 9 percent), and transportation was synonymous.
The representative of the meeting said, "There is a high tendency for companies to oppose in part-time and time-consuming industries, but many companies think that it is difficult to secure human resources and increase labor costs."
On the other hand, the average salary of companies who responded that they could raise was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, a total of 61.3% of regular employees were hired, 54.5% were hired, and 15.4% were employed non-regularly.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (37.5%, 37.5%) and the construction industry (24.1%, 38.1%) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% had challenges in hiring, and in many cases, the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government for the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (department within three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There was also a view to encouraging students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% said that they already recognized the sub-sector and/or business proposed by the government in the growth strategy.
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total showed acceptance.
There were 64.4% of companies that were "not admitted" and high construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%), and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tipric, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiplic said, "It's time to show you now," when Wales will host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Wallabeads, they will be the hottest winner in Pool D, and will likely be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, which has played 15 games so far, wins 14 against Wales, Tipric and his team will be a straight line for the best 8 against England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to challenge and win at the top of the group and end," said Tipric of Wales.
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last fall.
I think Australia is quite blaming me to return my debt, but I will do my best to win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And now I'm here, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Wales has won the third place since 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gutland, all three Southern Hemisphere heavyweight teams won only seven out of 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tipric was included in several representative members who won 9-6 of the match, one of the players who played at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Before the victory, Tipric said, "It's hard to answer.
Surely the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it was impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, he scored about 15 points in the final game, so he seemed to be much closer than he actually did."
The key to Welsh victory is the break-down battle between Australian duo Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Law.
Up until now, Tipric has played 67 international matches, and has played several games and both players in the past, and knows exactly what they are waiting for.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When I play against the background of the World Glass, I always know that I will be facing a tough game from now on.
They are always the best in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is an aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when needed.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself rather than confronting the very strong background.
I want to fight with the best opponent, and if I fight against the two, I have to keep up with myself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to accumulate good performance, you can play a game that won't lose on the momentum after that.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from an entertainer?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said at a press conference on July 22 that "the company is 9 and there is no talent 1 or so at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha reacted.
As for the ratio of "9:1" to "9:1," if Yoshimoto had 90 percent, it would be considered that there was a gift from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and investors who were paying taxes were also on Twitter.
If Gyara's share was "9:1," would there be a gift tax?
i heard from you.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer your question from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If it is "9:1," Yoshimoto's sales will be 1 million yen and expenses will be 100,000 yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns like this and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you think about allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying or selling real estate) not far from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a problem in calculating taxes.
However, as in this case, a third party will not be able to determine the amount of tax-appropriate price for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think the payment statement for 1 yen is a pity.

the white house, the impeachment apprehensive, panic.
On Thursday, the White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party, and detailed officials explained that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seemed to be increasing "a concern, anxiety, and concern" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers would damage the President and some surrounding persons.
He said, "I don't really think it's true."
The White House official joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, or that the usual measures that the President has made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied, so there was no confidence in how to proceed because this claim was so serious.
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" because the impeachment question was prolonged, the President's response to the impeachment would increase the likelihood of being "incompetent."
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is seen to be raised every day, and some close associates of the president are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has taken increasingly unpredictable actions and spurred concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has become concerned about the President and politics in the election year environment.
Trump faced the greatest threat he had ever faced during his term of office, reviving the strategy he judged effective during the Russian investigation by Robert Moller, and changing his position as an attacker or defense.
Trump tried to neglect the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of whistleblowers as they were motivated by partisan conflict.
However, many White House officials have endured the Morale trials, but this time they are beginning to feel the difference.
The president, whose power is considered a brand, seemed to be attending the press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a mind to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that damage can be mitigated, claiming that it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of whistleblowers, as some have grasped the fact that they did not have direct information about the calls with President Trump, Vladimir Zellensky, and Ukrainian Presidents, which are controversial.
Furthermore, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic family close to the White House points out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and the impeachment will not have much effect on gaining new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with legislative proposals and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President for the next four months."
Another sources said that those claiming impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how uncertain the response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to an official who explained this plan, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as strategic decision rooms will be implemented or what kind of actions will be implemented.
However, this person said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum that the publication and publication of critical internal accusations had given the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin have stated that the lack of long-term strategic viewpoints is clearly visible, such as saying that they would not be able to document 48 hours after Trump announced that he would not publish a note on the call with the Ukrainian president.
According to a person involved in this case, the person who could be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump, and Corrie Luwandowski, former head of the Counter-Terrorism Headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never met with the president or close advisers about joining a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Morale investigation, left the White House legal adviser Pat Cipolon with less experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
Details of the White House's strategy are generally aware that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but that they need people who are organized and can lead the overall response and political struggle.

What is the narration of Utchan?
"Sport News" - Yahoo!
NHK's serial TV novel "Natsuzora" starring actress Suzu Hirose (21) (Monday to Saturday, 8 o'clock in the previous day) ended on August 28.
[Photo] Suzu Hirose, I was able to eat goats at the location of "Natsuzora" ~ !?
This is the 100th anniversary of Dora.
The heroine Okuhara no Natsu (Hirose), who became an orphan in the Pacific War and was taken over by the Shibata family, a dairy farmer in Hokkaido, grew up and appeared to fly into the anime world in Tokyo.
In 1996, Nanako Matsushima of "Himawari," Ayako Kobayashi of "Oshin" in 1983, Tomoko Yamaguchi of "Tsune-chan's cheering song" in 1988 and the heroine of the past Asadra are also talking about gathering.
In the final week, he said, "I'm going to win 10 games."
In the spring of 1975, when the entrance ceremony for Yu (Mashida Mitsuzakura) was held, the work of Nanatsu and others was well received.
Although "Sola, a girl in the prairie" became a popular show, the production of the broadcast girigiri continued, and Asako (Tsunechidani Shihori) worried about the promotion from television stations.
One day, there is a problem that the video that has been carried in the rain gets wet, but the ambitions of Sakaba (Nakagawa Daisuke) are not diminished.
The show ended safely and went to Hokkaido with Chiharu (Kiyohara Aya).
The Shibata family was attacked by a blackout, and the latest farm facilities that were electrified were stopped.
This morning, Dora was voiced by Mitsuyoshi Uchimura of "Utchan Nanchang" as his father who died.
At the end of each Saturday, the narration "I'll Continue next week" was standard, but the final episode was "Natsuyo, Morning Dora."
"I'm going to do it for the 101st time," he concluded, and gave Baton to "Scarlet" starring Erika Toda starting next week.
On the internet, "I thought I would continue to do the 101st work of Morning Dora."

The success rate is only 16% Tomoyoshi Morikawa - Yahoo! News

I was able to have a boyfriend because of his work, but for a long distance love ...
I was told to marry someday, but I couldn't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation with our allies to marriage?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice and required reading is derived from detailed data analysis.
what's this?
I am worried about whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during a long distance romance.
I want to continue living in Kansai, where I have work and my family.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, administrative office)
The couple who got married from long distance love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (hereinafter, -) C is in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend for one and a half years.
There is also a word that "the distance is tested and the two become stronger," but in the first place, is long distance love going well?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) A survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous, but according to the data, only 16% of couples who came from distance love to marriage are known.
Since love is done with five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touch), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep in touch with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you're going to your opponent's house, you'll be burdened with time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if you're on a holiday to heal the tiredness of your work, your body is a kata.
I feel happy when I go home.
Isn't that the only way to break apart when it comes to distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure without having to meet frequently or a couple who have a certain period of time in advance.
You'll be engaged a year later, or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult to find a future landing point.

Debbie Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
Thursday, in a comment defending the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain presidential nude photos.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive at the House of Representatives Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had requested to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicions were a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special commission negotiated with Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos," he said.
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes ended, HuffPost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democrats were trying to find the truth.
He was the only member of the House of Representatives from the Democratic Party of Connecticut, Jim Heims, but many other members questioned whether the answer to the House of Representatives was a naked truth.
Memediate.com speculates that Nunes' nudist comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that are said to have been written in steel documents that are controversial.
It is a notorious report that former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected by Trump watching prostitutes urinate in a hotel in Moscow.

The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing can be used at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and Representative Director of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services that will solve the challenges of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have the Origami ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get timely information.
He also explained that by expanding the app not only on the Origami app but also on partner companies' apps, it would be possible to use the service even if you don't have the Origami app.
In terms of financing, we introduced the ability to post-payment in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were needed suddenly, it was completed on the Origami app from application to repayment.
In terms of insurance, we introduce Aioi Nissei Insurance and First Life as a partner company.

New business for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that it will launch a new business that will support the effective use of data, including data held by companies, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its own Pay through the payment function provided by Origami.
In partner companies that partner with Origami, such as payment and settlement functions, it is recognized that effective utilization of data such as acquisition of structured data such as sales and unstructured data in the real world, accumulation, processing and analysis of such data will become a challenge.
Among them, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with payment data by its Pay and structured data held by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the promotion of effective data utilization and the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.
Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies gather various data to create customer contacts," and explained, "In the next phase, how to use data to develop business models is key."

In addition, he said, "If we can do activities that can expand the meeting even a little," he said.
After the dedication, the Messe-ji, which was sent by Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the Korean Association for Arts and Exchange in Korea and the International Institute of Chuchu Thought, was introduced.
potential reduction of exhaust gas in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only airplane to fly in the sky and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuels.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fats to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude oil-based fuels, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology achieved (actually generated) is hydrocarbons of molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma that doesn't matter," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as biofuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try it in a reactor to change the chemical reaction a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Currently, Foge operates a testing plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build 25 million US dollars of production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher in fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decisions made after the explanation.

Boris Johnson's camp warns that Britain will face riots like Los Angeles if Brexit is overrun.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of a violent uprising by the people in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson stated that "it is necessary to quell anger" against political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but insisted that the term "defeat" would not be used.
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain calm, one minister told The Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Yellow Best Movement or Los Angeles riots in 1992.
People do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to a verdict of innocence.
This year, the French anti-government demonstrators Gire Joan, wearing the eye-catching yellow vest, have caused confusion and destruction in the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of a "strong riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to hold a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a House of Representatives rebellion demanding a withdrawal from the EU and instead calling for a compromise to strike the EU.
TeNY TV Niigata - Yahoo! News

The opening match of Niigata will be played on Saturday, October 5 at Away against Albuquer Tokyo.
Pakistani social media celebrity brother, a life sentence for honor killing.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the case fades.
"It's too time-consuming, so people forget," said Farzana Bali, the first female rights activist at the University of Pakistan's gender department, adding that even the case of Balochi, which is attracting attention, took more than three years to solve.
Human rights groups say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honorary murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much higher than that, because it is estimated that about one-fifth of the 5,000 honor killings in Pakistan are occupied by honor-based violence monitoring organizations worldwide every year.
11.3 billion yen countermeasures against pork cholera To add to the September compensation plan in Shizuoka Prefecture (Asatsune Shimbun) - Yahoo! News

flood and chaos caused by prolonged monsoons in india
The monsoon season in India is about a month long, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37% higher than usual.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues for a few days, the monsoon will weaken during the latest decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, the buildings collapsed due to heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays, killing several people.
The houses are flooded, and the inhabitants walk through the streets with water on their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon season.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Raknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains have caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
The prolonged monsoon is undesirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon at this time.
Prakash Meherer, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables are rotting by rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is on October 8 in Dašera, where Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, the evil smiling figure of a beard-boom appearing in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since dolls are made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, it may be Lavana to laugh at the end.
【Sendai】Compact defense and defeat difficult enemy Yokohama M Director Watanabe, non-public practice and response (sports knowledge) - Yahoo! News
J1 Begalta Sendai held a private practice for four days from 24 to 4 consecutive days (only 20 minutes at the beginning) for the 28th Battle of Home Yokohama M (at 7 pm, Utah).
Although Yokohama M lost 15 points in the last three games of the league, Shin Watanabe (45) responded by saying, "The players showed me a powerful, battle-like exercise."
Last season, he suffered a loss of 8 points in a clubworth game at home (July 18).
It is a difficult enemy to lose in 1-2 this season.
Yokohama M, the third largest city in Sendai, currently ranked 14th, has 48 points in the league.
In addition to the 13-point FW Marcos Juniol (26), 10-point 7-assisted FW Nakakawa Teruto (27) and other strong front players, J's leading CB duo from Japan's DF Hatakenaka Makinosuke (24) and Toshito's Brazilian DF Chiago Multins (24).
Watanabe said, "There are plenty of aggressive play in and out, there are also speed CBs, we want to protect compactness and fight confidently without seeing any tear."
The Emperor's Cup for the first time was defeated by J2 Nagasaki on the 18th, with only eight league matches remaining.
The commander said, "It was a regrettable loss, and it is the most important thing to stand up from there."
It enhances the feeling and shows the results of countermeasures with pitch.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
Current studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to male groups who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this study is the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women or other races because it only targets Japanese Americans.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear years after exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year follow-up survey, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably due to the increased importance of other factors related to aging, and the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides was not important to heart disease and heart attack.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone meeting
The impeachment procedure for U.S. President Donald Trump was taken, and the Washington political issue was a radical week.
For political novice Vladimir Zellensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump phone problem so far, and will the Zellensky influence a wide range?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's 1000% argument is controversial.
Zerensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for support from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the EU's assistance including sanctions and economic assistance during the Russian invasion.
Politicians from Ukraine, Victoria Voytica, said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then hinted at military aid and asked Zellensky to investigate two rather than one, the first against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is an investigation on the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic Party's email fraud during the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone.
Thanks to the announcement of the call record, I am grateful to those who support it."
Zellensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana for provisionally winning 89.89% of its effective implementation rate and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Organization's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award is a result of the recognition that Ghana complies with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO on safety at airports and national airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's delayed national zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for security evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was awarded to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aikoi Otou to Canada, and Director of Ghana Airport Company of Yau Kuwakwa.
In his speech, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Bennard Aliou stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to continue to be aware that aviation safety, security, and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
He also said that this award complements the sector's indomitable efforts and perseverance, and is a gift of Ghanaian efforts.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a tremendous potential to develop the domestic economy as "air is likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but they are all safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump appoints Peter Gino as FEMA Chief: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Senate Committee held at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
FEMA's deputy director, Gino, was in the position of deputy director to oversee government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been vacant since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, stated that Mr. Long had illegally used government vehicles to commute between Washington and his home, Norcarorina.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, raised doubts about drunkenness and involvement in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of this month after consideration.
His appointment as director was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he was on duty at the Emergency Management Department in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying activity in San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pen-type beeps, a large container of Butanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found in an office building located at 9600 blocks on Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that investigators also found equipment packed with beep cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
Lieutenant Cano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigations, and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used for the beep products.
"Only static electricity from clothes can ignite, and because it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," says Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions and fires one after another.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately disclosed.
The investigator said that he received some anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still in pursuit of who is the black curtain of illegal baby activities.
Police said that because the office was empty, Zhang himself believed that the office had a store.
As the investigation continued, police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to prevent illegal bating products from appearing again.
"I don't know if it's real or what I'm buying."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a significant impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
During the concert, there was a huge earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6!
Evacuation training at Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
A practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held every year.
On stage, a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department is performed, and it is assumed that an earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6 is occurring along the way of the song.
About 300 people including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff participated in the training on the 27th.

The lost dress of Elizabeth I, exhibited at Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver foil yarn, and the gorgeous embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
The dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, Elerie Lin, has decided to be one.
Lin saw this fading piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in one rural area, which was placed there 100 years ago, and is considered part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally found this gorgeous cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly the room where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one other dress left in the 16th century shows that it was an important discovery throughout the royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passage of sleeves into the dress, three years of research have raised the conviction of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
One of the most expensive textiles of the royal family was the silver thread cloth, which was prepared by law only by senior members of the royal family.
It is believed that the dress was equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions when it was built.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen would be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace or would not have endured by rivalries wearing such gorgeous clothes.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
Everyone was always happy to see the cloth and say, "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one piece of dress used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton, cut and blind, seems unexpected but not so.
Bactton is a village from Blanch Parry, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and a local legend says that the cloth was long associated with Parry.
Although the dress dates back to 1590, experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley before Elizabeth died in 1603.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on very delicate hand sewing, will be displayed next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing similar dresses, one of the most admired contemporary paintings lent by Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and led the work, Libby Thompson said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you'll feel really respectable to the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the front and back, you will feel a great respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched for" A week after missing girls, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew Volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk such as mountain slopes and saws, but they could not find clues.
Also, on the 27th, the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search were lost, and the search was not found.
The police and fire departments are planning to continue their search from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral dialectic, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech in the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation because the value of one vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member was the lowest in the country in the election held in July this year.
In the first oral argument held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
In response, the Defendant's prefectural election management committee called for a rejection of the claim as "it should be constitutional, not that it was in a significant inequalities that could cause the issue of constitutionality."
The judgment will be passed on October 30.

Arriving at the space station, an unmanned supply machine caught with a robotic arm | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
Konotori No. 8, an unmanned supply vehicle that arrived at the International Space Station.
The station's robotic arm extends from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th.
On the night of the 28th, the unmanned spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA), carrying supplies to the International Space Station at an altitude of about 400 kilometers, arrived near the station.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the difference in speed and approaches to a distance of about 10 meters.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters long is the flow that grabs the supply machine.
There are about 5 tons of supplies.
After being installed on the station, the flight attendants carry out the cargo.
he was involved in one third of the drug in the united states
Shortly after Chicago Westside's sunrise, CBS News caught rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of overdose.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of Chicago's drug was brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named Nemecio Cervantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Matthew Donahew DEA executive officer in Mexico said, "Mencho is DEA and, in fact, the top priority of the U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were rampant.
El Mencho's drug cartels, Harrisco Nueva, are involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "massive" cocaine, methane fetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From the downfall of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho is not punished and is responsible for his own empire.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders involving drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occur a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing when handled.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the seller.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively take away the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the past
Sony revealed the PS4 limited version of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of its sequel, Last of As, February 2020.
Some of the video footage of this new action game was also presented to fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 news.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
Since the PS1 era, the Last of As Part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous one, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell stories with so many characters.
I didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but it eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all the other sections started."
The game was very large and did not enter a single Blu-ray, making it two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
There is no need to ruin this surprise, but Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic notydog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will know more.
Those who have PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like the Last of As Remastered and want to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including a replica of the popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet, a bonus version with a 12-inch figure.
Notoshima mobile sales "help" council attempts Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, mobile sales began by the Notoshima Regional Development Council, which was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings, and food crossed the Somachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
There were also products that were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents said that it was fun to choose products.
There were 110 wagons, including general vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even elderly people who live alone, a total of vegetables such as potato salad and kinpira gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
In the town of Suso, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Ms. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
Users also received orders such as "I want you to have coffee that drips on your own rather than canned coffee."
The council will consider what was requested.
There are currently only one convenience store in Noto Island where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to buy and sell goods to save "shopping weak."
Until December, the 20 town councils in the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to provide approximately $100 million additional assistance to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been reviewed significantly to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-stricken resident support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-stricken areas, up to 13 municipalities are provided with a maximum of US$100 million in drought relief money for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional assistance, the government has already recorded over $70 billion in budget for drought relief.
Ronald Lee Haskel: The murder of a former wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen, Katie Stay, and four of his five children.
The authorities said on July 9, 2014 that Haskell was forced into his residence and questioned the whereabouts of his wife Melanie Haskell.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskel fired, and Harris County Police Department announced that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old son, 9 and 7 years old daughter died.
Only one person in his family, Cashy Stay, who was 15 years old at the time, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but then recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's claim of innocence.
The jury was dismissed until Monday's trial.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of the girl who shook her anger resonated with the leaders of each country.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg delivered a speech asking for further measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and irritability protested all over the world, including Japan.
About 4 million people attended in more than 150 countries.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the rise in temperature before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to 1 or 5 degrees.
We will take measures taken by all participating countries without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather conditions, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, which are pointed out to be related to global warming, continue to occur in various regions.
In order to achieve global warming at a fast pace, one step is required to strengthen efforts.
At the summit held by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal to virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new targets, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become conspicuous.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy includes zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming at "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, Minister of the Environment, presented Japan's efforts at the environmental-related meeting, and at a meeting on climate change, said, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy things."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wound, which is not controversial, will be nothing more than the "replacement of issues" that the person himself counters.
There is no longer a grace to cope with global warming, and the international community must respond to the common crisis of humanity in a timely manner.
It can not be effective enough if there are deviations in each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
In order to avoid taking away that future, adults should act.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The research results of the United States Army led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and time-keeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Distributed Quantum Information Center of the Army Research Institute of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state and a measurement is performed on one side, even if one quantum bit is physically far away, the measurement results on the other are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who announced the results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bitpoints in entangled states despite the large distance.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step towards achieving large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and at the same time excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit the photon with a fiber optic cable.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Dr. Lañon.
In his team, he first sent light particles through non-linear crystals with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, the optimal value for long distance transfer - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
In the measurement results, atoms and light particles remained entangled even though they moved long distances after converting wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, leading to the realization of entangled networks in long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate position measurement, navigation, and time-keeping applications."
