Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina to protest the Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in the town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the barracks in Trugovska Gola and vow to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take away a healthy future" and "We need a hard stop" said nuclear waste disposal facilities could threaten the lives of about 250,000 people living in the Una and its surroundings.
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grad, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities next week.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or to pay for the cost of Croatian waste processed in newly constructed facilities.
Tomislav Chorich, Minister of Environment and Energy of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a full solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would look for another construction site on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket be the best place in Croatia?"

PayPay salesman "I'm on the Wave" "I'm on the Wave" Cashless to happen "I'm on the Wave" I wonder if the waves will swell (Tokai TV) - Yahoo!
Tax increase starting in October.
In line with this, the country will start the cashless point reduction project.
To reduce the coldness of consumption, up to 5% is reduced.
[See in the picture] just before the tax hike...
So what's happening now is "introduction."
This is a cashless store that was previously a cash business.
We were close to the installation site.
[Cashlessing] immediately before the tax hike
"Okakiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular shop operated by Takeshin Seika, and there are more than 100 kinds of mushrooms and arashi in the shop.
Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users, visited Tatsushin on this day.
PayPay Yasuda: "Is there any payment method other than cash now?"
Mr. Shinmi, President of Takeyoshi Co., Ltd.: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it's easier than cash if I get used to it because it won't be possible to receive the Tsurisen.
To date, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce 20% of our usage by points.
Mr. Yasuda has been increasing the number of users explosively, but Mr. Yasuda is an "employee man" who sells the introduction of PayPay to the user's shop.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business so far.
The president also listened to Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's peak now, and if you're not able to talk about it before you jump in, or if you're going to do a consumer reduction business together, you're going to register as a member of PayPay and now you're riding a wave."
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the national consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves in the country's Consumer Reduction Business.
With the consumption tax increase from October, the government introduced a system to reduce the maximum amount of shopping to 5% to consumers to prevent the cooling of consumption.
As in "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before tax increases.

What is Münchhausen syndrome that appeared in Netflix's The Politicians?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are ill.
The Politician is broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, who wants to be president of the United States, but first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinnes Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, even though the person under their protection is not seriously ill.
There are many different types of diseases, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is falsely believed to be a disease of himself.
However, the surrogate Münchhausen syndrome implies that others who are clearly protected are ill.
It is also known as FII, forgery or induced disease, and is a type of child abuse.
Although it is unusual, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if a child is sick.
So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS lists the following items as caution.
The child is healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make the child feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Excessive medications and other drugs cause symptoms of disease.
How general is Muhnhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that 89 cases of 100,000 people had occurred in two years.
what should we do if we suspect child damage?
Ask local social welfare organizations or call NSPCC Children's Protection Helpline 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police force investigation into caduna schools, rescue 300 children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday at the Imam Ahmad Bun Humbal School in Rain Maidbun Tsunma, Igabi.
Police say that the children were inhumane, but the school denied this claim.
The school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
Parents came to deliver meals to their children every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were in.
I was very surprised to have closed the school after the police came and evacuated the children, and all the food the parents delivered left.
There are parents who can testify to the terrible environment the police say, "This is unfair treatment."
He adds that Abdullahman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

In the Central Coast, a girl raped in camouflage clothes, an order to confront the victim in court.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending a school in Central Coast, Kentucky.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to wood and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, a house search warrant was issued and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges of assault, grooming against another 11-year-old girl, and sexual abuse.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking along the path, and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and knife suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, don't do it," the man puts a head lock on the girl and forcefully takes her into the woods.
The man said to the girl, "Don't speak loud.
He said, "I'm going to have to deal with the pain."
The man had a knife on his right hand and tied the girl's hands with a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused it for nearly an hour.
When a man broke the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., with several phone calls and phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood on his clothes with mud, grass, and trees, and he was involved in street violence and chased the driver to the bush, claiming that he had fallen by hand.
The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development warns IT representatives of public benefits.
On Friday, Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors that the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice if not accompanied by ethical assessments of public interests.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
A few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited to the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age."
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and the responses of social media companies during the atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profit, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
The Pope warned, "If technological progress could cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it would not be the right true progress."
If the so-called technological advances of humans are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will go back to a certain kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they would like to use the expertise of the participants in this meeting to find people who can become future advisers of the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.
Nagano surprise directing G Abe's debut song to hit!
thank you, master.
Hisayoshinote (34) of Hiroshima and Nagano started his career at Mazda on the 27th.
The first two-and-a-half hit was "September" by Earth Wind & Fire in the appearance of giant Abe who announced his retirement this season.

Real Madrid loaned players Martin Udegor and backed up by a cheerleader.
Martin O'Degol gave a surprise assist to Michel O'Yalsabar.
Real Madrid defeated Ossana at 2-0, breaking the record in the domestic season and making it the top spot in La Liga.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, director Genedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, the pressure seemed to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves, was surprised by Michel O'Yalsabal's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, was a dribbling opponent's crotch and sent an exquisite pass through the inside of another two players to Oyal Sabal, where he scored the goal with this completely accurate thruball.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third goal of the stunning Oyalusabal penalty spot, he ensured the overwhelming victory of the Imanol team just before Arabes' midfielder Manu Garcia left in 5 minutes before the end.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but he struggled to demonstrate his reputation.
The young Norwegian, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally achieved this status.
Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When we contacted this lawsuit, Sharad Powerle's name was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's executive branch (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Ajit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Financial Cleanup Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit was reached, Sharad Powerl's name was nowhere.
An executive lawsuit and alleged that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name emerged and who referred it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct and claimed that it had nothing to do with the joint bank, and questioned the timing of filing a lawsuit just weeks before the October 21 elections in Maharashtra.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that it would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
NCP referred to the lawsuit by the Executive Bureau as a political abbreviation.

According to Colonel Tembeka Mubare, a spokesman for the Kuwazuru Natal police, a 20-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday.
The police said in this week that Drov was stabbed under the left side and abdomen.
Drov is said to have been a customer at the Musinga Drifkana Motorsport event on Saturday evening.
In a statement issued on that day, the organizers of the motor sports event stated in a preliminary report that the customer factor remained after the event's completion to watch the music performance.
Unfortunately, one of them was attacked by strangers on the way, and then died in a hospital.
In response to her death, UKZN suspended academic activities on Friday, stating that "We need to think about the frailty of life and the brutality that often happens in this society as a single community."

i agree to pay 30 million dollars for epipen settlement
The company agreed to pay $30 million for settlement in the event that investors did not disclose information about the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation on the presence or absence of over claims over epipenes on Medicade.
On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had classified epipen as "Generic" in the Medicadian drug rebate program.
This made it clear that payment from pharmaceutical companies to government was extremely low compared to when epipen was classified as a "brand" drug.
The company announced in July that it had reached a fundamental agreement with the SEC on this matter.
The statement issued on Friday does not affirm or deny the SEC's claims.
Stop the mistake of stepping on the accelerator pedal!
Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by miscarriage.
Among them, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistake by elderly drivers is increasing.
In particular, when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes panic, and sometimes the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
There are new cars equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such errors, but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended vehicles.
After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform pedal mistakes from a new perspective.
It is to avoid pedal mistakes with "an alarm sound."
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping, the acceleration is avoided.
It is difficult to understand changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who can hear easily.
The device is attached to the OBDII connector and the body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is affordable, and it is also attractive that you need to set up.
[Ashimo Watch and Watch] The World Wing launched its launch in mid-September with the Ashimo Watch and Watch.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is stepped suddenly, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator and instantly control the sudden start by turning it into a creeping state (the state of brake separation in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to be cleaned up.
The mounting is only possible with caperon and simple wiring.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

About 20 mothers who are raising children think about the form of disaster prevention suitable for each household, and summarize their awareness and requests for local governments.
Ms. Saori Kusumoto (32) of Kitamachi, Takeo City said that a three-year-old child who liked nursery school suddenly disappeared after a flood and was forced to go to the nursery school at night.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up the house and have not had enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can not panic and say "It's okay."
Yukari Ogushi (36) of Shiraishi Town spent a night at the evacuation shelter town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
"If you have a child who can't stay still, you will use your mind around you."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the event of a disaster with food and simple toilets.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinako Kawasaki (40), a 6-year-old and 8-year-old child in Shiraishi-cho, said, "I had an e-mail at elementary school last day, but there was no communication network or email system at nursery school.
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "It was okay last time."I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
TANAKA said, "I think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as an organization."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri, a female businessman, has been questioned by the police authorities.
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandal in office as a violation of the Penal Code.
The Greater London Administration (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts of conduct" on suspicion that Mr. Arcuri had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists in the presence of information indicating that a crime could have been committed," says GLA.
This was never proven.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to charges issued by the English and Welsh police.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the Chief of Police at that time.
Johnson denied misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, while claiming that he was "a misconception."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported in the press that U.S. citizens who had moved to London seven years ago had received preferential treatment from Johnson for £126,000 from public money during the mayor's time in London and three times for foreign trade delegations with Johnson.
The government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to Hacker House, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked puzzled questions about the survey process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arcuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among employees."
The move of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory authority touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence on any charges, and the prime minister has not been given the opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will see the political kyogen that was organized by amasama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Tourism and Regional Promotion Division, was "public secret."
The former staff of the London and Partners (L&P) stated that although there were people who considered the company "untrustworthy" at that time, they were privileged to accompany him to a foreign trade-related meeting led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Awakami Fund - Yahoo!
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, about the future prospects.
The Sawakami Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in 20 years of history.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the people involved, not the history that has only been achieved with the power of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing it for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from concerns about money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operations do not yield results unless they walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result was a 20-year long-term long-term fund, and we believe it was because we continued to be a direct sales system that delivered messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
Generally speaking, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why you can trust us.
mc. miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling fake tablets of oxycodon containing fentanyl, which Mr. Miller had previously held before he accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fentanil, but fentanil is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in detention, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutor in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to remain in custody until the start of the trial, citing the high possibility of escape from abroad.
There was no immediate response to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video to his Instagram and published a song called "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with recent opioid drug abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, also died of drug overdose in 2016 and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen instead of Steven.
over 30 mobile games developed by nineyearolds in nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hide-and-do game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats that come out of hiding places.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that "we spend time building games when we're bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in numerous mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was too obsessed with the game, so I got a bit angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but how about making games myself so that others can play it?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care about it."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to be a scientist in the future, has the name of his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it becomes African innovation, young people like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded a robot that uses program code to divide housework.
In May, Akrobo, a female high school team from Ghana, won the 2019 Robofest Contest.
Google and Microsoft giant technology companies have increased their investment in Africa, and Basil and his children are going to be future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely accused federal agents of corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which charges Hayes deems.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecution sued former Congressman Hayes for his involvement in the insurance company's plan to fund the state's director of insurance.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindbergh supported Republican ideas and politicians, but also donated money to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked him to comment by email on Friday, but he did not respond.
On Friday, Hayes' Defendant, Carns Davis, also received an email asking for additional comments, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken to Cosey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecution said Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cosey, and also spoke directly with the supervisor.
The indictment, published in April, claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to hold up to $2 million for Cosey's 2020 reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy was involved in the request of the authorities to replace Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported the alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no doubts.
The indictment described in a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cosey that Lindbergh's co-owner instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cosey's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would draw attention if he had moved so expensive money, but he eventually broke in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an email asking for further information on judicial transactions, but no response was made.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like other people's posts!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and can only be seen by posters.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia policy manager Mia Garrick said the change was based on feedback from mental health professionals who would consider the number of happy surveys and goodies to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had very positive feedback from a number of bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
It is only to delete numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchanges, rather than the number of nices and reactions.
Garrick said it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more securely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test was conducted.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test ends or whether it will remain unchanged.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experience, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very active "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram user.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder Part (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!
One day, I got my mother's favorite bag of gold and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
Candu's handcrafted parts helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying i'm not selling anymore
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pla product.
Therefore, if you ask the shop for repairs, the price of the main unit was significantly higher.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this connected fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, everything is silver color.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Candu with no help, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It is originally a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you line it up with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is attached immediately.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The metal fittings were increased, but the weight was not a problem at all because of the lightweight parts.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts has increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, the express train of the JNR, is a temporary train, Hiroshima-Kumamoto, a 10-hour trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
On the same day, about 240 people, including railway fans, boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo between 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" organized by JR companies, Japanese travel was organized.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo, Chikuho and Kagoshima lines.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother's life imprisonment for the honor murder of kandir barochi, a Pakistani social media star.
Candir Barochi, who gained fame with photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His older brother, Kandir Baroch, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted on Friday for his sister's murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment for the most popular "honorary murder" in Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by Baroch, who was famous for being provocative in Pakistan, which is very strong against women.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
His brother said in a press conference a few days later that he had murdered his sister, "Of course," and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar (the thought of God) will be innocent in the Supreme Court," the lawyer said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar My, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"My son has no sin.
My daughter and my son."
Baroch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of his misrepresentation of the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "principal murders."
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed or strangled by crime, such as choosing their own marriage partner - in Barochi's case, praising their sexuality and exposing their families to shame.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow perpetrators to be forgiven from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring lifetime imprisonment for honor killings.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the murderer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, his parents changed their minds thinking that he would lose his son, and asked him to forgive him.
Due to international hatred of killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a bright red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
It became critical and threatening, but it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the expression of oneself as a presence like Kim Kardashian opened up new heaven and earth in a country considered to be a bold and political activity to improve the status of women.
The origins of the "principal" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

Kenichiro Shigeki "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo!News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Shigeki has been thinking twice about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will send you a piece later.
In the first part (see related article), Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko stick to the traditional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool man.
if you're bound by what you should do, you'll get to live.
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about the need to look at various works and behavior of people and learn patterns every day.
When we learn patterns, we think that brains can systematically act in such a situation, so we can live in comfort.
I think I am still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I am "mote."
That's why it's easy to live.
I was teaching at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you're sticking to the old pattern of "a university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will survive.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
In my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is, I talked like that very much.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally around him.
It's not that easy.
It's painful to ask yourself around.
Isn't Takeshi doing this at the Cannes Film Festival?
Although he is light, his surroundings will be treated as "a wonderful film director."
If you have a track record, you don't have to act great.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," it is not easy.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of position or age, it seems that any man is "cute" and can be saved.
It is difficult to say what this "cute" is.
what is it?
In the northwestern part of Nigeria, the number of refugees doubled to 40,000: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's Friday announcement, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 due to intensified violence in the last four months.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created, and by the end of this year, a new $35.5 million fund-raising activity is needed.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist organization that has been working on anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Nigeria over the past ten months in Sokot, Zamfara and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"We often show the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok said to the press on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, robberies, murder and sexual violence were frequent, and raiders destroyed residences and worked on theft.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Boko Haram and the West African branch of Islamic State, which broke out in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," Barrok says.
What they bring is a terrifying experience story.
Most of the refugees passed to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR stated in a statement that the security situation in Sokot, especially, was deteriorating, and that refugees going to Niger would increase in the coming months.
the new trial date for a man who killed two women and two children is confirmed.
The date of trial for Guatemalan men allegedly killed two women and two children in Iowa was confirmed.
According to Polk County Court records, Marvin Escobar Ollyana (31) was indicted for the first-class murder in three cases under the false name of Marvin Eskibel Lopez, who was initially referred to by the police as the authorities.
He claims not guilty.
According to the police, on 16 July, he shot Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29) and her daughter (11) and son (5) in the house of Demoin.
The court records that the date of the trial will be decided on January 27, giving the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare.
According to officials of the U.S. Immigration Customs Bureau, Escobar Ollyana was illegally staying in the U.S. and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.
The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising in header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their needs.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system in which multiple bidders (advertisers) compete in fair bids to prioritize high-priced ads to media operated by media companies.
As a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
In the past, SSP has been providing advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers that "I want to deliver to a specific advertising frame with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP started in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, directly purchasing advertising frames in line with advertisers' requests.
This time, the introduction of LFP will be expanded by supporting header binding.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP header bids allow them to participate directly in bidding for header bids.
In addition, because the target media company is limited, the advertising frame of the destination according to individual commercial materials and brand image is secured, preventing brand value loss.
One of the advantages of media companies is that it is possible to implement initiatives in line with the expectation of the introduction of media companies through a solution that manages the code of the bidder companies called " wrapper solutions" that LFP promotes collaboration.

Two-month suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that a male assistant professor working at Yonezawa Campus (Yonezawa City) was suspended for two months.
The punishment was the same date.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Assistant Professors of the Department of Internal Affairs and Communications, from around October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, were emotional and abused in inappropriate words.
He was a teacher of education and was recognized as having deteriorated the educational environment.
A survey conducted in September 18 appealed to several students.
The management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and from December of the same year, an investigation was conducted at the Harasssment Prevention Committee by faculty members at Yonezawa Campus.
In response to the findings of the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
Even after the survey, the male assistant professor continued his education, but through the interview, his actions were improved and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to make every effort to prevent harassment and restore confidence."

Cabinet Revolts Boris Johnson demands a compromise with the EU to reduce the EU's withdrawal demands.
Just three weeks after the conclusion of the EU summit, concerns surrounding the Prime Minister are growing that the Prime Minister may be out of time to withdraw significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of withdrawal from the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations have been jammed over a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clause on the Irish border, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative to "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany will propose a compromise proposal on the ground, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the Senior Advisor Dominique Cummings, and insist that the EU accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One cabinet member said that the Supreme Court's ruling that the closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday was "a warning," and that "the compromise is the only way we can leave on October 31."
We will never win in the House of Representatives, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister shall use whatever is available from his steps.
It is not effective even if it becomes radical, and the Cammings project is clearly failing.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to implement the previous Prime Minister's agreement, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are a number of reasons for this, and everyone is trying to end this.
If we postpone it, Boris is over and we are all over.
Sir John Mayer accused Boris of not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a harsh speech, said: "The Prime Minister wants to make an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to form an agreement.
Instead, we saw the Prime Minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs with the Whales, and discussing with the people on the streets - as if the election campaign was full-fledged."
The prime minister's press yesterday acknowledged that the agreement was still a long way ahead, saying, "No one can think of it - if it is to achieve the goal, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which would force a three-month postponement in the event of an unconstitutional withdrawal, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that the bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue moving forward despite the bill's enactment."
Stephen Berkeley, Minister of Departure of the European Union, returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by the television boss that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, 59 years old, said he was "very nervous."
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone on the TV-am team and to see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis that morning.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my favorite place is here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly hosted the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorraine.
To celebrate the 35th anniversary, she will broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
"The passion and enthusiasm" and "the curiosity" were the secret to survival in the television industry, and the moderator said, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and honest.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think many of the families of children who were killed or injured watched us broadcast the show live from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, one of his mother's five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, personally told me to meet me, so we talked for hours at her house.
Not taking it all on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and that "we really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the pain and pain of the net that they do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, fear of traps, chiwenga.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of a presidential post from the late President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to fears that it might be a trap to refute military action in November 2017.
During the coup d'état, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Chiwenga declined the offer, not because of anxiety, but because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform leaders and African Unions around the world that the coup was deprivation.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirms that officials are senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munnagawa," it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was carried out by three persons.
President Spokesman George Charanba, then head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Nepera, and Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Muconoli, were involved in the negotiations, and officials said.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the president's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to denounce military action by the African Union, seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the president to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was a wasteful act to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there was a little political aim of the late president who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If there was anything to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I want you to remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would be trapped, and would crush the claims of the commanders claiming that he did not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had yet to decide whether to position the situation as a coup without fully grasping the entire situation, would eventually be called a coup and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that they would not turn guns to the citizens, even if they had invaded the presidential house called Blue Roof.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things to protect his family and to prove the deprivation of power by the military.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
A strong metaphorical expression was used in the words of an emissary (gono) telling the president's desperate message: "We belong to the camouflage group, the military department, and we are not politicians or political competition."
The Army told the other commanders of the region that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coup and successors, Mugabe attempted to bring back Munnagagwa, who had been short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at the time, South Africans who were key to this process refused to intervene, but as repeatedly threatened behind it, it was clear that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military entered the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources tell the Independent.
The second atomic bomb at the United Nations appeals to the ban on nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th, a meeting was held at the UN headquarters in New York to aim for a world free of nuclear weapons.
Five countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and 32 countries and territories were ratified.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
Secretary-General Guterres also spoke and expressed strong concern over recent years that there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is no other way to abolish it."
China needs strong leadership.
Prior to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In a white paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party's administration 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complex, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will lead to division and collapse, and it will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the repression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who will play the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he took power in late 2012.
Xi also oversees military modernization programs threatening the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development models, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but rather merely seek peace.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or control of the world.
In modern times, China was bullied by the powerful, and war and confusion left a deep scar with that pain; China would never bring the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in China's Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "delete" its nuclear interests, nor allow it to undermine security and sovereignty.
"The threat of trade wars and rising tariffs are no problem-solving," White Paper states in relation to trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities and opening new worlds.
China has no idea of countering the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., so the U.S. should take a calm look at the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more unlikely that China will stop its development.
The U.S. will not maintain its strength if it suppresses, suppresses, and moves domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko.
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as the coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local newspaper had a rumor about baseball club members.
After hearing the situation from the two students, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the protest.
In addition, based on the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they generally accepted the facts and dismissed them on 28th.
In the summer of 15th, Motochika WATANABE (74), who was raised by Daisuke MATSUSAKA and others, retired.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
From summer 16 to summer, he participated in Koshien in summer for three consecutive years, and this spring he also participated in Senbatsu.
However, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals this summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in the fall, and the Senbatsu tournament in the next spring was desperate.
Spice Girls' Mel C, eating disorders, eating disorders, etc.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom admitted that diets were banned at home from their own eating disorders, which over the years did not eat anything except fruit and vegetables.
Sporty spices, under pressure from members of the global pop group, have been "excessive exercise" for many years without having to eat enough, and have subsequently been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom told her that her experience was influenced by her daughter Scarlett's child-rearing, stating that "all topics related to diet in the family are prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his own appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was able to be very careful when talking to my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, still in front of SNS, a "bad" comment on himself written in the media led to physical problems, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, became more and more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin," Mel said.
I didn't feel well, and I've been in that state for almost a few years."
Judiciary judgment on same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch judged that this was a case where 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' was a matter of dispute between same sex.
More than 20 countries accept same-sex marriages, and local governments such as Sapporo City, which have no legal effect in Japan, have a system to certify same-sex partnerships.
The decision was based on the fact that two women were actually married.
It is considered the first judicial decision to allow same-sex couples to have legal protection.
On the grounds of the Civil Code and the Family Register Act, the same-sex marriage is not permitted due to unconstitutional reasons.
We would like to deepen our understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system to recognize diverse families.
Women lived together for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the U.S., but the plaintiffs filed for damages to their former partners after they were found guilty.
The decision was based on the results of the two living together and recognized "the reality of the fact that marriage between men and women is no different."
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of actual marriage with the same-sex rights, such as social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that defines marriage as "only based on the agreement of both sexes."
Both sexes were "unpresumed to be same-sex marriage at the time of establishment, so it is not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
While the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for various same-sex marriage lawsuits.
On the other hand, since the same-sex marriage was not recognized, "the benefits of legal protection are different from that of men and women."
While recognizing the reality of equal status between men and women, it is difficult to distinguish the right to protect.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, 70 percent of people believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a legal spouse, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriages between same-sex couples but also the expansion of legal rights for actual marriages.
Trials and jury trials of former athletes prosecuted for rape by multiple women
A jury trial is held at the trial of former Delaware University baseball players who have been accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's life luck.
A 21-year-old woman tells her that she was sexually assaulted after she drove Conaway home.
The two met after three weeks at the meeting site Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Konaway has been charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women's paradoxical claims and misrepresentation might have regretted having physical relations.

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, the video clearly shows
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $2109 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, Circler Keys, Luna Park and some famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with halves, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes lost by someone, and even animal corpses - all inflowing into Sydney Harbour by rainwater flowing through the road.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor that clogs waterways.
In a video released on September 27, coincidentally on the day of world tourism, Dr. Catherine Dafoon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most modified and contaminated estuaries of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour is expected to flow into the waterways, most of which flow through the rainwater drain into Sydney Harbour.
"The heavy rains were falling several times, but Sydney Harbour was... quite tragic," Dr. Daffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what's there," said Richard Nichols, owner of the dive center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is underneath the water surface), I think everyone will be really surprised.
Although overwhelming, more than half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The other half is plastic at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing down the water immediately.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said that local residents and tourists can reduce the amount of plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles better, and eventually flows into the ocean, so you need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a food source.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it's very simple.
killing the sea is killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, coincided with the release of the video funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of a broader awareness of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between 12 and 18 years old have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also noted that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed were increasingly worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Station was demolished in October | Saga News|Saga Shimbun
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which began demolition work in October, is Futatako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) located in Futatako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantling was used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991 due to aging.
One chimney is broken down by a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
There was a sad voice, and a man in his 60s who ran a restaurant nearby said, "When I look back from the distance and see the chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port, and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Since Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station are nearby, the prefecture and the city are hoping to use the site.
Three people, including nine electric cars, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell their products.
I am now (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Maya Takahashi, a free announcer and monthly commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," spoke about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save my rotten self.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is beyond his father and is like a master.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I am different from what I am doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was struck by the fact that I was called "cone" or "busaik," my father said, "I thought it was "cone, but it wasn't."
Then, around the second or third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty woman can do it," and even when I didn't get motivated because I didn't want to do the job I wanted to do, and my heart was rotting, "Who can do the job is hard to do.If so,"I asked Mama to do it, but I was happy to be in charge of it.
i learned naturally from my father's acting.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but in fact, after joining the TV station, I've been in touch with the news all the time with the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe was happy and confident that he was "good at reading Mama news."
When I read the news, I feel it's important and sensed.
It has been cultivated through watching father's stage, film, television, and period dramas as a child.
More importantly, I think that my father's work on variety shows and how to deal with them is thanks to various experiences of my childhood.
Experience the 300-year history of kumidori / Education Promotion Project | Miyako Mainichi Shimbun Website - The latest news on Miyakojima is packed!
Workshops in Kagamihara
The workshop on the role and effect of five musical instruments played in kumidori was introduced on 26th.
A group dance workshop (hosted by the Prefectural Board of Education Education Agency) was held at Kagamihara Junior High School on June 26.
All students attended and learned about the 300-year history and birth of kumidori, as well as the acoustic effects and use of musical instruments played.
In the workshop, members of the OB Group, Department of Ryukyu Performing Arts, Prefectural University of the Arts, presented the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing three lines, koto, drums, kokyu and flutes.
The host was from Miyakojima City, and Mr. Kawamitsu served as the host of the OB Association.
In this workshop, I learned how five types of musical instruments are represented in dance by taking up "music" among the three components of kumidori (music, chanting, Ryukyu dance).

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
It is the first edition of the New York Times (New York) - Yahoo!
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The International Automobile Federation announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Looking back on past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18 pieces.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships under the jurisdiction of the International Automobile Federation (FIA).
Since 1973, the race has been held every year, becoming the world's highest rally championship, boasting history and tradition.The competition is said to be the most challenging car competition because it runs at high speed on various roads such as gravel and snow roads as well as closed public roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Invitation Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, talked about the Japan Round.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura

is tasmaniadeville the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmanian devil may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers are opening a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient treatment.
Medical researchers have found out how some cancer cells camouflage.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmania and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will lead to new treatments for cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there are cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change their treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing fatal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils on the verge of extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags would no longer respond to markers due to camflage using a series of proteins called PRC2, and the immune system would not attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and melkel cells.
Peter McCallum researcher Mark Dawson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Traditional treatments may be reused to revitalize markers, or proteins known as MHC, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where cancer cells escape detection in the same way.
"Unsurprisingly, the exact same process occurs in human and Tasmanian devil cancer," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
But if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, they may be useful for controlling tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-shaped planets orbit around small stars called red dwarfs, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting its main star, Red dwarf.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not large, researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12 percent the size of the Sun, but the planet orbiting around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, led this research published in the journal Science.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, it is almost the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 degrees Celsius (6380 degrees Celsius/3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I have a reddish color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining its elliptical orbit.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which created their own orbiting stars.
The most influential model of planetary formation, called the "core accumulation" model, is that the object is formed from solid particles in the disk, and the gravity produced by the egg of the planet causes the surrounding gas to become atmospheric.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature might have been lower," says Morales.
In this state, the disk becomes unstable, so some dense areas may appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant bean dip, was eaten by his colleagues and charged.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating a dip of beans with a wake-up to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was charged with the transfer of methane fetamine, a Class B felony, and suspected of taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit obtained from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returns to work, her stomach gets worse and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have contained methane phetamine in soy dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee told Medina Hernández that he had "druged" the victim's food, while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he had accidentally put methane fetamine in the bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows Medina Hernández pointing his back to the camera and clinginging behind the microwave but extracting something from the brazier.
It is said that he stood up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table and put a bean dip in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff, at present, did not think there were customers who had contaminated food.
Medina Hernández was detained in Marion County jail instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gunn, Medina Hernández's long-term arrest record includes assault, robbery, spoofing, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

The prefecture is concerned that the spring water that came out during the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
With regard to changing the construction method for this response, he said, "If there is something practical, I will do it, but I think it is difficult to think from the safety side of construction."
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the route change mentioned was "not possible."
President Kaneko pointed out three locations: South Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station, which are particularly time-consuming for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Administrative and Social News|Saga Shimbun
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare needed to reorganize and consolidate the hospital, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced the hospital's name on September 26.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in Japan, and three have already been integrated and transferred.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Tatara-cho, Fujitsu County.

Washington (AP) - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Commission dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel, citing questioning the suitability of the owner.
On Wednesday, three MPs, two former judges and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on a state law requiring the applicant's "appropriateness" to obtain a liquor license.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year claimed that President Trump's assault charges and repeated frauds violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the license was already approved.
This was the second time an appeal was made to update the permit.
The honey collected by Bentley's Flying Bees is the first harvest!
How do you taste honey collected by Flying Bees bred at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September 2019.
More than 100 bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the premises of a factory that assembles cars?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honeys produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing division, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we set up a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers watched the bees from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains collecting various flowers.
It was found that this place was suitable for beekeeping, and it was wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been engaged in a wide range of activities to become the top sustainable luxury car manufacturer through its Crew Factory and our business.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of bentra honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to fulfill our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million honey bees "Flying Bees" were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, it was completed to remove the nest from the nest box and put the nest frame into a centrifugal separator and filtered the fallen honey.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley's signature.
The label was designed by Louise McCallum, a designer in charge of Bentley interiors.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we also want to enjoy afternoon tea with "Flying Bees" honey in scones and other places.
The Cleveland Police, a series of scandalous reports, is the worst in Britain.
A police officer was named the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police Department says that serious deterioration continues.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to stop the crime, arrest the suspect, and protect the socially vulnerable.
Phil Gomley of the Police Directorate said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Mike Wiel, Chief of Police, resigned in January less than a year after his inauguration, but was subjected to "deep" investigation of his actions, but several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal activities.
Lieutenant Simon Herwood, last year, went to the Investigation Commission for Illegal Practices, for the reason that he directed his colleagues to act sexually.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Interior Ministry intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I have full responsibility for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal," and impeachment must be settled.
Nobody knows what will happen next.
At present, we believe that we are involved in the cover-up case, and it may take some time to investigate it."
"I'm going to do a job that I'm starting to do based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Vladimir Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his own personal adviser, Rudy Giulani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security lawyer in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before formal inquiries.
The Ministry of Justice, charged with inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of violations of political funds.
In response to Barr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee would decide who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the telephone talks with the President of Ukraine in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision regarding the disposal of the charges.
Perosi said that he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower, as Trump attacked the whistleblower as a spy on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump on charges of pressure on foreign leaders for political gain and noted a historic step.
The call was included in the accusations released on Thursday, in which the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his authority to "see intervention" in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed to have instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-level computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace Forward Christian Bentek, speed violation prohibited driving
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.
The 28-year-old forward at Crystal Palace confirmed on January 20, that he drove his Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 speed limit in Richmond, southwest London.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu is concerned about the composition of the judging committee.
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Cécondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the upcoming GFA elections.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davies and expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In his interview with GNA Sport, Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the results of the review process and that it was fair or doubtful to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside of the previous interest, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kwak Palmer about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic champion.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if Mr. Fred Papoe, Executive Director of the Olympic Games, attended the committee, there would be conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer, Chairman of the Board.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Appocavi, a sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage to be "at least 1,000 yen."
While 90% of companies applied for recruitment in fiscal 2018, the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and middle-aged employees, and only 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded that they "approved" to raise the yen to 1,000 yen per hour, including information related (100 percent), construction (70,6%), and wholesale (61,7%).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink, and lodging.
The representative of the meeting said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a high tendency to oppose in industries where part-time and hourly wages are high."
On the other hand, the average amount of money paid was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, there were 61.3% of regular employees, 54.5% middle-time employees, and 15.4% non-regular employees.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (37.5%, 37.5%) and construction industry (24.1%, 38.1%) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% had challenges in hiring, and in many cases, the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for new graduates (departure within three years after graduation) and mid-career recruitment.
There were also opinions that sought to support students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied, "We already accept it."
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one-third of the total showed acceptance.
There were 64.4% of companies that were "not admitted" and high construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%) and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the decisive battle with the Australians
Justin Tiprick said that Wales will be hosting the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Wallabeads, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will likely be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory over Wales was the 14th victory, Tiprick and his team would be the best eight straight line against England.
"It's a matter of course, I want to challenge both teams to win and finish at the top of the group," said Tiprick, a Welshman.
Until now, the fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last fall.
I think Australia will be quite blamed for returning the loan, but I will do my best to win it again.
I knew this game was a mountain before I came here.
And now I'm here, it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Wales has won the third place since 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gutland, all three Southern Hemisphere heavyweight teams won only seven out of 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was one of the top players to play at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
Surely, the game was tough, and maybe I thought that everyone could win, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
In order to win Wales, the key is the break-down battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Law.
Up until now, Tiplic has played 67 international matches, and has fought several games and both players in the past.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you will always know that you will be facing a tough game from now on.
They are always the best in the world.
I am fully aware of what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the world's most defensive backs players, and Michael is an aggressive backsman, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when necessary.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself rather than confronting the very strong Bucklow.
I want to fight with the best opponents, and if I play against those two, I have to prepare myself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to build up a good performance, you will be able to play a game that won't lose.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brought '90 percent of the gala', would it really be a gift from a comedian?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said at a press conference on July 22, "The company is 9 and there is no talent 1 or so at all."
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the "9:1" ratio, it would be considered that there was a gift from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and investors' views that taxes would be paid were also tweeted on Twitter.
If Gyara's share is "9:1," does it cost a gift tax?
i heard from you.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer your question from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen is "9:1," the profit of 1 million yen in sales and 100,000 yen in expenses will be 9 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
Also, even if you think about the allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount I received is reported as sales.
The gift says that if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying or selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, the third party will not be able to decide on the amount of tax-appropriate price for those that both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen's payment statement is a pity.
Mr. Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working at a bank, he was registered as a tax accountant in 2008.
There are a wide range of activities such as university lecturers, seminars and writing.
It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for accounting beginners.
the white house, it's a panic.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and detailed officials in this issue explained that there was a sense of panic this week against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be increasing "confidents, anxiety, and worry" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers would damage the President and some surrounding persons.
He said, "I don't really think it's true."
The White House official joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, and that this claim was so serious that it could not be applied to the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far, that it was not something that would be erased from the next news.
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's uncontrollable response to the impeachment question would increase the likelihood of being "incompetent."
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised daily, and some close associates of the president are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has taken increasingly unpredictable actions and spurred concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about the president and politics in the election year environment.
Trump has faced the greatest threat ever seen in his presidential term, and has transformed his attackers and defenses, such as reviving strategies he judged effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Moller.
Trump attempted to disappoint the request of the President of Ukraine to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of whistleblowers as they were motivated by partisan conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the Morale trials, but this time they are starting to feel the difference.
The president, whose power is considered a brand, seemed to be coming to the press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but it seemed that he was not willing to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that damage can be mitigated, claiming that it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information about the controversial Trump and Vologzimir Zellensky and the Ukrainian president.
In addition, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategy close to the White House points out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and the effect of impeachment on new supporters is unlikely.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President for the next four months."
Another source of information stated that those claiming impeachment could be the help of the president did not fully grasp how uncertain the president's response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to an official who explained the plan, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as strategic decision rooms will be implemented and what kind of actions will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum that the publication and publication of critical internal accusations had given the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin stating that they cannot publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later.
According to a person involved in this case, the person who might be involved in the impeachment deployment is called Trump's external pitbull and Corrie Luwandowski, former head of the campaign headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never talked to the president or close adviser about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Cellow, has also been involved in impeachment efforts.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow replied, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left Pat Cipolon, now a White House lawyer with experience in impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy is generally aware that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but that they need people who are organized and can lead all-out response and political struggle.

The broadcast ended safely and went to Hokkaido with Chiyo (Kiyohara Maya).
The Shibata family was attacked by a power failure, and the latest farm facilities that were electrified were stopped.

"I was tired of my father and the rest of my life, and I will continue to be more active in Utchan."
"There were a lot of things over the last half of the year, but at the end I thought it was a good ending with a good feeling that it was well organized, and the performers and production staff were tired again, and the narration of Utchan saying that it would continue to be the 101st work of Morning Dora was good."
In addition, in the final episode, "It's lonely to see no natsuzozu from next week, my grandfather, thank you for half a year.""I'm lonely from tomorrow," "I'm lonely after all."

I was able to have a boyfriend because of his work, but for a long distance love ...
I said, "I'll marry someday," but I can't see the goal and I can't see it.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation with our allies to marriage?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice derived from detailed data analysis is mandatory.
what's this?
I am worried about whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during a long-distance relationship.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I work and my parents live, but his place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that "Let's get married in the future."
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from distant love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (--) C is in a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "the distance is tested and the two become stronger."
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) Speaking of distance love, the questionnaire survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous.
Since love is done with five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touch), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to the other person's house, you will be burdened with time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if you are on a holiday to heal the tiredness of your work, your body is cum.
I feel refreshed when I return home.
Isn't it necessary to break up after a long distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently, or a couple whose time is determined beforehand.
You'll be engaged a year later, or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult to find a future landing point.

Debbie Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump will be investigating.
Thursday, in a comment defending the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain presidential nude photos.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive at the House of Representatives Information Special Committee, filed in the opening statement of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had requested to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the president's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos," he said.
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Senator Nunes ended, Huffpost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to find out if the Democratic Party was looking for the truth.
Only Congressman Jim Heims of the Connecticut Democratic Party has responded so far, but many other members are questioning whether the answer is red-naked truth.
Memediate.com speculates that Nunes' Noudist comments may be related to the "more detailed and unconfirmed" part of Steele's controversial document.
It is a notorious report in which former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected by Trump watching prostitutes urinate in a hotel in Moscow.

Regenerative biofuel research can reduce emissions
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only airplane to fly in the sky and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid waste such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude fuel, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology achieved (actually generated) is hydrocarbons of molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is like a dilemma," Bressler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low-risk approach that requires different treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bressler described the second option: "You can try it in a reactor to change a little chemical reaction."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the US Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Currently, Foge operates a testing plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a 25 million US production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bressler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but there is no reduction in fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bressler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple choices can be made in parallel with the decisions made after the explanation.

Boris Johnson warned that if Brexit was overturned, the British would face riots like Los Angeles, and the prime minister would call for calm.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of a "strong uprising by the people" in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson stated that he needed to "quench anger" against the political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but insisted that he would not use the term "defeat."
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain calm, one minister told the Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gilles Joan (yellow vest) or the Los Angeles riots of 1992.
People do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when the jury passed a verdict of innocence to four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King.
This year, the French anti-government demonstrators Gire Joan, wearing the eye-catching yellow vest, have been causing confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters oppose withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people will not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a danger of "a violent uprising by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to hold a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a House Revolt demanding a withdrawal from the EU and instead seeking a compromise with the EU.
TeNY TV Niigata - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, Niigata Albirex BB, a professional basketball player, prayed for a victory over a week before the B League began.
Niigata Albirex BB players and staff prayed for victory at Komachi Shinmeigu Shrine in Niigata City on the morning of the 27th.
Last season, Niigata won the club's first district championship.
At the end of the season, however, Davante Gardner was transferred to other teams in the B league.
This season, with new foreign nationals, Nick Perkins, we aim to win more than last season's regional championship.
"It is important to increase the speed of the head coach's demand and the strength of the defense more than last season," said Jun Uzawa.
The opening match of Niigata will be played on Saturday, October 5 at Away against Albuquer Tokyo.
pakistan, brother of social media celebrity, was sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the case fades.
"It's too long, so people forget," said Farzana Bali, the first female rights activist at a university in Pakistan, who said it took more than three years to solve even Barochi's case, which is attracting attention.
Human rights groups say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but in 2018, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission discovered at least 300 "honored murders."
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much more than that, because it is estimated that Pakistan accounts for approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honor killings that honor-based violence monitoring organizations take place worldwide every year.
Anti-pork cholera measures 1.3 billion yen Add to the September supplementary plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo!

flood and chaos caused by prolonged monsoons in india
The monsoon season in India has been prolonged for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing buildings to collapse and death, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken in early September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37% higher.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues for a few days, the monsoon will weaken during the last few decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays destroyed buildings and killed several people.
The house was flooded, and the inhabitants crossed the street with water to their knees, usually seen only at the height of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Raknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
The prolonged monsoon is undesirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmhouse in Vimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "I'm currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the rain will rot the vegetables."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak Monsoon.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dashera on 8 October, and the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, who is the evil smile of the beard that appears in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, the last laugh may be Lavana.
[Sendai] Defeat Yokohama M with a Compact Defense Director Watanabe (Sport News) - Yahoo!
J1 Begalta Sendai held a private practice for 24 to 4 days (only 20 minutes at the beginning) for the 28th Battle of Home Yokohama M (at 7:00 p.m., Utah).
Yokohama M lost 15 points in the last three league games, but Shin Watanabe (45) responded by saying, "The players showed me a powerful, battle-like exercise."
Last season, he lost eight of his clubworth's eight games at home (July 18).
It is a difficult enemy to defeat in 1-2 this season.
Yokohama M, the third largest player in the league, currently ranked 14th in Sendai, ranks 48th in the league.
In addition to the 13-point FW Marcos Juniol (26), 10-point 7-assisted FW Nakagawa Teruto (27) and other strong front-line players, J's leading CB duo of Japan DF Hatakenaka Makinosuke (24) and Shunto Brazilian DF Chiago Multins (24) are also waiting.
Watanabe said, "There are plenty of aggressive play in and out, there are also speed CBs, we want to protect compact and fight with confidence without seeing tear."
The Emperor's Cup for the first time was defeated by J2 Nagasaki on the 18th, with only eight league games remaining.
The commander said, "It was a regrettable loss, and it is the most important thing to stand up from there."
It enhances the feeling and shows the results of countermeasures with pitch.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
Recent studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was a follow-up survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"This research highlights the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides at work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure at work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the research.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women or other races because it only targets Japanese Americans.
Due to the long half-life of pesticides, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year follow-up survey, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to aging and hiding the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone talks
The impeachment procedure for U.S. President Donald Trump was a radical week in Washington's political affairs.
For political beginners Vologzimir Zellensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
But what has been known about the Zellensky Trump telephone problem so far, and is there a wide range of influence on Zellensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had more conveniences in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's 1000% argument is controversial.
Zelensky added that President Macron and Merkel both did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no previous support from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the EU's support including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Voytica, said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scolded military aid and asked Selensky to investigate two rather than one, one against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the other about the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic e-mail fraud during the 2016 election.
It is uncertain whether this would hinder European relations or lay backwater against French and German leaders.
I don't want to say bad about anyone.
"I would like to thank the people who helped me with the announcement of the call," Zerensky said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana with an interim implementation rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification survey (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Organization's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was recognized by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO regarding safety at airports and in their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of ICAO's delayed national zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for security evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director General of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador to Ghana to Canada Nii Icoi Otou, and Director of Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Bennard Aliou stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to always be aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada also said that this award complements the sector's inconsistency and perseverance and is a gift of Ghana's efforts.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

The Department of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, determined that Mr. Long had illegally used government vehicles to commute to work between Washington and his home, Norcarorina.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, raised doubts about drunkenness and involvement in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of the month after consideration.
Mr. Gino's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Bureau in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying activities in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of betanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found in an office building at 9600 blocks on Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found equipment for filling the beep cartridge.
"This process is very dangerous," said Cano.
Capt. Cano had previously been involved in narcotics investigations, stating that there was a possibility of a fire in the process of extracting oil used for the beep product.
"Only static electricity from clothes can be ignited, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fire but also explosions," says Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions and fires one after another.
The hazardous materials processing unit was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
An anonymous information was received and it led to an investigation warrant on the site that found illegal activity.
The investigators are still pursuing who is the black curtain of illegal baptism.
The police said that Zhang himself believed that the office had a store in the office because the office was empty.
As the investigation continued, the police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to prevent illegal bating products from appearing again.
Captain Kano said, "It's really real or it's a substitute that you don't know."
Products may be mixed with other hazardous substances.
It may have a significant impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a big earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6!
Evacuation training at Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
In anticipation of an earthquake occurring during the concert, a practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City.
This training is held every year.
On stage, there is actually a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department, and it is assumed that a 6-strong earthquake will occur along the way of the song.
About 300 people including kindergarten children, local residents and hall staff participated in the training on the 27th.

The participants renewed their awareness of disaster prevention through training.
The lost dress of Elizabeth I, exhibited at Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver leaf threads, and lavish embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Elery Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, is determined to be one point.
This faded piece of cloth, hung on the wall of a small church in one countryside, is said to have been placed there 100 years ago, and is considered part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally discovered this gorgeous cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly the room that the Tudor Queen might have worn over 450 years ago.
The only remaining part of the 16th century dress is that it was an important discovery of the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of her sleeves, three years of research has increased the confidence of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The exquisitely expensive textile "silver silk cloth" was prepared by law only for senior members of the royal family, but also embroidered plants and flowers of the "name" quality suggest that the later additions of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears were noble persons.
It is believed that the dress was equivalent to a Tudor mansion at the time of its creation.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rivalries who wore such luxury clothing could not stand.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
I was always very happy to see the cloth and say, "It's amazing."
A long second life of a piece of dress that was cut and used as an altarpiece in the church of St. Faith in Baxton is not as expected.
Baxton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and a local legend says that the cloth has long been associated with Parry.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley before Elizabeth died in 1603.
Over 1000 hours of repair, 400 hours of specially dyed silk and fine surgical needles were spent on very delicate hand-sewing altar cloths, which will be displayed next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and led by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you'll feel really respectable to the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the front and back, you will find a great respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched" A week after the missing girl, the Self-Defense Forces withdraw Volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 days to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk such as mountain slopes and Sawa, but they could not find clues.
On the 27th, we were unable to find the whereabouts of 20-year-old men who volunteered to participate in the search.
The police and fire department will continue to search from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral speech by Miyazaki - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech in the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for election invalidation because the value of one vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member was the lowest in the country in the election held in July this year.
In the first oral speech held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendant's side called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It is not said that the issue of constitutionality was in a significant inequality, but should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

Arriving at Space Station, Unmanned Supply Vehicle Catch with Robot Arm | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
Konotori No. 8 was an unmanned supply vehicle that arrived at the International Space Station.
From the bottom left, the station's robotic arm is growing.
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th.
On the night of the 28th, Astronaut Konotori No. 8 (JAXA) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) of about 400 km altitude arrived near the station.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced with the control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the difference in speed and approaches about 10 meters away.
The robot arm, 17 and 6 meters long, grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching it to the station, the flight crew carries the luggage.
one third of the drug in the united states
Chicago Immediately after the sunrise on the Chicago West Side, CBS News captured rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNnight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of overdose.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king Nemecio Cervantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Matthew Donahew DEA executive officer in Mexico said, "Mencho is DEA and, in fact, the top priority of the U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartels, Harrisco Nueva, are involved in at least one-third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "massive" cocaine, methane fetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho does not punish and dies his empire.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders involving drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing.
At the manufacturing site, the bag of cocaine is stamped by the smuggler.
More than one third is thought to be made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively take the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the past.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited version of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of the sequel to Last of As in February 2020.
Some of the video games of this new action game were shown to the fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
The last-of-as-a-part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortedog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous work, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell stories with so many characters.
I didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but it eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all the other sections started."
The game was so spectacular that it didn't enter a single Blu-ray that it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
There is no need to ruin this surprise, but Easter eggs in the game contain nostalgic Noty Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered with PS Plus and prepare for the sequel release.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
MLB The Show 19 will be released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like Last of As Remastered and want to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including a replica of the popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet, a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Save" Council Trial Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th day of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, the Notoshima Regional Development Council (Notoshima Regional Development Council) was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings, and food crossed the Somachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
There were also products that sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents asked for continued "help" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including general vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpira gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
In the town of Suso, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Ms. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
Users also received orders such as "I want to have coffee that I drip by myself rather than canned coffee."
The council will consider what was requested.
At present, there is only one convenience store in Noto Island where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to buy and sell goods to help "shopping weak."
Until December, the 20 town councils in the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to add about $100 million to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been reviewed significantly to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be allocated to drought-affected residents' support organizations, and the target farmers will receive up to $3,000 emergency assistance.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will be assisted with drought relief funds up to $100 million for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted more than $7 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife's family in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen, Katie Stay, and four of his five children.
Haskell told the authorities that on July 9, 2014, he was pushed into the residence of Mr. Stay and questioned the whereabouts of his wife Melanie Haskell.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department said Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old son, 9 and 7 years old daughter died.
Only one person in his family, Kashdi Stie, who was 15 years old at the time, died.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed from office until Monday.
"If you choose to disappoint us, you will never forgive us."
I wonder if the appeal of the girl who shook her voice with anger resonated with the leaders of each country.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people, who raised anxiety and frustration, protested all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people from over 150 countries participated.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than two degrees, if possible, to 1 or 5 degrees.
All participating countries will take measures that are determined by each country without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to be related to global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is frequently observed in various places.
In order to achieve a faster pace of global warming, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit held by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal of virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new targets, and the sluggishness in the movement of the emission powers has become conspicuous.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy sets zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years" is large.
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's efforts at the environmental-related meeting, said at a conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of the girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wound, which is not controversial, is nothing more than the "replacement of the issue" that the person himself opposes.
The international community has to deal with the common crisis of humanity.
We can't expect the effectiveness of each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
In order to avoid taking away that future, adults should act.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The results of the U.S. Army research have led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such an Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and timekeeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute Distributed Quantum Information Center of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at the University of Innsbruck achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and measured in one, even if one quantum bit is physically far from the other, the measurement results in the other are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is twice as large as the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, which published results in Nature's quantum information.
Intercity quantum networks can be said to be composed of networks between physical quantum bitpoints in entangled states despite their large distances.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum internet.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains enough quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and at the same time excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed into optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
In his team, he first sent light particles through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nm, the optimal value for long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
In the measurement results, atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured simultaneously with high-quality "clock" quantum bits, which lead to the realization of entangled networks in long-distance atomic clocks.
The large entangled clock network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate position measurement, navigation and time-keeping applications," said Dr. Frederick Fatemi, an Army researcher who co-operated this program.
