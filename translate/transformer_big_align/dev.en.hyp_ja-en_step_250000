Croatia plans nuclear treatment facilities, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina to protest the Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in Novi Grad, a town in Bosnia, strongly urged Croatia to abandon plans to store the site of the barracks in Trugovska Gola, and to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote "Don't take a healthy future" and "Don't stop it."
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grad, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss the expansion of waste treatment facilities next week.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or to pay the cost of the waste of Croatia being processed at newly constructed facilities.
Tomislav Chorich, Minister of Environment and Energy of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia wanted to find another location on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would Bosnian pants pocket - the Turkovska Gola - be the best place in Croatia?"

PayPay salesman "Get on the waves" "Get on the waves" cashless wake up "Running Introduction" Will the waves swell (Tokai TV) - Yahoo!
Tax increase starting in October.
In line with this, the country will start a cashless point reduction project.
Reducing up to 5% to reduce the coldness of consumption is "cashless."
[See in the image] just before the tax hike... shops, businesses and cashless introductions
So what's happening now is "introduction."
It is a cashless store that had been a cash business until now.
We were close to the installation site.
[Cashlessing] immediately before the tax increase
"Okakiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular restaurant operated by Takeshin Seika, and there are more than 100 kinds of Okaki and Amatsu in the store.
Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users, visited Tatsushin on this day.
PayPay Yasuda: Are there any other payment methods besides cash?
Mr. Shinmi, President of Takeyoshi Co., Ltd.: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I wonder if the cash register will turn faster because it will not be possible to receive the tsurisen, but if you get used to it, it will be easier than cash."
To date, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce 20% of the usage by points.
Although the number of users has increased dramatically, Mr. Yasuda is an "employee man" who sells the introduction of PayPay to customers, that is, stores.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business so far.
The president also listened to Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's peak now.If you don't have a chance to talk about it before you jump into the store, or if you're going to do a consumer reduction business together, you'll be registered as a member of PayPay, and now you're riding a wave."
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the national consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves: "Consumer reduction business" in the country.
With the consumption tax increase since October, the country has introduced a system to reduce the maximum amount of shopping to consumers by 5% to prevent the cooling of consumption.
Like "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before the tax hike.

What is the representative Münchhausen syndrome that appeared in The Politician of Netflix?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are ill.
The Politician is broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, the president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinnes Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, even though the person under their protection is not seriously ill.
There are various types of pathologies, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is false that he is also ill.
However, the surrogacy of Münchhausen syndrome implies that others who are clearly under their protection are ill.
It is also known as FII, forgery or induced disease, and is a type of child abuse.
Although it is a rare symptom, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if children are ill.
So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS lists the following items as caution.
Children are healthy, but if they are ill, they try to persuade medical practitioners.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make the child feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Excessive medications and other drugs cause symptoms of the disease.
How general is Muhnhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 in two years.
what should we do if we suspect child damage?

Nigeria: Police raids on caduna schools, rescue 300 children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police conducted a forced investigation yesterday at the Imam Ahmed Bun Hanbar School in Rain Maidhuven Tunma, Igabi, arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
Police said that the children were inhumane, but the school denied this claim.
The residents, who call themselves the school pastor, say, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
Parents come to deliver meals to their children every day, so they know what kind of environment it is.
I was very surprised to have closed the school after the police came and evacuated the children, and all the food the parents delivered left.
Even though there are parents who can testify to the terrible environment the police say, this is unfair."
He adds that Abduraman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
It is also said that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhumane environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Central Coast's "super villainous" camouflage girl rape, court order to confront victims.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending a school in Central Coast, Kentucky.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to wood and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, a house search warrant was issued and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges of assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking the path, and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and knife suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl asked him to stop, stop, stop, and stop, the man put a head lock on the girl and forcibly brought him into the woods.
The man said to the girl, "Don't speak loud.
He said, "If you're going to do that, you'll have to do it."
The man had a knife on his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with cable tie, then hit the tree and abused for nearly an hour.
When a man spilled the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., with several phone calls and phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood out on clothes such as mud, grass, and trees, and was involved in street violence, and when he was chasing the driver to the bush, he claimed that he had fallen by mud.
The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, warning IT representatives that AI development is based on public interests
On Friday, Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats and investors that if there was no moral assessment of public interests, the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference, where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
A few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited to the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age."
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and the responses of social media companies during the atrocities were also verified.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances are causing increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not the right true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will go back to a certain kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, we would like to use the expertise of the participants to find people who can become future advisors to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.

Real Madrid loan player Martin Woodegor, and fan excitement with an assist.
Martin Woodegor was surprised by Michel Oyalsabar's preemptive support.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, breaking the record in the domestic season and making it the top spot in La Liga.
However, this season, despite not losing one game at La Liga, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, the pressure seemed to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Woodegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves, was surprised by Michel Oyarsabal's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, was a dribbling opponent's crotch and sent an exquisite pass through the inside of another two players to Oyalu Sabal, where he scored the goal by receiving this exact slew ball.
With the second goal of Willian José and the third goal of the stunning Oyalusabal penalty spot, he secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanol team just before Alaves' midfielder Manu Garcia left 5 minutes before the end.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015 but struggled to demonstrate his reputation.
The young Norwegian, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated this territory.
Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When we got in touch with this lawsuit, Sharad Powerle's name was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leadership of Sharad Powerl of the National Congress Party (NCP) in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Office (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Ajit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police primary report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit came in contact, Sharad Powerl's name was nowhere.
An executive's lawsuits and suspicions that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name emerged and who mentioned it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerl, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the joint bank, and questioned the timing of the filing of a lawsuit just weeks before the October 21 Maharashtra parliamentary election.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, declaring that he would not surrender before the "kingdom" of Delhi.
NCP called the action by the Executive Bureau a political abbreviation.

According to Colonel Tembeka Mbere, a spokesman for the Kuwazulu Natal police, a 20-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday.
The police said in this week that he was stabbed under the left and abdomen.
Drov is said to have been a customer at the Musinga Drifkarna Motorsports event on Saturday evening.
In a statement issued on that day, the organizers of the motor sports event stated in a preliminary report that the customer factor remained after the event's work to watch the music performance.
Unfortunately, one of them was attacked by strangers on the way, and then died in a hospital.
In response to her death, UKZN temporarily suspended academic activities on Friday, stating that "We need to consider the frailty of life as a community and the brutality that often occurs in this society."

The company agreed to pay $30 million in settlement for the failure of investors to disclose information about the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation on the presence of overclaims on epipenes against Medicade.
On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had classified epipens as generics in the Medicaid drug rebate program.

Stepping the accelerator pedal eliminates accidents!
The following four categories are available: Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by a mistake in driving.
Among them, accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistakes by elderly drivers are on an increasing trend.
Especially when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes panic and the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
There are new cars equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such errors, but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended vehicles.
After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and it will step at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform the pedal mistake from a new perspective.
It is to avoid pedal mistakes with "an alarm sound."
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
It is to react to sound and encourage the accelerator to return, and to avoid rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping.
It is difficult to understand changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who can hear easily.
It is attached to the OBDII connector, and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excl. tax) and it is easy to set up.
[Ashimo Watching-kun] The World Wing started selling in mid-September with the Ashimo Watch-Do-kun, an accelerator and brake step prevention device.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is plunged suddenly, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I did not tell the signal from the accelerator, and immediately controlled the rapid advance by turning it into a creep driving state (removing the brake in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h or more at the time of retreat (back) and force the vehicle to be cleaned up.
The mounting is only possible with capraon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

About 20 mothers who are raising children think about the form of disaster prevention suitable for each family and summarize their awareness and requests for local governments.
Mr. Saori Kusumoto (32) of Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked the nursery school suddenly lost their desire to go to the nursery school after the flood damage, and they began to be entertained at night.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up their homes and have not had enough time to face them," he said.
Yukari Ogushi (36) of Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families, including three-year-old children.
"If there is a child who can't stay still, I will use my mind around him."
A woman in the center of Saga City (45), with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he said, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the event of a disaster and have food and a simple toilet.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinako Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a child of 6 and 8 years old, proposed that "the elementary school had a closed school e-mail the previous day, but the nursery school had no communication network or email system.
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand the last time it was okay.I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
TANAKA said, "I will think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Arcuri Contact the police authorities
The IOPC will consider whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandals in London's mayor's office as violations of criminal law.
The Greater London Administration (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts of conduct" on suspicion of having received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists in the presence of information indicating that a crime could have been committed," says GLA.
This was never proven.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations made by the English and Welsh police.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the Chief of Police at the time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, although he claimed it was "a misconception."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but reports suggest that U.S. citizens who had moved to London seven years ago had received preferential treatment for U.S. citizens who were paid £126,000 from public money during the mayor's time in London, and joined three foreign trade delegations with Johnson.
The government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to the hacker house, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked puzzled questions about the survey process before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "regular proper assessment" and that the company owns the British telephone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Aculi (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businesswoman was "public secret among the staff."
The GLA's move to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence for any charges, and the Prime Minister has not given the opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will see the political kyogen that was created by the amasama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Department of Tourism and Regional Promotion, was "public secret."
L&P's former staff at London and Partners stated that despite some who considered the company "incredibly unreliable" at that time, he had the privilege of attending trade-related talks abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo!
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, about the future.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the past 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in 20 years of history.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the people involved, not the history that has been achieved with the power of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit has remained unchanged for 20 years.
If the general public is relieved from the anxiety of money, the world will be bright from the foundation, and we are working hard every day as a whole.
In the long term, operation does not yield results unless you walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result is a 20-year long-term long-term fund, and we believe it is because we continue to be a direct sales system that delivers messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just by telling the results, the information about what you're buying now is black box.
This is why you can trust us.
mc miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in overdose of drugs last year.
According to court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had in September last year before accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for the 2005 drug case, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutor in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the start of the trial, citing the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate reply to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video to his Instagram and published a song called "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died related to opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died of overdose in 2016 and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon inside.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games for nineyearolds in Nigeria
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch2 to create a hide-and-do game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats that come out of hiding places.
He learned how to make a game in a short intensive course.
Basil told CNN that he spent time building games when he was bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
At the age of seven, however, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing the tablet as usual, but I was too obsessed with the game, so I got a bit angry," his father said.
I was so frustrated that I said, "I'm always playing games, but what about making games myself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has the name of his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it becomes an innovation in Africa, young people like Basil take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded a robot that uses program code to organize household chores.
In May, Akrobo, a female high school team in Ghana, won the 2019 Robofest Contest.
Google and Microsoft giant technology companies are investing in Africa, and Basil-chan and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the Republican Party of North Carolina, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to court documents submitted on Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to testify against federal agents investigating corruption related to major political donors.
In the federal court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware of false statements against FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which charges Hayes deems.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor charged Hayes as being involved in a plan for a senior insurance company to fund the state's insurance director.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh, founder of insurance and investment companies, has donated over $5 million to state and federal election candidates and commissions since 2016, and has become the state's top political donor in recent years.
Lindbergh supported Republican principles and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked him to comment on Friday and email, but he did not respond.
On Friday, Hayes' Defendant, Carns Davis, also called for additional comments via email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken to Cosey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a factual document, Hayes actually spoke with the State Insurance Supervisor about a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh to the Insurance Bureau.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cosey, and also discussed direct bribes with his supervisor.
The indictment, published in April, claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business, and was planning to hold up to $2 million in his campaign to re-election in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for replacement of officials who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported suspected attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them stand.
Cozy has no suspicions.
The indictment described in a conversation, including Lindbergh and Cosey, that Lindbergh co-owners instructed Hayes to send $2.5 million to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would pay attention if he did so much money, but was eventually broken in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Attorney General of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office asked an email to provide detailed information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like other people's posts!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, seems to be personal and will only be seen by posters.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia policy manager Mia Garrick stated that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who consider the number of happy surveys and likes to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had very positive feedback from a number of bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."
It only removes numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchanges rather than the number of likes and reactions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more securely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
It is very early to say that the test is conducted in countries such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test will end or whether it will remain unchanged.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a step to listen and learn to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has very aggressive "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram users.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

Self repair of broken bag fittings to otok ♪ 【Cando】 "Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!
One day, I got my mother's favorite bag of gold and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag fittings are broken, you want to repair them somehow and continue to use them.
Cando's handcrafted parts helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying i'm not selling anymore
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pla product.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair, the price of the main unit greatly exceeded.
My mother unfortunately said, "Can I throw away ...," but I didn't want to give up.
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this connected fitting.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando for a bad time, I finally found it!
I was moved when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It is originally a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you align it with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is attached quickly.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So, I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The number of fittings has increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight has no problem at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, an express train of the JNR, is a temporary train from Hiroshima to Kumamoto for 10 hours | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
Those who enjoy a special train trip inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A special train, inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era, operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
Around 240 people, including railway fans, boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station on the same day, and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train that connected Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, the tour was organized by Japanese travelers.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo, Chikuho and Kagoshima lines.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother's life imprisonment for the honor murder of kandir barochi, a social media star in pakistan.
Candyle Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of his sister's murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment with the most popular "honorary murder" in Pakistan.
He was strangled to death in July 2016.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
He said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, "Of course," and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar (the servant of God) will be acquitted at the Supreme Court," the lawyer said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"My son has no sin.
My daughter and my son."
Barochi's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of neglecting the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "honorary murders."
Women have been burned down by crimes such as choosing their own marriage partner - in Barochi's case, appraising their sexuality and exposing their families to shame - killing, stabbed or strangled.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deya laws allow the perpetrators to be pardoned by relatives of the victims.
Three months after Barochi's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether the murder is an honorable crime, and the murderer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Barochi's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, his parents changed their minds and asked him to forgive him.
Due to international hatred of killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a bright red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although it became critical and threatening, it was recognized by many people, including young people, by opening up new heavens and earth in a country where expression of oneself as a presence like Kim Kardashian is considered a bold and political activity to improve the status of women.
The origins of "honorary" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

[Okinagarabu General Bureau] The NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda and Amami City) and the Okinagara Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda and Chinamachi) signed a partnership for the promotion of remote island sports on February 25.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects carried out by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish mutual support systems in terms of health management and prevention of injuries, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both groups mediate and send their trainers and instructors when training related to sports, and share information.
When a team from remote islands participates in a tournament outside the island, they will work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of the trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, we will cooperate with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association affiliated with the ASA, in the event of tournaments on the mainland, such as prefectural tournaments, to help prevent the performance of athletes from falling due to fatigue on board trips and consecutive nights.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima and Okinagarabejima, it is said that it will support players from outside the island by cooperating with local orthogonal hospitals and hospital officials.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Elabco in Chimei-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.

Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice as much about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will send you a piece later.
In the first part (see related article), Mr. Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko stick to the conventional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool guy.
if you're bound by what you should do, you're going to live.
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about the need to learn patterns daily by looking at various works and the behavior of people.
When pattern learning is done, the brain systemizes the behavior in such a situation, so I think that I will be able to live in Lak.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether I'm "mote" or not.
That's why living is easy.
I taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you're stuck with the old pattern of "a university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will survive.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I talked about that in my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally around him.
It's not that easy.
It is painful to ask around me.
Mr. Takeshi was working at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a proven track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are being bound by "thinkness," you cannot be light.
As far as I have heard from various women, regardless of position or age, it seems that "cute" is a felony and salvation for any man.
It is difficult to wonder what this "cute" is.
what is it?
Nigeria's illegal northwest, doubling the number of refugees to 40,000: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria has doubled to about 40,000 in the past four months due to increased violence.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, a new $35.5 million funding activity will be needed.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Bokoharam, an Islamic extremist organization that has been working on anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Nigeria over the past 10 months in Sokot, Zamfara and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barok said on Friday to the press.
Abducts, tortures, robbers, murders and sexual violence have occurred frequently, and the press said that the raiders have destroyed their homes and worked on theft.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoharam and the West African branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," says Balok.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR stated in a statement that the security situation in Sokot, especially, had deteriorated, and that refugees going to Niger would increase in the coming months.

The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) has started advertising on header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their requests.
The Service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system in which multiple bidders (advertisers) compete in fair bids to prioritize high-priced ads to media operated by media companies.
It has been introduced mainly by major media as a solution that is transparent for media companies and is expected to improve profitability.
In the past, SSP has been providing advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in response to requests from advertisers, "We want to deliver to specific advertising frames that have high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," we launched LFP in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase advertising frames that meet the needs of advertisers.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP header binding allows them to participate directly in bidding for header binding target ad frames, and it is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, because the target media companies are limited, the advertisement frame of each product and destination according to the brand image is secured, preventing damage to brand value.
One of the advantages for media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each bidder company, called the "Lapper Solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, will enable efforts to meet the expectations of the introduction of media companies.

Yamagata University announced on July 27 that a male assistant professor in his 30s at Yonezawa Campus (Yonezawa City) was suspended for two months.
The punishment was the same date.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, male Assistant Professors had a strong mental stress from around October 2017 when they were teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory.

Cabinet Revolts Reduce the demands of EU withdrawal and demand Boris Johnson to compromise with the EU The Sun
Just three weeks after the EU summit meeting, the Prime Minister's concern is growing around the Prime Minister that it might be too late to bring out significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system to replace the backstop clauses related to the Irish border have been jammed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will propose a compromise proposal on the ground, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings, and insist that the EU accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One minister said that the Supreme Court's ruling on the closing of Congress on Tuesday was "a warning," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister shall use whatever is available from his steps.
Even if it becomes radical, it does not work, and the Cummings plan clearly fails.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to implement the pre-Prime Minister's proposal, if not yet.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are a number of reasons for this, and everyone is trying to end this.
If we postpone it, Boris will end, and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a harsh speech, said: "The Prime Minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to form an agreement.
Instead, we saw the Prime Minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Whales, and discussing with the people on the streets - as if the election campaign was full-fledged."
The prime minister's press yesterday admitted that the agreement was still a long way ahead, saying, "No one should think of it - if it is to achieve the goal, the road is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which would force a three-month postponement if a non-agreed withdrawal, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that the bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue moving forward despite the bill's passage."
Secretary of the European Union Stephen Berkeley returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by television bosses that he would "not succeed."
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was so nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as a surveyor at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone on the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I will never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my favorite place is here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Davelake, and then began a program named Lorraine.
To celebrate the 35th anniversary, she will broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
"The passion and enthusiasm" and "the curiosity" were the key to survival in the television industry, and the moderator said, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't even think that many of the families of the killed or injured children watched us live broadcast the show from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, one of his mother's five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, said that he personally wanted to see me, so we spoke at her house for hours.
Not taking it all on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and that "we really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the pain and pain of the net that they do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of a presidential post from the late President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to fears that it might be a trap to refute military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, the reason why Chiwenga declined the offer was not because of anxiety, but because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was stripped of his administration in a coup.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirmed that officials were senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who had been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munnagagwa," it is said that intense negotiations were held at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized he was losing power, made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three.
President Spokesman George Charamba, former head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Nepera, and Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Muconoli, were involved in the negotiations, and high officials said.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Chiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to denounce military action by the African Union, seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the president to the former CDF was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was a wasteful act to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there were a few political aims of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If anything destroys the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President, Mugabe, hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and crushed by the commander's claims that the constitutional order was not broken.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the whole situation, would decide whether to position it as a coup, would eventually be called a coup and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had penetrated into the presidential residence, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things: to protect his family and to prove the deprivation of power by the military.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
A strong metaphorical expression was used in the words of an envoy (gono), who told the president's desperate message: "Is Tiri Bemaqwapa Macwapa (we belong to the camouflage group, the military department), and we are not politicians or political competitors."
The Army told the other commanders of the region that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the aim was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coup and successors, Mugabe attempted to bring back Munangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed assistance from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but since then President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the South African Development Community, the key South Africans in this process had refused to intervene, but, as repeatedly threatened, clarified that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military had invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources tell the Independent.
The second atomic bomb at the United Nations appeals to ban nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th at the UN Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world free of nuclear weapons was held, and Michiko Takeuchi (63), the granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, delivered a speech and appealed to the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
Five new countries have ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and 32 countries and regions have ratified it.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech and expressed strong concern over recent years that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

China needs strong leadership, otherwise collapse - policy documents
Before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to leadership.
China is vast and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will lead to division and collapse, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the repression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989.
President Xi Jinping, who is the leading figure in the commemoration ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since late 2012.
Xi also oversaw the modernization program of the military that threatened the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its development models, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but merely seek peace rather than supremacy.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the powerful, and war and confusion left a deep scar with that pain; China would never take the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult problems such as the economic downturn and the anti-government movement in Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "disband" its nuclear interests, nor allow its security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"The threat of trade wars and the rising tariffs do not lead to any problem-solving," the White Paper states in relation to trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with the momentum of complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China has the power to face difficulties, change crisis into opportunities, and open a new world.
China has no idea of countering the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., so the U.S. should take the development of China calmly.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka dismissed Director Hirata and Director Kaneko. (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as the director and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local newspaper had a rumor about the baseball team.
After hearing the situation from the two students, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the interviews with 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they generally accepted the facts and dismissed them on 28th.
In the summer of 2015, Motochika WATANABE (74), who raised pitchers such as Daisuke MATSUSAKA (now Nakanichi), left Yokohama.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
In the summer of 2016, he played for three consecutive years in Koshien, and this spring he also participated in Senbatsu.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in the autumn, and his participation in Senbatsu in the next spring was hopeless.
The Spice Girls' Mel C, a diet disorder disease, banned dieting at home.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom admitted that diets were banned at home from their own eating disorders that over the years did not eat anything except fruit and vegetables.
Sporty spices have long been "excessive exercise" without eating well under the pressure of a member of the global pop group, and have subsequently been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by his daughter Scarlett's child rearing, stating that "all topics related to diet in the family are prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his appearance," Mel says.
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was able to be very careful when talking to my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when she gained fame as a member of the Spice Girls, still in front of SNS, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that "heavy" comments about herself in the press led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, became more and more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin," Mel said.
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Judiciary judgment on same-sex marriage
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch decided to accept the case in which 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage could be established even between same sex.
More than 20 countries recognize same-sex marriage, and even within Japan, municipalities such as Sapporo City have a system to certify same-sex partnerships.
The court ruled that the two women were actually married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to grant legal protection to same-sex couples.
The same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Registration Law, and a lawsuit seeking damages to the country as unconstitutional is carried out in five districts such as Sapporo.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system that recognizes diverse families.
Women lived together for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the U.S., but the plaintiffs filed for damages to their former partners after being found guilty.
The court ruled that "the reality of factual marriage between men and women is no different" from the fact that the two lived together.
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of actual marriages with the same-sex rights, such as social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution which defines marriage as "only based on the agreement of both sexes."
Both sexes are "unpredictably same-sex marriage at the time of establishment, so it is not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
While the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, since same-sex marriage was not permitted, the problem remained that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection differ from the genders."
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while recognizing the same situation as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, about 70 percent of people believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a spouse who admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in the tax system and the lack of joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only the same-sex marriage but also the expansion of legal rights for actual marriage.
to the trial and jury trial of former athletes indicted for rape of multiple women.
A jury trial was held for former Delaware University baseball players who were accused of sexual assault on multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and arguments, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's life luck.
A 21-year-old woman said she had been sexually assaulted after sending Conaway to her home by car.
The two met after three weeks at the meeting site Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women were inconsistent and misrepresented, and that women regretted having physical relations.

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, obviously in video
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $2109 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, Circler Keys, Luna Park and some famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions can be said to be one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with suckers, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes lost by someone, and even animal corpses - all flowing rainwater into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor that clogs waterways.
In a video released on September 27 of the World Tourism Day by chance, Dr. Catherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most modified and contaminated estuaries of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour is expected to flow into the waterway, most of which flow through the rainwater drain into Sydney Harbour.
"The heavy rains were falling several times, but Sydney Harbour was... quite tragic," Dr. Daffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastics that flow into the ocean are deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what's there," said Richard Nichols, owner, Dave Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste each year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what's under the water), I think everyone will be really surprised.
Although overwhelming, more than half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The remaining half is plastic at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing right under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce plastics and waste flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so you have to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it back to its old appearance, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, coincidentally with the release of the video funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of an effort to make Australian citizens aware of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment widely.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between 12 and 18 years old have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also stated that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed were increasingly concerned about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.

The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which began dismantling in October, was Futatako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it will begin dismantling the chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) located in Futatako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
Disassembly was used to drain gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
A single chimney is split from the top by a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine buildings and boilers have not been demolished.
A man in his 60s who runs a restaurant nearby said, "When I look back from afar and see a chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel like I came back to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Station began operating in 1967, with the first in 89 and second in 2015.
It is located in a corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has a site area of approximately 225,000 square meters.
Because it is near Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three of them, including nine electric cars, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

This time, Maya Takahashi, a free announcer and commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," spoke about his master.
my mentor's advice to save my rotten self.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is beyond his father and is like a master.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I am different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do it, and what is important as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was struck by the saying that it was "cone" or "busaik," my father said, "I thought it was "cone, but it wasn't."
Then, around the second or third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty woman can do it," and even when I didn't get motivated because I didn't want to do the job I wanted to do, even when my heart was rotten, "Anyone can do the work hard, I asked Mama to do it," but I was glad to be in charge of it.
i learned naturally from my father's acting.
There may be many people who have never seen me read the news, but in fact, since I joined the TV station, I have been exposed to the news all the time with narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when I read the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko deluxe was happy and confident that he was "good at reading Mama news."
When I read the news, I feel important and sensed is "between."
It has been cultivated through watching father's stage, film, television and period dramas in his childhood.
In other words, I think that my father's work on variety shows and how to deal with them is also thanks to my childhood experiences.

At the workshop, members of the OB Group, Department of Ryukyu Performing Arts, Prefectural University of Arts, introduced the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing three lines, koto, drums, kokyu, and flutes.
The host was Mr. Kawamitsu, a member of the OB Association from Miyakojima City, and introduced the charm of kumidori.
In this workshop, I learned how five types of musical instruments are represented in dance by taking up "music" among the three components of kumidori (music, chant, Ryukyu dance).
As for the three lines, it was explained that it was an element of the movement and emotion of the characters along with the songs, and that Kokyu was pulling up the song and the melody of the three lines while playing.
In the latter half, the students actually touched the instrument and felt the tone, and felt the charm of the instrument.
The purpose of this initiative is to get familiar with Ryukyu classical music through musical instruments, and to get interested in many students about kumidori, which is the first time in Miyako.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round was held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18 cards.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will revive in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which the International Automobile Federation (FIA) manages, alongside Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
It has been held every year since 1973 and has become the world's highest rally championship, boasting history and tradition.The competition is said to be the toughest car championship because it runs not only on closed roads (paved roads), but also on various roads such as gravel roads and snow roads at high speeds.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999 and became a big topic.
This time, the Japan Round Preparation Committee was established to host the event in Japan.
As a result, the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation, decided to hold the 2020 WRC Japan Round.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation), the two governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Mr. Hideaki Omura, Governor of Aichi Prefecture
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and as the center of motorsports representing Japan, we will work hard to achieve the success of the FIA World Rally Championship in autumn 2020.
Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japan round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.It is the first global motor sports tournament for this prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all."
Mr. Shoo Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motor Sport, commented on the Japanese round.
The Japan round of the WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City and Shitara Town) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ena City).
The main venue is the "Love Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
The Japan Round Preparatory Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 test event will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is tasmaniadeville the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmaniadeville may be the key to cancer treatment - researchers are opening a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient care.
Medical researchers have found out how some cancer cells camouflage.
The researchers found that the same process occurred in Tasmania Devil and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will create new ways to treat cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmania Devil and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy could significantly alter their treatments for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing fatal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils, which are on the verge of extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camfurage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
Peter McCallum researcher Mark Dawson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Traditional treatments may be reused to revitalize markers, or proteins known as MHCs, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"There is a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils, where cancer cells escape detection as well.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process occurs in humans and Tasmanian devil cancer," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, they may help control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-shaped planets orbit around small stars called red dwarfs, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting its main star, Red dwarf, was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
But in this case, the size of stars and planets is not much different, researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12 percent the size of the Sun, but the planet orbiting around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, led this research published in the journal Science.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets like Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, such as Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, it is almost the same size as the giant planet and only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is quite low as about 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380° / 3527° C).
That's why it's red."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet could have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining its elliptical orbit.
Planets are generated from the same disk, composed of interstellar gas and dust, which created their own orbiting stars.
In the most powerful planetary formation model called the "core accumulation" model, the object is formed from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes the atmosphere by pulling the egg from the planet.
A conflict model called a self-gravity instability model may explain this unusual planetary system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might have been slightly larger than it was thought and the temperature was lower," Morales said.
In this state, the disk becomes unstable, so some dense regions may emerge.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a stimulant bean dip, was eaten by colleagues and charged.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is accused of having his coworkers eat a dip with a stimulant.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of the transfer of methane fetamine, a Class B felony, and of taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit obtained from OregonLive.com, a suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "After eating some mouths, I thought it tasted strange, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returns to work, her stomach gets sick and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, the local hospital where the woman went was judged to have had methane fetamine in the bean dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández "was told the victim's food that he had put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane fetamine in the bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Derri shows Medina Hernández turning his camera back and clinginging behind a microwave but taking something out of the brager.
After that, he stood up and wiped his nose, walked toward the table and put a bean dip in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been contaminated at the moment.
Medina Hernández was detained in Marion County prison instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gunn, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of felony by assault, robbery, supplication, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "The Challenge Can be organized" President of JR Tokai, attach importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on 27th, Shin Kaneko, President of JR Tokai, reiterated the importance of early construction, stating that "it is better to separate the issues discussed with Shizuoka Prefecture that should not be organized before starting construction and that it should be done after starting construction."
More specifically, he said, "We will talk at the meeting place and at the front stage."
Mr. Kaneko said, "When we organize all the problems, it is difficult to start construction, and I think it is possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea, and we must talk to the prefecture."
The prefecture is concerned that the spring water that came out during the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that "If there is something that can be realistic, but I think it is difficult to think from the safety side of construction."
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the route change mentioned was "not possible."
The impact on the opening period was the three locations of Minami Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station and Nagoya Station, which were particularly time-consuming for construction.

Trump Hotel owner complains about the suitability, but also holds liquor sales license.
Washington (AP) - The Board of Alcohol and Beverage Controls in Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel due to questioning the suitability of the owner.
On Wednesday, three members, two former judges and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, based on the state law that the applicant's "appropriateness" is required to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages, this is the second time the hotel has filed an appeal to cancel the right to provide alcohol.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year claimed President Trump's assault and repeated fraud and violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the license was already approved.
This was the second time a petition was issued to update the permit.
The honey collected from the bees "Fly Bees" raised by Bentley is the first harvest!
How do you taste honey collected from Flying Bees raised at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September 2019.
More than 100 bottles of honey were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the site of a factory that assembles cars?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honeys produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we set up a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant earlier this year.
The beekeepers have been watching the bees from wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains gathering honey from various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been engaged in a wide range of activities through its Crew Plant and our business to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of bentra honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to fulfill our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million honey bees, Flying Bees, were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator, filtered the fallen honey, and then bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley's attention.
The label was designed by Louise McCallum, the designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we would like to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey such as scones.
The Cleveland Police, a series of scandals, the worst of the UK in a violent report.
A police officer who followed the scandal was labeled the worst in the UK by the inspector.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
According to the Cleveland Police, "heavy deterioration" continues.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley, Director of the Police Department, said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Mike Wiel, Chief of Police, resigned in January less than a year before his appointment, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal activities.
Captain Simon Herwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee for Illegal Practices because of his colleague's involvement in sexual activity.
He resigned from the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Home Affairs intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I have full responsibility for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal," and impeachment has to be settled.
Nobody knows what will happen next.
Currently, we believe that we are involved in the cover-up, and it may take some time to investigate," Pelosi told CNN in Congress.
"We're going to do a job that we're starting to do based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Vladimir Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to the call records, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Giulani.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was the national security attorney of the Ministry of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before the formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of political fund violations.
In response to Barr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee decided to ask who to testify.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, touching Trump's name on the telephone talks with the Ukrainian president in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision regarding the disposition of this accusation.
Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower, as Trump attacked the whistleblower on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spies was different in the past.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said a terrible thing about the person who might have provided information to whistleblowers is that it significantly undermines the integrity of the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political interests, and noted a historic step.
The call content is contained in the accusations published on Thursday, in which the whistleblower claims that Trump abused his office in the next 2020 presidential election to "see intervention" in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-grade computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Bentek, driving ban by speed violation
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.
The 28-year-old forward at Crystal Palace confirmed on January 20, that he had driven his Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 speed limit in Richmond, southwest London.
In March, the Belgians then shot a speed violation camera at Patney, south-west London, driving 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek was convicted of the two violations under a single trial procedure in which one justice of the peace tried and sentenced to light crimes.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu is concerned about the composition of the jury.
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the review committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) elections.
He questioned the inclusion of Frank Davids, who expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu said that the chairman was interested in the results of the review process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside of the previous interest, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kwak Palmer about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that his commission should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club, but when Mr. Palmer attended the committee, he suggested that he had prejudice and injustice.
The members of the committee were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4 after taking office at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer, Chairman of the Board.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Appocavi, sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage to be 1,000 yen.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and only 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded that they "approved" to raise the yen to 1,000 yen per hour, including information related (100 percent), construction (70,6%), and wholesale (61,7%).
The majority of manufacturers (51 and 9 percent) and service industries (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink, and accommodation (60 and 9 percent) were the opposite.
The representative of the meeting said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high proportion of opposition in industries with high part-time and hourly wages."
The average amount paid by companies who answered "the opposite" was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, there were 61.3% of regular employees, 54.5% mid-term employment, and 15.4% non-regular employees.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (new graduation 13.3%, middle school 37.5%) and construction industry (new graduation 24.1%, middle school 38.1%) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% had challenges in hiring, and in many cases the number of applicants was low, the low profile of the company was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (2 years after graduation).
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied, "It is already approved."
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total showed acceptance.
64.4% of companies were "not admitted" and high in construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%) and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the Australians.
Justin Tipplick said that Wales will be hosting the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Wallabeads, it will be the hottest winner in Pool D, and perhaps the quarterfinal against France or Argentina will be sure.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory was the 14th win against Wales, Tiplic and the team would be a straight line between England and England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to try and win at the top of the group and end," said Tiprick, a Welshman.
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last fall.
I think Australia will be quite blaming to return the debt, but I will do my best to win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I'm here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Wales has won only 32 years ago.
And under the supervision of Warren Gutland, the total score for the 3 Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight Team was only 7 out of 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was included in several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
Certainly the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it was impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
In order to win Wales, a breakdown battle with the Australian duo Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Law, is key.
Up until now, Tiplic has played 67 international matches, and has played several games and both players in the past.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When I play against the background of the World Glass, I always know that I will be in a tough game from now on.
They are always the best in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs.
I want to improve myself by fighting the world's best players rather than confronting the very strong Bucklow.
I want to fight with the best opponents, and if I play against them, I have to keep up with myself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it is an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you will be able to play a game that won't lose.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from an entertainer?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by the dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said at a press conference on July 22 that "the company has no talent at 9 and there is no talent at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the "9:1" ratio, it would be considered that there was a gift from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and investors' views that taxes would be paid were also tweeted on Twitter.
If Gyara's share is "9:1," does it cost a gift tax?
i heard from you.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer your question from the tax standpoint.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen is "9:1," the profit of 1 million yen in sales and 10 million yen in expenses will be 9 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, we should have tax returns like this and already pay corporate taxes.
Also, even if you are wondering about the allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount I received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the entertainer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price far from the original market for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as in this case, a third party will not be able to decide on how much tax-appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen's payment statement is a pity.

the white house, the impeachment foothold, panic.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, explaining that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be increasing "awareness, anxiety, and concern" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't think it's true.
The White House official joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, or that the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied, so there was no confidence in how to proceed, as this claim was so serious.
Another person familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's uncontrollable response would increase the likelihood of "injuring" if the impeachment was prolonged.
Another source of information tells us that during impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised every day, and that there are also close advisers who expect the president to act "impulsive."
Trump is increasingly alarming about unpredictable actions and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and is concerned about the president and politics in the electoral year.
Trump faced the greatest threat he had ever faced during his term of office, and reviving his strategy that he considered effective during the Russian investigation by Robert Moller, he changed his hands and became an attacker or defense.
Trump attempted to disappoint the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempting to discredit whistleblowers as motivated by factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the Mora test, but this time they are beginning to feel the difference.
The president, whose power is branded, seemed to be coming at a press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have a heart to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that damage can be mitigated, claiming that it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information on the calls between President Trump and Vladimir Zellensky, who are controversial, and the Ukrainian president.
Furthermore, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic family close to the White House points out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and the effect of impeachment on the acquisition of new supporters is unlikely.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President for the last four months."
Another source stated that those claiming impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how uncertain the president's response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained this plan, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented and what kind of actions will be implemented.
However, this person said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations activities aggressively in order to counter organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, and to counter the momentum that the publication and publication of critical internal accusations had given the Democratic impeachment.
More information on this situation clearly shows the lack of long-term strategic perspectives, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin, stating that he would not publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later.
The current pressure is expected to increase from the time of the investigation by Robert Moller, who spoke only through almost silent prosecutions.According to the person involved in the case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitbull of Trump and Corrie Luwandouski, who served as the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never met the president or his close associates about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Cellow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in impeachment by Clinton and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left Pat Cipolon, now White House's legal advisor, lacking such experience and currently lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy is generally aware that officials are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but that they need people who are organized and can lead all the collective efforts and political struggles.

Long-distance love needs to be prepared Only 16% success rate Tomoyoshi Morikawa - Yahoo! News
9/6 (Fri) 13:51 delivery
I was able to have a boyfriend because of his work, but for long distance love ...
"I'm going to marry someday," but I can't see the goal and I can't see it.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation with our allies to marriage?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice, which was derived from detailed data analysis, must be read.
what's this?
I am worried about whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during long distance love.
I want to continue living in Kansai where my workplace and my family are, but his place of work is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from long distance love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (hereinafter, -) C is in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested in distance and the two become stronger," but in the first place is long distance love going well?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) A survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous for distance love, but according to the data, only 16% of couples reached from distance love to marriage.
Since love is done with five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the partner (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touch), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice on the phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to the other person's house, you will be burdened with time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even though it is a holiday to heal the tiredness of the work, the body is cum.
I feel happy when I return home.
Isn't that the only way to break up after a long distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently or a couple that has a long time to leave.
I'll be engaged a year later, or I'll come back from work two years later.
It may be difficult if you do not see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of demanding Trump's nude pictures.
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump will be investigated.
Thursday, in a comment to defend the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain presidential nude photos.
Senator Nunes, the Republican executive of the House Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had requested to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos," he said.
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes, Huffpost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democratic Party was trying to find the truth.
The only response to this was to Congressman Jim Heims of the Connecticut Democratic Party, but many other members question whether the answer was a red-naked truth.
Memediate.com speculates that Nunes' nudist comments may be related to the "more confusing and unidentified details" that were written in the controversial steel document.
It is a notorious report that former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape" in one room of a hotel in Moscow, where Trump is said to be watching prostitutes urinate, suggesting existence.
Origami, wallet and real cards.
Money transfer, loan, insurance, investment - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to pay by Origami Pay, transfer money, and withdraw money through collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, we will start financial services such as loans, investments and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the challenges of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates," adding that "We want to provide services that are equally useful to people who have been marginalized from finance and those who have not been able to benefit from the system until now."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origami ID, you will be able to seamlessly complete from application to transaction and get timely information.
He also explained that by deploying the Origami app not only on the Origami app but also on partner companies' apps, it will be available even if you don't have the Origami app.
In terms of financing, the Bank introduced a function that allows for post-payment in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were suddenly needed, it was completed on the Origami app from application to repayment.
As for insurance, as a partner company, he introduced Aioi Nissei Insurance and First Life Insurance.
The two companies will use the data and knowledge of both companies to develop insurance products in line with life events.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually after registration to the necessary administrative authorities.
New businesses for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support the effective use of data, including data held by the company, in addition to digitizing customer contacts by its Pay through the payment function provided by Origami.
Origami recognizes that effective utilization of data, such as the acquisition of structured data such as sales and unstructured data in the real society, and the accumulation, processing, and analysis of such data, will become a challenge in partner companies that partner with Origami.
Among them, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with payment data by its Pay and structured data owned by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the promotion of effective data utilization and the creation and transformation of new business models utilizing digital technologies and data.
Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies gather various data and make customer contacts," and explained, "In the next phase, it is important to develop business models using data."
"We want to create innovation in the next phase by combining data built on the Origami Network and data from many companies."
Details of specific services will be announced sequentially.
In addition, the Origami Conference 2019 will provide the convenience of Origami's future efforts, such as delivering coupons to smartphones when it rains.
In addition, Origami Pay now provides full compensation for illegal use, but it is clearly defined as a system under terms of use.
He also stated that he will work as a supporter in cooperation with the Tourism Association and other organizations to revitalize the region.
On September 7, a ceremony was held in Aweena Osaka, Osaka City to commemorate the singer Mitoko Ogasawara, who died at the age of 100 this July.
the people involved showed the representative songs of Ogasawara
Approximately 140 people from Japan participated, including the chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, Mr. Masaaki Hunaga, and other compatriots.
At the ceremony, Mr. Yukie IKEBE, the chairman of the ceremony, gave a speech.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I can't believe that the teacher died yet."While preparing for "Remembrance Meeting," Mr. Mitsuko Ogasawara felt that he was a great and great person, and regretted his death.
Then he said, "If we can do activities that can expand the meeting even a little," he said.
After the dedication, the Messe-ji, which was sent by Mr. Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the Korea Association for Arts and Exchange and the International Institute for Chuchu Thought, was introduced.
Regenerative biofuel research can reduce emissions
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only airplane to fly in the air and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuels.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as fat and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fats to be used for production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude oil-based fuels, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The achievement of this technology in the first generation is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is something like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low-risk approach, which requires different treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Regarding the second option, Dr. Bresler said, "You can try it in the reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the US Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Currently, Foge operates a testing plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build 25 million US dollars of production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher in terms of fuel transport and production.
"As a technologist," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple choices can be made in parallel with the decisions given.

Boris Johnson's camp warned that Britain would face riots like Los Angeles if Brexit was overturned.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
The high officials of the Prime Minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson said he needed to "quench anger" against the political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but insisted that he would not use the term "defeat."
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain calm, one minister said to The Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gilles Joan or the Los Angeles riots of 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and then there are a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to innocent.
This year, French anti-government protesters wearing eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House, stating that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters oppose the withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people will not give up writing letters to Congress.
It takes less time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing the House of Representatives rebellion, which calls for lower demands on EU withdrawal and instead for a compromise to hit the EU.

pakistan, brother of social media celebrity, life imprisonment for honor murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the case fades.
"It takes too long to forget people," said Farzana Bali, a female rights activist and founder of the first gender department at a university in Pakistan.
Human rights groups say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honored murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the number of real honor killings is much higher than that, because it is estimated that Pakistan accounts for about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings that are organized by honor-based violence surveillance organizations worldwide every year.

Floods and disruptions caused by prolonged monsoons in many parts of India
India's monsoon season lasts for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall, building collapses and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces in early September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37% higher than usual.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues for a few days, the monsoon will weaken at the latest decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, the buildings collapsed due to heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays, killing several people and causing disaster.
The houses were flooded, and the inhabitants crossed the street with water to their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Raknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
Long-lasting monsoons are not desirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Meherer, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables will rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is on October 8 in Dashela, where the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, the evil smiling figure of the beard-boo appearing in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if the Monsoon pulls long, the last laugh may be Lavana.
[Sendai] Defeat Yokohama M with a Compact Defense Director Watanabe (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
J1 Begalta Sendai held a private practice for four days from 24 to 4 consecutive days (open to the press only 20 minutes at the beginning) for the 28th Battle of Yokohama M (at 7 p.m.
Yokohama M lost 15 points in the last three league games, but coach Shin Watanabe (45) responded by saying, "The players showed me a powerful, battle-like exercise."
Last season, he lost eight games in the clubworths at home on July 18 and lost five in the enemy territory.
This season is also a difficult enemy to defeat in 1-2.
Yokohama M, who is currently ranked 14th, has 48 points in the league.
In addition to the 13-point FW Marcos Juniol (26), 10-point 7-assisted FW Nakakawa Teruto (27) and other strong frontline players, J's leading CB duo from Japan's DF Hatakenaka Makinosuke (24) and Shunto's Brazilian DF Chiago Multins (24).

exposure to a large amount of pesticides could increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
Current studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to the male groups that did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this study is the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides at work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure at work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of the Department of Elderly Care at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
The study focuses only on Japanese American men, and researchers say that it may not be applied to women or other races.
Due to the long half-life of pesticides, health effects may appear years after exposure.
The study showed the greatest impact within 10 years after exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and heart attack at work is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably due to the increased importance of other factors related to aging and the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low- and medium-density pesticides was not important to heart disease and heart attack.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone meeting
The impeachment process against US President Donald Trump was a radical week in Washington's political affairs.
For political novice Vladimir Zellensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump phone problem so far, and will have a wide impact on Zelensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on concrete proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's 100 percent argument is controversial.
Zelensky added that President Macron and Merkel both did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, debated on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the EU's support including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the "Russian invasion."
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytica said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scolded military aid and asked Selensky to investigate two rather than one, one against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the other on the server of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to say bad about anyone.
"We thank the people who helped us with the announcement of the call," Zerensky said at the New York General Assembly.
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The award was awarded for Ghana's interim implementation rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification research activities (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the UN's Global Safety and supervisory audit report.
The safety award is a result of the recognition that Ghana complies with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO for safety at airports and in its own airspace.
These awards were created as part of ICAO's delayed National Zero Campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for security evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was given to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada Nii Icoi Otou, and Director of Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, President Olmiwa Bennard Aliou emphasized the need to maintain aviation safety in the participating countries.
"It is important to keep in mind that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada said that this award complements the sector's indomitable efforts and perseverance, and is the gift of Ghana's efforts.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump appoints Peter Gino as FEMA Chief: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Senate Committee held at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
FEMA's deputy director, Gino, was in the position of deputy director to oversee government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been vacant since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Department of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, decided that Mr. Long had illegally used government vehicles to commute to work between Washington and his home, Norcarorina.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, raised suspicions of drunkenness and involvement in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of this month after consideration.
Mr. Gino's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Bureau in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying activity in San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant on suspicion of selling illegal marijuana pens, care began at 4:37 p.m., and a large container of butanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found at an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found the equipment to pack the beep cartridge.
"This process is very dangerous," said Cano.
He said that he had previously been involved in the drug investigation and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used for the beep product.
"The static electricity from clothes alone can ignite, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," says Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away as well as a fire one after another.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigator said that he received some anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activity.
The investigators are still in pursuit of who is the black curtain of illegal Beip activities.
The police said that Zhang himself believed that the office had a store in the office because the office was empty.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to prevent illegal babyping products from appearing again.
Captain Kano said, "It's a substitute that you don't know whether it's real or not."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a huge impact on our community and children, so the police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a big earthquake of 6 strong seismic intensity!
Evacuation training at Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
A practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held annually.
On the stage, there is actually a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department, and it is assumed that a 6-strong earthquake will occur along the way of the song.
About 300 people including kindergarten children, local residents and hall staff participated in the training on the 27th.
when the children enjoy playing...
(Interviewed in Hall)
"It's an earthquake, it's an earthquake, it's an earthquake.
After that, the participants were evacuated to the entrance in anticipation of a fire.
Earthquakes that do not know where to occur.
The participants renewed their awareness of disaster prevention through training.
Exhibition at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver foil yarn, and the gorgeous embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Herre Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, determined that it was one point.
This faded piece of cloth, hung on the wall of a small church in one rural area, is said to have been placed there 100 years ago and is thought to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally found this gorgeous cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly the room that the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
The only remaining part of the 16th-century dress is that it was an important discovery of the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of her sleeves, three years of research has led to the growing conviction of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The elaborately expensive textile "Gin yarn cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but the embroidery of plants and flowers of "name" quality also suggests that the patterns of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later were noble persons.
The dress was probably the equivalent of a Tudor mansion at the time of its creation.
Furthermore, in the late Elizabethan 1590s, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace or that she could not endure rivalries wearing such luxury clothing.
Mr. Lin said that it is important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
I was always very happy to see the cloth and say, "It's amazing."
A long second life of one piece of dress used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton, cut off and blind, seems unexpected but not so.
Bactton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley before Elizabeth died in 1603.
Over 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on very delicate hand-sewing altarpieces, will be displayed next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and led by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you're really impressed by the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the front and back, you will find a great respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's Lost Dress Exhibition is held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched" A week after missing girls, the Self-Defense Force withdraws Volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for Kokura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 days to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces launched a total of 650 people centered on dangerous areas such as mountain slopes and sawmills.
Also, on the 27th, the whereabouts of 20-year-old men who volunteered to participate in the search were lost, and the search was not found.
The police and fire department will continue to search from 6:30 am on the 29th.
1st Oral Bench - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the Plaintiff appealed for election invalidation, as compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member was the lowest in Japan in July this year, with only 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture.
In the first oral speech held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendant's side called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It should not be said that the issue of constitutionality was in a significant inequality, but should be constitutional."
The judgment will be passed on October 30.

An unmanned supply machine arrives at the space station Catch with a robotic arm | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
Konotori No. 8, an unmanned supply vehicle that arrived at the International Space Station.
The robot arm of the station is growing from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on July 28.
On the night of the 28th, the unmanned spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), which is about 400 kilometers altitude, arrived near the station.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the speed difference and approaches to a distance of about 10 meters.
The robot arm of 17 and 6 meters in length is the flow that grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching it to the station, the flight attendants carry the luggage.
Mexican drug cartels, one third of the drug in the United States
Shortly after the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
Nearly 800 people died of overdose in Chicago last year.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named El Mencio Cervantes.
Matthew Donahew DEA, executive officer in Mexico, said, "Mencho is DEA and, in fact, the top priority of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in El Mencho were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartels, Harrisco Nueva Henellación (CJNG), are involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel has sold "massive" cocaine, methane phenyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and sent back to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho does not punish and defends his empire.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing when handling it.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped by the smuggler.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of toxic substances that effectively take the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Tennoji Zoo (Tennoji Ward, Osaka City) held a farewell party for the only male koala "ARK" in Osaka Prefecture.
In mid-October, it was decided to rent a zoo in the UK for 10 years, and it is likely not to return.
thank you. cheer up.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of Koala, where eucalyptus grew, spared their part.
He is 12 years old.
Coala's life expectancy is 15 to 20 years, and it is expected that he will complete Tenju in the UK, where he is married.
Mr. Hideki Tsujimoto (40), the keeper in charge, cried out, "It's hard to put the curtain down on the rearing of the koala.
Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the old days.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition The Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, a sequel to the Last of Ass.
Some of the tense video games of this new action game were also shown by fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 news.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to old times in many ways.
The last-of-as-part 2 has been released on multiple discs since the PSwan era.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"The story is magnificent and complicated in a different way than the previous one," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell stories with so many characters.
I didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but it eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but it was actually the beginning and realized that all the other sections started."
The game was so spectacular that it didn't enter a single Blu-ray that it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
There is no need to ruin this surprise, but Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic Notic Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
MLB The Show 19 will also be released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like the Last of As Remastered and want to pre-order the sequel, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replica, a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notojima Travel Sales "Save" Council Trial Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, the Notoshima Regional Development Council (Notoshima Regional Development Council) started to sell the products.
During the trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings and foods crossed the Somachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
There were also products that were sold more than expected and quickly replenished, and residents asked for continued "help" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiragobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
In the town of Suso, the population was formed and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't think it would sell so much."
Ms. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
The user also ordered "I don't want canned coffee, but I want my own drip coffee."
The council will consider what was requested.
At present, Notoshima has only one convenience store where people can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to help "shopping weak."
Until December, the 20 town councils in the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to add $100 million to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been significantly revised to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-affected resident support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to $100 million of drought relief funds for infrastructure development and countermeasures against drought.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted more than $7 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskel: Murder of a former wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of his five children.
Haskell said on July 9, 2014, he was pushed into the residence of Stay and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department said Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old son, 9 and 7 years old daughter died.
Only one of his family, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but then recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed until Monday's trial.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of the girl who shook her anger resonated with the leaders of each country.
Global warming is becoming more serious.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and irritability protested all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people from over 150 countries participated.
He also set up a message board and marched in Morioka.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will be launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to 1-5 degrees.
All participating countries will take measures that are defined by each country without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is pointed out to be related to global warming.
In order to achieve global warming at a fast pace, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit held by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations, which strengthened the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated new targets, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become noticeable.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy has set zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of this century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years" is large.
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who demonstrated Japan's efforts at an environmental meeting, said at a meeting on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy things."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wound, which is not an argument, is nothing more than the "replacement of the issue" that the person himself refutes.
The international community has to deal with the common crisis of humanity.
There is no sufficient effectiveness in the efforts of each country.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
In order to avoid taking the future, adults should act.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The U.S. Army's research results have led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such an Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and timekeeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Distributed Quantum Information Center of the Army Research Institute of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation generated between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and measured in one, even if the other quantum bits are physically far away, the measurement results in the other are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is twice as large as the past, and it is also a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
Intercity quantum networks can be said to consist of networks between physical quantum bitpoints in entangled states despite their large distances.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum internet.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing large-scale distributed enthanglement," says Sarah Gamble, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at exits through fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions and excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed into optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
In his team, he first sent the light particles through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to the optimal value of long distance transfer - 1550 nm, which is the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
The measurement results showed that atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured simultaneously with high-quality "clock" quantum bits, which leads to the realization of entangled networks in long-distance atomic clocks.
The large entangled clock network is a very important field for the Army from the viewpoint of accurate positioning, navigation and time-keeping applications," said Dr. Frederick Fatemi, an Army researcher who co-operated the program.
