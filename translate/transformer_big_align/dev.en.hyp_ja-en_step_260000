Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina to protest the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators in the town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon plans to store the site of the barracks in Turgovska Gola, and vow to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take away a healthy future," and "Don't stop it."
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grad, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities next week.
On Friday, Croatian national broadcasters reported that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or to pay for the amount of waste in Croatia that Slovenia would be treated at newly constructed facilities.
Tomislav Chorich, Minister of Environment and Energy of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia is also suffering from public waste disposal from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location on its own near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would Bosnian pants pocket, or Turkovska gola, be the best place in Croatia?"

PayPay salesman "I'm on the Wave" "I'm on the Wave" Cashless to happen "I'm on the Wave" I wonder if the waves will swell (Tokai TV) - Yahoo!
Tax increase starting in October.
In line with this, the country will start the cashless point reduction project.
In order to reduce the coldness of consumption, a maximum of 5% is reduced.
[Image] Just before the tax increase ... shops and businesses "cacheless introduction"
So what's happening now is "introduction."
This is a cashless store that was previously a cash business.
We adhered to the installation site.
■ Start-up introduction just before the tax increase ... "Cashless" shops and businesses rush.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular restaurant operated by Takeshin confectionery, and there are more than 100 kinds of Okakiya-arashi in the store.
Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users, visited Tatsushin on this day.
PayPay Yasuda: Is there any payment method other than cash?
Mr. Shinmi, President of Takeyoshi Co., Ltd.: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it's easier than cash if I get used to it because it's no longer possible to receive a tsurisen.
To date, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce the usage by 20%.
Although the number of users has increased dramatically, Yasuda is an "employee man" who sells the introduction of PayPay to customers.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also listened to Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's a peak now.If you can't talk to me before you jump in, or if you can do a consumer reduction business together, I'm going to ask you about it with PayPay, so I'm getting a member of the store registration, and now I'm riding a wave."
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the country's consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves in the country's Consumer Reduction Project.
With the consumption tax increase from October, the government introduced a system to reduce the maximum amount of shopping to 5% to consumers to prevent the cooling of consumption.
As in "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before tax increases.

What is Münchhausen syndrome that appeared in Netflix's The Politicians?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are ill.
The Politician is broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, the president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinness Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents act as if they were physically or mentally ill, even though the person under the protection is not seriously ill.
There are many different types of pathologies, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is hypothesized to be himself ill.
However, the surrogate Münchhausen syndrome implies that others who are clearly under their protection are ill.
This is also known as FII, a type of child abuse.
It is a rare symptom, but usually parents exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if a child is sick.
So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following caution.
Children are healthy, but if they are ill, they try to persuade medical professionals.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make children feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing that they are diabetes.
Overdose medications and other drugs cause symptoms of disease.
How general is Muhnhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.
what should we do if we suspect the damage to our children?

Nigeria: Police raided schools in Kaduna and rescued 300 children.
The Kaduna Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
Police said the children were inhumane, but the school denied this claim.
The school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
Parents come to deliver meals to their children every day, so they know what kind of environment they are.
I was very surprised to have closed the school after the police came here, evacuated the kids, and all the food the parents delivered left.
There are parents who can testify whether they had children in such a terrible environment as the police say, but this is unfair."
He adds that Abduraman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
It is also said that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhumane environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Central Coast's "extraordinary delinquency" girl rape, court order to confront the victim.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind and dragged her into the bushes while attending a school in Central Coast, Virginia.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to wood and added sexual assault.
Immediately after the arrest, a house search warrant was issued and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges of assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking along the path, and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and a knife coming out of the bushes suddenly.
When the girl asks, "Don't stop, don't do it," the man put a head lock on the girl and forcibly took her to a hybrid forest.
The man told the girl, "Don't speak loud.
He said, "If you don't, you'll have to do it."
The man had a knife on his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused it for nearly an hour.
When a man spilled the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., with several phone calls and phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood on his clothes with mud, grass, and trees, and was involved in street violence, and when he chased the driver to the bushes, he claimed that he had fallen by hand.
The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, warning IT representatives that AI development is based on public interests
On Friday, Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors that the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice if it did not involve ethical evaluation of public interests.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference, where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
In the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and responses by social media companies during the atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines freed workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technology advances cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological progress is hostile to public interests, unfortunately, it will be counterproductive to a kind of savage based on the theory of strong people.
According to the organizers of the conference, they would like to leverage the expertise of the participants in this meeting to find a person who can become a future adviser to the Catholic Church on the high-tech field.
Nagano Appliance Directed by G Abe's debut song!
thank you, master.
Hiroshima and Nagano Kuyoshinote (34) made their debut in the mid-day battle (Mazda) on the 27th with "4th and left."
The first double-death second base hit was "Septmber" by Earth Wind & Fire on the appearance of giant Abe who announced his retirement this season.
The result was a liner, but a sensitive fan who noticed Nagano's stylish surprise was applauded.
For Nagano, Abe became a senior official after becoming a professional.
The Tokyo Dome, where the DeNA tournament was held, was held to commemorate Abe's retirement.
Real Madrid's loaner, Martin Woodegor, and his supporter, Fan Excitement
Martin Woodegor was surprised by Michel Oyalsabar's preemptive support.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, breaking the record in the domestic season and reaching the top of the La Liga rankings.
However, this season, despite not losing one game at La Liga, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who have not entered the current plan.
Vinicius Junior is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Udegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves and was surprised by Michel Oyalusabal's preemptive assist, while Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, was a dribble that pulled the opponent's crotch and sent an exquisite pass through the inside of the other two players to Oyal Sabal, where he scored the goal with this exact slew ball.
With the second goal of Willian José and the third penalty spot of the stunning Oyalusabal, he secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before Alabes' midfielder Manu Garcia left 5 minutes before the end.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
The young Norwegian, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated this territory.
Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When the lawsuit came in contact, the name of Sharad Powerle was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazare was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's executive branch (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Ajit Powerl, former deputy minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit came in contact, Sharad Powerl's name was nowhere.
The executive's lawsuits and suspicions that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud were questioned, and Anna Hazale said Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name came up and who referred it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazare, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The executive will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the joint bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the October 21 elections in Maharashtra.
The former coalition minister clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, declaring that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
NCP called the action by the Executive Bureau a political abbreviation.
South Africa: A 20-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder by a student of UKZN, Cinesenba Ndrob.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office (NPA), a man who was arrested and involved in the murder of a student at the University of Kwazuru Natal (UKZN), Cinesenba Drob, is expected to apply for bail next week.
The suspect was charged with murder at the Musinga Court of Justice on Thursday.
Natasha Carra, spokesman for the Kwazuru Natal prosecutors office, said to the NEWS24 that the lawsuit was postponed on October 2.
He added that the state government is expected to object to the bail of suspects.
According to Colonel Tembeka Mbere, a police spokesman for the Kuwazuru Natal Police, a 20-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday.
The police said in this week that he was stabbed under the left side and abdomen.
Drov is said to have been a customer at the Musinga Drifkana Motorsport event on Saturday evening.
In a statement issued on that day, the organizers of the motor sports event stated in a preliminary report that the customer factor remained after the event's work to watch the music performance.
Unfortunately, one of them was attacked by a stranger on the way, and then died in a hospital.
In response to her death, UKZN suspended academic activities on Friday, stating that "We need to consider the frailty of life as a community and the brutality that often occurs in this society."

i agree to pay 30 million dollars for epipen settlement
The company agreed to pay a settlement of $30 million in the event that it did not disclose information about the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation on the presence of overclaims on epipenes against Medicaid.
On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had classified epipens as generics in the Medicaid drug rebate program.
This showed that payments from pharmaceutical companies to governments were extremely low compared to those classified as "brands."
The company announced in July that it had reached a fundamental agreement with the SEC on this matter.
The statement issued on Friday did not affirm or deny the SEC's claims.
Stepping the accelerator pedal eliminates accidents!
Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by a mistake in driving.
The number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistakes by elderly drivers is increasing.
Especially when it comes to a sudden start, it becomes a panic and the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
There are new vehicles equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such a mistake, but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended vehicles.
A system for prevention and prevention of sudden departures developed and sold by after-part manufacturers.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform you of pedal mistakes from a new perspective.
It is to avoid pedal mistakes with "an alarm."
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
It is called to react to the sound and bring the accelerator back, and to avoid rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the mistake.
It is difficult to understand changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who can hear easily.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excl. tax) and it is easy to set.
[Ashimo Watching-kun] The World Wing started selling in mid-September with the Ashimo Watching-kun, a device to prevent accelerators and brake mistakes.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped in, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the rapid advance.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I did not tell the signal from the accelerator and immediately controlled the sudden start by turning it into a creeping driving state (the state that left the brake in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to be cleaned up.
Installation is possible only with capraon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Ms. Saori Kusumoto (32) of Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked the nursery school suddenly lost their desire to go to the nursery school after a flood, and they were forced to leave at night.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up the house and have not had enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can not panic and say "OK" to children.
Yukari Ogushi (36) of Shiraishi Town spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four family members including three-year-old children.
"If there is a child who can't stay still, he will use his mind around him."
A woman in the center of Saga City (45), with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend my time at home as much as possible in a disaster and have food and simple toilets.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinako Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a child of 6 and 8 years old, proposed that "the elementary school had a closed school e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or mail system.
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "It was okay last time."I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
President Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions presented will be communicated to the government as a group."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Arcuri and the police inspectors.
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandals of the Mayor of London in violation of the Penal Code.
The Greater London Administration (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts of conduct" on suspicion that Mr. Arcuri had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists in the presence of information indicating that a crime could have been committed," says GLA.
This was never proven.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The issue was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations made by police in England and Wales.
This issue was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to that of the Chief of Police at that time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, although he claimed it was "a mistake."
The statement received news from the Sunday Times, but it was reported that U.S. citizens who had moved to London seven years ago had been given preferential treatment to Mr. Johnson, who was paid £126,000 from public money during the mayor's time in London, and joined three foreign trade delegations with Mr. Johnson.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 to the hacker house, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked questions puzzled about the investigation process before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "regular proper assessment" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to a number of reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Ircuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessman was "public secret among the staff."
The GLA's move to entrust the Prime Minister to a police supervisory body touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence on any charges, and prior to the press release issued late Friday night, the prime minister has not given the supervisory authority an opportunity to answer."
Both the public and the mass media will be able to see the political Kyogen that has been organized by amasama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the friendship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Tourism and Regional Promotion Division was "public secret."
L&P's former staff stated that despite some who believed that the company was "untrustworthy" at that time, he had the privilege of attending trade-related meetings abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, about the future.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back on the past 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the 20 years history.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all people involved, not to the history that has only been achieved through the power of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit has remained unchanged for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from anxiety about money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, the operation will not result unless you walk with the beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result was a 20-year long-term long-term fund, and we believe it was because we continued to be a direct sales system that delivered messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
Generally speaking, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why you can trust us.
mc miller's death, the third drug arrester, is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged for drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to the court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had previously accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl before dying, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record released on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Levis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is charged with delivering drugs to Petitt as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in detention, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutor in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the trial began, citing the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate reply to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram, and released a song titled "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with recent opioid drug abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died of drug overdose in 2016 and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games for nine-year-old Nigerian children
The nine-year-old uses a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hide-and-do game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime, and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch a bat from a hiding place.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that "we spend time building games when we're bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children such as Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in numerous mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, his interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was too obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but what if I make a game myself so that others can play it?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, has the name of his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it becomes African innovation, young people like Basil will take the initiative.
Two 12-year-old Nigerians have recently been awarded the award by creating a robot that uses program code to organize household chores.
In May 2019, a female high school team from Ghana, Akrobo, who programmed boxed robots, won the Robofest Contest.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of bribery.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely accused federal agents of corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of a plea deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware of false statements against FBI agents in a 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judiciary documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Hayes deems.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecution sued former Congressman Hayes for involvement in the insurance company's plan to fund the state's insurance director's election.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh, founder of insurance and investment companies, has donated over $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016, and has recently become the state's top political donor.
Lindbergh supported Republican principles and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer called for a comment by email on Friday, but did not respond.
On Friday, Hayes' Defendant, Carns Davis, also called for additional comments via email, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said that he had never spoken to Cosey about the staff of the state insurance bureau.
However, according to a factual document, Hayes was actually talking about a state insurance supervisor and a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecution said Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cosey, and also talked directly with the supervisor.
The indictment, published in April, claims that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to hold up to $2 million in his campaign to re-election in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for replacement of officials who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported suspected attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them stand.
Cozy has no doubts.
The indictment described in a conversation, including Lindbergh and Cosey, that Lindbergh co-owners instructed Hayes to send $2.5 million to Cosey's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would pay attention if he did so much money, but was eventually broken in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an email asking for further information on judicial transactions, but no reply.
Facebook, trying to improve the user's sense of happiness, like!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of well-being, some users will soon like to post others!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, makes it an individual and only posts can be seen.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Mike Garrick, Head of Policy at Facebook Australia, said that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who consider the number of happy surveys and likes to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had a very positive feedback from many affiliated bullying groups and mental health organizations."
It only removes numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange rather than the number of likes and reactions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more securely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights they had access to.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test has been conducted.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when this test will end or change.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experience, but now it's a stage to listen and learn," Garrick said.
Garrick, in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very active "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram user.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If the metal fittings of your favorite bag are broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
Cando's handcrafted parts helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying i'm not selling anymore
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pra product.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main unit greatly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver color.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It is originally used for key holders and charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you align it with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is attached immediately.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So I decided to put the ring in two sets.
The number of metal fittings increased, but because of the lightweight parts, there is no problem with weight at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts has increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, an express train of Japan National Railways, is on a temporary train Hiroshima-Kumamoto, a 10-hour trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train with the image of the JNR express "Aso" = 28 days
People who enjoy a special train trip inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A temporary train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded 12 blue passenger cars from Hiroshima Station and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo between 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days) and was organized by Japanese travelers as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo Line, Chikuho Line, and Kagoshima Line.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother's life imprisonment for the honor murder of kandir barochi, a Pakistani social media star.
Candir Barochi, who was well known for his photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His older brother, Kandir Barochi, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of murdering his sister on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the "Honorary Murder" which attracted the most attention in Pakistan.
Baroch was strangled in July 2016 by his famous self-portraits, which were not as big as Western standards, but were provocative in Pakistan, where women were very strong.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
His brother said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, "Of course," and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of the eastern city of Murtan was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar (a servant of God) will be acquitted in the Supreme Court," the lawyer said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Barochi's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of neglecting the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "honorary murder."
Women have been burned, killed, stabbed or strangled by crimes such as choosing their own marriage partner - in Barochi's case, praising their sexuality and embarrassing their family.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisas and Deya laws allow perpetrators to be pardoned by relatives of the victims.
Three months after Barochi's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, the judge's discretion is to determine whether murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can claim another motive in theory and may be pardoned.
In Barochi's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, his parents changed their mind and asked him to forgive him.
In response to international hatred of murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although criticized and threatened, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the expression of oneself as an existence like Kim Kardashian is considered a bold political activity to improve the status of women.
The origins of the "principal" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

(From left) ASA Amami Sports Academy
[Okinagarabu General Bureau] The NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda and Amami City) and the Okinagara Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda and Chinamachi) signed a partnership for the promotion of remote island sports on February 25.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects carried out by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will establish mutual support systems in terms of health management and prevention of injuries, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both groups mediate and send trainers and instructors for training related to sports, and share information.
When teams from remote islands travel to competitions outside the island, they work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Prefecture Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in the event of a tournament on the mainland, such as a prefectural tournament, support is provided to prevent players from losing their performance due to fatigue during a boat trip or consecutive nights.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players who came from outside the island in cooperation with local orthopedic hospitals and hospitals.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Élabcoco in Chimei-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.
After that, both organizations co-hosted a training session with Athletic Trainer Yuichiro Hidaka.
Local sports boys and club leaders and parents learned how to use taping properly and how to prevent injuries.
Mr. Sonoda (52) said, "In terms of sports environment, the purpose of the activities to eliminate the handicap of remote islands is common to each other, and there are many areas where we can cooperate.
Mr. Maeda (43) said, "It is very encouraging to have a partnership with a proven organization like ASA, and if you want to absorb good points to improve the sports environment for children on remote islands."
Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Mr. Shigeki extorted that he persisted in the conventional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote was overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool guy.
if you are bound by what you should do
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and behavior of people.
When you learn patterns, you will be able to live in Lak because the brain systematizes the behavior.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I'm "mote."
So it's easy to live.
I taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you're stuck with the old pattern of "the university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will live.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I've talked about that in my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come out naturally by admitting that person.
It's not that easy.
It is painful to ask around me.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, his surroundings will be treated as "a wonderful filmmaker."
If you have a track record, you don't have to act great.
In other words, if you are bound by "features," you can't be light.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of position or age, it seems that "cute" in any man will be released and saved.
It is difficult to know what this "cute" is.
what is it?
In the northwestern part of Nigeria, the illegal state doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 in the past four months due to intensified violence.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, a new $35.5 million funding activity will be needed.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist organization that has been working on anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, increased violence in the last 10 months in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina provinces in Nigeria was caused by organized armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barok said on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, assault, murder and sexual violence were frequent, and that raiders destroyed residences and worked for theft.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime groups in the area.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoharam and the West African branch of Islamic State, which was split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," says Balok.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR stated in a statement that, in particular, the security situation in Sokoto was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the coming months.
the new trial date for a man who killed two women and two children is confirmed.

According to Polk County Court records, Marvin Escobar Orellana (31) was prosecuted for first-class murder in three cases, the first-class murder of Marvin Eskibel Lopez, who was named by the police at the time the authorities recognized him.
He pleaded guilty.
According to the police, on 16 July, in a house in Des Moines, he shot Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and her son (5).
The court records that a new date of trial will be determined on January 27, giving the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare.
According to officials of the U.S. Immigration Customs Bureau, Escobar Orellana was illegally staying in the U.S. and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.
The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) launched an advertisement for header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their needs.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system in which multiple bidders (advertisers) compete in fair bids to prioritize high-priced ads to media operated by media companies.
It has been introduced mainly by major media as a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability.
Until now, SSP has been used to provide advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in response to requests from advertisers that "we want to deliver to specific ad frameworks with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP header bids allow them to participate in bidding directly for header bids.
In addition, because the target media company is limited, the advertisement frame of the destination is secured according to the individual commercial materials and brand image, preventing damage to brand value.
One of the advantages for media companies is that LFP's "wrapper solution," a solution that manages the code of each bidder company, can be implemented with the hope of introducing media companies.

Two months suspended as Assistant Professor Yamagata University in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
Yamagata University announced on July 27 that a male assistant professor in his 30s at Yonezawa Campus (Yonezawa City) was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Assistant Professors of the Department of Internal Affairs and Communications, from around October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, had a strong mental stress by repeating intimidating behavior such as being emotional and abused in inappropriate words.
He was a teacher of education and was recognized as having worsened the educational environment.
Several students complained in a survey conducted in September 18.
In December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and in December of the same year, the Yonezawa Campus faculty conducted an investigation to prevent harassment.
Based on the findings of the committee, President Kiyoto Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
Even after the survey, a male assistant professor continued his education, but through interviews, his actions were improved and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deepest sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to make every effort to prevent harassment and restore confidence."
The University also conducts internal research on the alleged sexual harassment of female students led by male faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering.
Cabinet Revolts Requests Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and to compromise with the EU The Sun
Now that only three weeks have passed since the EU summit, there is a growing concern around the Prime Minister that the prime minister may be out of time to withdraw significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion that seeks to lower the demands of withdrawal from the EU and compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system to replace the backstop clauses associated with the Irish border have been clogged, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "impossible."
The Senior Ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose a compromise proposal on the ground, including a three-year time limit on the backstop, to the Conservative Party leader.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the next Conservative annual convention in Manchester.
They demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings, and insist that the EU accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One Cabinet member said Tuesday that the Supreme Court's ruling that the closing of Congress was illegal was "a warning."
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister shall use whatever is available from his steps.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and Cummings' plans are clearly unsuccessful.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to implement the previous prime minister's agreement, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I'm going to tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are a number of reasons for this, and everyone is trying to end this.
If we do not postpone, Boris will end and we will all end.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party gave a harsh speech: "The prime minister told us that he wanted to make an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to form an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs with the Whales, and discussing with the people in the streets - as if the election campaign was in full swing."
The prime minister's spokesman admitted yesterday that the agreement was still a long way ahead, saying, "No one should think of it - if it is to achieve the goal, the road is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben bill, which would force a three-month postponement in case of an uncontracted withdrawal, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that the bill hinders our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are working hard to keep moving forward despite the bill's passage."
Stephen Berkeley, Minister of Departure of the European Union, returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by the television boss that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, 59 years old, said he was "very nervous."
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before I took over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone on the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I will never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kilbride, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scotland branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly was the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorraine.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, she will broadcast a special show about Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
The host said that passion and enthusiasm and curiosity were the key to survival in the television industry, and added, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and honest.
Do what you should do, get interested in and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck her heart, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting incident was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I never thought that many families of children who were killed or injured watched us live broadcast the show from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, one of her mother's five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, said that she personally wanted to see me, so we talked for hours at her house.
Not taking it all on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very hard" and "very respecting the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the pain and pain of the net that they do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing a trap.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of a presidential post from former President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to anxiety that it might be a trap to refute military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Chiwenga declined the offer because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was stripped of his administration in a coup, rather than from anxiety.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirmed that officials were senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who had been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munnagagwa," it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
Mugabe, aware that he was losing power, told the government officials that he had made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was done by three persons.
President Spokesman George Charamba, deputy head of the Central Intelligence Agency at that time Aaron Nepera and Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Muconoli were involved in the negotiations, and high officials said.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to condemn the African Union's military actions while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the presidency to the former CDF was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was an act of abandonment to help some of the late president's family begin to suffer from fatigue and to save a dangerously rapid expansion," he wrote.
However, there were some political aims of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If there was anything to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and destroy the claims of the commanders claiming that he did not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had yet to determine whether it would be a coup without fully grasping the entire situation, would eventually be called a coup and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe moved when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the presidential house called Blue Roof, they would not turn guns on the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things: to protect his family and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa (we belong to the camouflage group) " were used in the words of a messenger (gono), who told the president's desperate message, and a powerful metaphor for "if we are not politicians, we are not just in political competition."
The Army told the other commanders of the region that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe, but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coup and successors, Mugabe attempted to bring back Manangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at the time, the South Africans, who were key to this process, refused to intervene, but threatened repeatedly behind it, clarifying that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources state.
The World's Nuclear Weapons Convention | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
[Joint New York] On the 26th, a meeting was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.
Five new countries have ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and 32 have ratified it.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, established by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech, expressing strong concern in recent years that there is a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

China needs strong leadership, otherwise collapse - policy documents
Prior to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will face division and collapse, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified dealing with problems in a rigid manner, such as the repression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989.
President Xi Jinping, who is the leading figure in the world's second largest economic power memorial ceremony, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he held power in late 2012.
Xi has also overseen military modernization programs that threaten the region.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export the development model of its own country, and does not intend to adopt a model of other countries.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the powerful, and war and chaos left a deep scar with that pain; China would never take the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult problems such as economic stagnation and anti-government protests in Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "abandon" its core interests, nor allow its security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"The threat of trade wars and rising tariffs are no problem-solving," White Paper states in relation to trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and momentum for strong economic development.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities and opening a new world.
China has no idea of countering the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., so the U.S. should consider China's development calmly.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko.
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as the coach, and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local newspaper had a rumor about baseball club members.
After hearing the situation from the two students, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the interviews with 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they generally accepted the facts and dismissed them on 28th.
Yokohama was defeated in the summer of 15 by Motochika WATANABE (74), who raised Shosaka Daisuke and others.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
From summer 16 to summer 16 he participated in Koshien for three consecutive years, and this spring he also participated in Senbatsu.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara, the prefectural capital, in the semifinals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals, and in the next spring he was desperate.
Spice Girls' Mel C, eating disorders, and dieting in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom admitted that the family had banned diets from eating any food other than fruits and vegetables for many years.
Sporty spices have been "excessive exercise" for many years under pressure from members of the global pop group, and have subsequently been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chisom told her that her experience had influenced her daughter Scarlett's child-rearing and that "every topic about diet in her home is prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his own appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, still in front of SNS, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that "bad" comments about himself written in the press led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, I became obsessed with exercise more and more, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Judiciary judgment on same-sex marriage: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch made a decision to approve the case in which 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage was established even between same sex.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, and there is a system in which local governments, such as Sapporo City, certify same-sex partnerships, are not legally effective in Japan.
Based on this, the court recognized the fact that two women were actually married.
It is considered the first judicial decision to allow same-sex couples to have legal protection.
The same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of civil law and family register law, and a lawsuit is filed in five district courts, such as Sapporo, to seek damages to the country as unconstitutional.
We would like to deepen our understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system for recognizing diverse families.
Women lived together for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the United States.
The court ruled that "the reality of factual marriage between men and women is not the same" due to the fact that the two lived together.
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of fact-marriage with the same-sex rights, such as social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that defines marriage as "only based on mutual consent."
Both sexes were considered "unpresumably same-sex marriages at the time of establishment, so it is not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
Although the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, since the same-sex marriage was not recognized, the issue remained that the amount of compensation was reduced, as "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women."
It may be difficult to distinguish the right to protect while recognizing the reality of equal status between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, 70% of the respondents believed that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a spouse recognized by law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in the tax system and the lack of joint custody.
In the examination of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriage between same-sex couples but also the expansion of legal rights for actual marriage.
to the trial and jury of former athletes prosecuted for rape of multiple women.
A jury trial is held for former Delaware University baseball players who have been accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's life luck.
A 21-year-old woman stated that she was sexually assaulted after she drove Conaway home.
The two met after three weeks at the meeting site Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women's contradictory claims and differences in memory might have regretted having physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure "It's the next season to take the pennant." - Yahoo! News
In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final game of this season, and the possibility of his own entry into CS failed.

He was a fan of some.
At the end of the speech, he said, "I will do my best to rob Penant next season."
However, when asked by the press about the event after the ceremony, he said, "It's not finished yet, so it's all."
【Dospo】Oda is the 4th and 20th most self-registered after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
It became a reward for the seniors.
Four times in one lead, he ran his 20th home run with a liner on the left.
I reached the number of home runs that I was aiming at, and I said, "I stopped this number and tried and tried again, and it became a big one."
The director's intention was also firm.
This was the first time a four-year contract was signed.
He said, "I put it in fourth place so that I could swing unexpectedly."
Oda responded to his expectations: "I felt that way, and as a result I entered the game, I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal 4 statues is the giant Abe who retired from active duty this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads to victory, and the 4th is the team's 4th and the 4th seniors I've seen with the giants were the same."
Among them, "Mr. Abe came to mind the most, he was a reliable person, and he looked at his back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, the video clearly
Sydney Harbour is one of Sydney's largest tourism resources, bringing $2109 million to the Australian economy every year, with opera houses, Circler Keys, Luna Park and some famous Harbor Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the dirtiest places.
According to a new video of the title "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are full of suckers, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing rainwater into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting waterways.
Dr. Katherine Dafoon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
Although its appearance is certainly beautiful, it is one of the most polluted estuaries of Japan.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour is expected to flow into the waterway, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"There were heavy rains several times, but Sydney Harbour was... quite tragic," Dr. Daffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastics that flow into the ocean are deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go under the sea level, you don't know what's there," said Richard Nichols, owner of the Dyb Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what's under the water) then everyone will be really surprised.
Although overwhelming, more than half of the items we discover are plastic bags.
The remaining half is made of plastic at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing right under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said that it is possible for local residents and tourists to reduce the amount of plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the amount of plastic used, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so you have to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a source of food.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, which is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, coincided with the release of the video funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of an effort to promote awareness of the environmental protection of Australian citizens and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers remaining in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between 12 and 18 have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also stated that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed felt increasingly uneasy about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Plant was demolished in October | Saga News|Saga Newspapers
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which began demolition work in October, is Futako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it will begin to dismantle the chimney of the former Karatsu Power Plant (oil-fired power plant) in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The two cars were used to emit gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991 due to aging.
Each chimney is split from one tower crane and dismantled.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine buildings and boilers have not been demolished.
A man in his 60s who runs a restaurant nearby said, "When I look back from afar and see a chimney, it's like a symbol that made me feel back in Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Plant began operation in 1967, and the first was abolished in 89 and the second was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225 thousand square meters.
Due to the proximity of Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three people, including nine electric cars, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

I am now (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Maya Takahashi, a free announcer and commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," talked about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save me.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is more like a teacher than a father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I am different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do it, and what is important as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was told that I was a connor or a busaik, my father said, "If I thought it was a connor, but it wasn't so.
After that, around the second or third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty female anna can do it," and even when I didn't get motivated because I didn't want to do the job I wanted to do, even when my heart was rotten, "Who can do the job is working hard."If so, "I asked everyone to do it," but I was glad to be in charge of Mama.
i learned naturally from my father's acting.
There may be many people who have never seen me read the news, but in fact, since I joined the TV station, I have always been exposed to the news through the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought that the personality and sense of the announcer will also come out when reading the news manuscript.
When I read the news, I feel important and sensed is "between."
It has been cultivated through watching father's stage, movies, TV and period dramas as a child.
More importantly, I think that my father's work on variety shows and how to deal with them is thanks to various experiences of my childhood.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18 cards.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships under the jurisdiction of the International Automobile Federation (FIA).
It has been held every year since 1973 and has become the world's highest rally championship, boasting history and tradition.The competition is said to be the toughest car competition because it runs not only on closed roads (paved roads), but also on various roads such as gravel and snow roads at high speed.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparation Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Mr. Hideaki Omura, Governor of Aichi Prefecture
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work with relevant parties to ensure that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Japan as the center of motorsports representing Japan and that it will be a major event to appeal to the world.
Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament in the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you here."
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motor Sports, commented on the Japan Round.

The Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 test event will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is Tasmanian devil the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmanian devils may be the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient care.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells camouflaged.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will create a new way to treat cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including a researcher at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy may significantly alter their treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing deadly face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils, which are on the verge of extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camflage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to no longer attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and Merkel cells.
Peter McCallum researcher Mark Dawson said, "What is very important in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Traditional therapies may be reused to reactivate markers, or proteins known as MHC, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where cancer cells escape detection in the same way.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process occurs in humans and Tasmanian devil cancer," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, they may help control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and marveled at the solar system, which covers the current understanding of planetary formation, as giant Jupiter-type planets orbit around a small star called red dwarf, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting its main star around the red dwarf was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not much different, researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% the size of the Sun, but the planet orbiting around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, led this research published in the journal Science.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, only about 35 percent larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380 °C / 3527 °C).
That's why I have a reddish color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining its elliptical orbit.
Planets are produced from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which created their own orbiting stars.
The most influential model of planetary formation, called the "core accumulation" model, is that the object is formed from solid particles in the disk, and the gravity produced by the egg of the planet causes the surrounding gas to become atmospheric.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might have been slightly larger than it was thought and the temperature was lower," Morales said.
In this state, the disk becomes unstable, so some dense areas may appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a coworker who eats a soy dip containing a stimulant
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is accused of eating a dip of beans with a stimulant.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of transferring methane fetamine and taking regulatory drugs to others for Class B felonies.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit obtained from OregonLive.com, a suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "After eating something, I thought it tasted strange, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach became sick and her legs were fluffy.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have contained methane fetamine in the beans dip.
According to The Smoking Gunn, another Sliftway employee told Medina Hernández that he had "decked" the victim's food, while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he had accidentally put methane fetamine in a bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Derri shows Medina Hernández turning his camera back and clinginging behind a microwave, but taking something out of the brager.
After that, he stood up and wiped his nose, walked toward the table and put a dip of beans in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Stateman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was placed in Marion County jail instead of a bail of $5.2 million.
According to The Smoking Gunn, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of felony by assault, robbery, spoofing, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Asks can be organized" President of JR Tokai attaches importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on the 27th, Shin Kaneko, President of JR Tokai, reiterated the importance of early construction, stating that "it is better to separate the issues that are being discussed with Shizuoka Prefecture in relation to the decrease in the flow rate of the Oi River due to the construction of the South Alps tunnel of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen."
Specifically, he said, "We will talk at the meeting place and at the front stage."
President Kaneko said, "When we organize all the problems, it's not easy to start construction, and I think it's possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea, we have to talk to the prefecture."
The prefecture is concerned that the spring water from the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that it would be difficult to think about the safety of the construction, although it would be possible to do it realistically.
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the route change mentioned was "not possible."
President Kaneko pointed out three locations: Minami Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station and Nagoya Station, which are particularly time-consuming for construction.

Trump Hotel owner complained about the suitability, but also retained the liquor sales license.
Washington (AP) - The Board of Alcohol and Beverage Auditors in Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel due to questioning the suitability of the owner.
On Wednesday, three MPs, two former judges and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on a state law that requires the applicant's "suitability" to obtain a liquor license.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year cited Trump's assault charges and repeated fraud, claiming it violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the license was already granted.
This was the second time that a petition was issued to update the permit.

How is the taste of honey collected by Flying Bees bred at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September 2019.
More than 100 honey bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make beekeeping on the site of a factory that assembled cars?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honey beets produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers have been watching the bees from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains collecting various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities through its Crew Plant and our business to become the top sustainable luxury car manufacturer, and the breeding of bees is part of this.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully completed, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the amount of bentree honey harvested.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to fulfill our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million honey bees "Flying Bees" were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator, filtered the fallen honey, and then bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with a Bentley-like commitment.
The label was designed by Louise McCallum, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we would like to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey such as scones.
The Cleveland Police, a series of scandalous reports, is the worst in Britain.
A police officer who followed the scandal was declared the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continued "a serious deterioration," says Phil Gomley of the Police Directorate.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley of the Police Directorate said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Mike Wiel, Chief of Police, resigned in January less than a year before taking office, but he was "deeply" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Lieutenant Simon Herwood, last year, went to the Commission for Investigation of Illegal Acts because he directed his colleagues to do sexual acts.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Interior intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I have full responsibility for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal," and impeachment has to be settled.
Nobody knows what will happen next.
At present, we believe that we are involved in a cover-up affair, which may take some time to investigate," Pelosi told CNN in Congress.
"I'm going to do a job that I'm starting to do based on the time it takes to discover facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Vladimir Zerensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor Rudy Giulani.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security lawyer in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before the formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of political financing violations.
In response to Burr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee decided to call out who to testify.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched upon Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the telephone talks with the Ukrainian president in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make decisions regarding the treatment of this accusation.
Pelosi stated that he was "very concerned" about the whistleblowers that Trump attacked the whistleblower as a spy on Thursday and hinted that he had been treated differently in the past.
The president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about those who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump about the alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political gain.
The call content is included in the accusations released on Thursdays, where whistleblowers claim that Trump abused his office in the upcoming 2020 presidential election to "see intervention" in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-level computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian bentheke, speed violation prohibited driving
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, is likely to be banned from driving.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old forward admitted on January 20, that he had driven his Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 speed limit in Richmond, southwest London.
The Belgians then photographed a speed violation camera in Patney, south-west London, driving 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not have to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek was convicted of these two violations under a single trial procedure in which one justice of the peace tried and sentenced to light crimes.
9.2% of Taiwanese high school students "experienced" rate increase in contraception = Health Authorities Survey (Central Focus Taiwan) - Yahoo! News
(Taipei 27) National Health Department of Health and Welfare (Ministry of Health) announced the results of the survey on sexual intercourse among high school students in Taiwan on September 26.
According to this, 9.2% of students answered that they had experience.
It was revealed that about five of them did not have contraception.
The survey was conducted in 2017 for students enrolled in high schools, specialty high schools and vocational schools.
Compared to the previous survey, the percentage of students with sexual intercourse decreased slightly from 11.1%.
On the other hand, 22.6% of men and women aged 15-17 answered that they did not contraceptive due to the latest sexual activity, exceeding 19.2% in the previous year.
The breakdown is 28.8% of males (22.6%) and 12.2 percent of females (14.5 percent).
The station pointed out that there are many opportunities for young people to get information on the Internet, and it is easy to bias their way of thinking by interacting with incorrect information.
The lack of contraception calls for correct knowledge not only for pregnancy but also for increased risk of infection.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu is concerned about the composition of the judging committee.
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the upcoming GFA elections.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davids and expressed his dissatisfaction with this.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu stated that the chairman had a stake in the results of the review process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The judging committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from an outside party with no prior interest, whether it is related to each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu countered that he had interests and that his commission should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4.
The chairman is Frank Davis, a Corporate Governance Consultant, and the chairman is Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Appocavi, sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage to be 1,000 yen per hour.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and only 30% for non-regular employees.
The number of companies who answered "approved" to raise the hourly salary to 1,000 yen was 100 percent, construction (70, 6 percent), and wholesale (61, 7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink and lodging.
The representative of the conference said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with high part-time and hourly wages."
The average amount paid by companies who answered "the opposite" was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, there were 61.3% of regular employees, 54.5% mid-term employment, and 15.4% non-regular employment.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (37.5%, 37.5%) and construction industry (24.1%, 38.1%).
As a result, 86.4% of the total number of applicants had problems in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the company's reputation was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (2 years after graduation).
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the government's sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy said they already recognized it.
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total showed acceptance.
There were 64.4% of companies that were "not admitted" and high construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%) and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tipplick said that Wales will host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Walla Beads, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will likely be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory over Wales was the 14th victory, Tiprick and his team would be a straight line in the best eight races with England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to win and finish at the top of the group," said Tiprick, a Welshman.
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last fall.
I think Australia will be quite blaming to return the debt, but I will do my best to win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And now I'm here, it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and has won third place since 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gutland, the Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight 3 team achieved only seven victories in 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was included in several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
Certainly the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it was impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, he scored about 15 points in the final game, so he seemed to have been far more competitive."
To win Wales, the key is the break-down battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, an Australian duo worshiped as Back Law.
Up until now, Tiprick has played 67 international matches, and has fought several matches or both players in the past.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you will be facing a tough game from now on.
They are always the best in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the world's most defensive backs players, and Michael is an aggressive backsman, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense of doing it properly when needed.
I want to fight with the best player in the world and improve myself rather than confronting the so strong Bucklow.
I want to fight with the best opponents, and if I play against them, I have to keep up with myself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brought '90 percent of the gala', would it really be a gift from a comedian?
A series of problems with Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by the black sales of antisocial forces have also been resolved.
President Akihiko Okamoto said at a press conference on July 22 that "the company has no talent at 9 and there is no such thing as 1," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the "9:1" ratio, it would be considered that there was a gift from comedians to Yoshimoto, and investors who were paying taxes were also tweeted on Twitter.
If the amount of Galla is "9:1," is there a gift tax?
I heard from Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen is "9:1," Yoshimoto Kogyo will earn 1 million yen in sales and 1 million yen in expenses.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should declare your tax and pay your corporate tax already.
Also, even if you think about the allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying or selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a problem in calculating taxes.
However, as in this case, a third party will not be able to decide how much tax-appropriate prices are for those transactions that both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think it's a poison to pay for one yen.
[Interviewing Cooperation Tax Attorney] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working at a bank, he registered as a tax accountant in 2008.
There are a wide range of activities, including university lecturers, seminars and writing.

the white house, a panic without impeachment.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, explaining that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Building seems to be increasing "awareness, anxiety, and worry" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't really know what it is."
The White House official joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, or that the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied, so there was no confidence in how to proceed because this claim was so serious.
Another person familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere of the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's unwavering response to this impeachment interrogation would increase the likelihood of "injury."
Another source of information is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is seen to be raised every day, and there are some close associates who believe that the president will act "impulsive."
Trump has taken increasingly unpredictable actions and spurred concerns about the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about presidents and politics in the election year environment.
Trump faced the greatest threat he had ever faced during his term of office, and reviving his strategy during Robert Moller's Russian investigation that he considered effective, he changed his mind, becoming an attacker or a defense.
Trump attempted to neglect the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of whistleblowers as a motive for partisan conflict.
However, many White House officials have endured Mora's trials, but this time they are beginning to feel the difference.
The president, whose power is considered a brand, seemed to be coming to the press conference on Wednesday, said a detailed person in this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have answered questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that the damage can be mitigated, claiming it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information on the call with President Trump and Vladimir Zerensky, who are controversial, and Ukrainian presidents.
Moreover, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategy close to the White House points out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and that the impeachment will not have much effect on the acquisition of new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with legislative proposals and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President for the next four months."
Another source stated that those claiming impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how uncertain the response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to an official who explained the plan, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader who can organize public relations in an offensive manner in order to counter the momentum that the publication and publication of organized legal strategies and communication strategies and critical internal accusations have given the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin stated that they would not publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later, stating that the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible.
According to a person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called Trump's external pitbull and Corrie Luwandouski, former head of the campaign headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be a leader in such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never talked with the president or close advisers about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in impeachment by Clinton and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left Pat Siporon, now White House's legal adviser, with little experience and now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
Details of the White House strategy are generally aware that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but need to be organized and capable of leading all-out response and political struggle.

"It's been a lot of work for my father and the rest of the world, and it's still going on."
"The final part of Natsuzora was over, and it ended for half a year, but at the end I thought it was a good ending with the feeling that it was well organized.I was also tired of the performers and production staff again, and the narration of Utchan saying that it would continue to be the 101st Dora was good."
In addition, in the final episode, "It's lonely that you can't see natsuzo from next week.Natsu-chan, grandpa, thank you for half a year."Natsuzora"Losss such as "I'm lonely from tomorrow."

In such a situation, how can we connect the situation with our allies to marriage?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Professor Morikawa's advice derived from detailed data analysis is mandatory.
what's this?
I am worried whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during a long-distance relationship.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I work and have my family, but his place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from distant love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (hereinafter - -) C is in a distant relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested at a distance and the two become stronger."
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) Speaking of long-distance love, DeNA Travel's survey conducted in August 2017 and 1147 people answered it.
Since love is done with five senses, the relationship deepens with seeing the partner (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touch sensation), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to your opponent's house, you will be burdened with time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even if you are on a holiday to heal the tiredness of your work, your body is kata.
I feel refreshed when I return home.
Does that mean you have to break up when you're far away?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple that you can endure without having to meet frequently or a couple that has a long time to leave.
You'll be engaged a year later, or you'll be back from work two years later.
It may be difficult if you do not see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of demanding Trump's nude pictures.
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable for the idea that President Donald Trump will be investigated.
Thursday, in a comment defending the president, accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain presidential nude photos.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive at the House of Representatives Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had requested to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the leftists and their media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes, Huffpost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democrats were looking for the truth.
Only Congressman Jim Heims of the Democratic Party of Connecticut has responded so far, but many other members are questioning whether the answer is red-naked truth.
Mediate.com speculates that Nunes' nude comments may be related to the "more detailed and unidentified" part of Steele's controversial document.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape," which is said to be reflected in Trump watching prostitutes urinate in a hotel room in Moscow, suggesting existence.
Origami, wallet and real cards.
Money transfer, loan, insurance, investment - Yahoo! News
In addition to paying by Origami Pay, Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to withdraw money (moving) through remittances and collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
There is also a charge function.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing can be used at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the challenges of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates."

Regenerative biofuel research can reduce emissions
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only airplane to fly in the air and not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology that enables renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor of the Department of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, launched the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude fuel, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The achievement of this technology in the first generation is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as biofuel for jets.
The first is a low-risk approach, which requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that have already been partially developed to maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bressler described the second option as "can be tested with a nuclear reactor to change a little chemical reaction."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Forge currently operates a testing plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build 25 million US production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million litres of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bressler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate does not increase in fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bressler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple choices can be made in parallel with the decisions made after the explanation.

Boris Johnson warns the British that if Brexit is overturned, the British will face riots like Los Angeles, and the prime minister will call for calm.
A senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson said he needed to "quench anger" against the political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but insisted that he would not use the term "defeat."
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain calm, one minister told The Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gile Joan or the Los Angeles riots of 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a book called the Yellow Best Movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black taxi driver, to a verdict of not guilty.
This year, the French anti-government demonstrators Gire Joan, wearing the eye-catching yellow vest, have been causing confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the street.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum had overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to hold a general election and entrust Brexit to voters.
Johnson is reported to have been facing a House of Representatives rebellion, calling for lower demands on EU withdrawal and instead to hit the EU with a compromise.

pakistan, brother of social media celebrity, was sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memories of the incident fade.
"It takes too long to forget people," said the women's rights activist Farzana Bali, Pakistan's first gender faculty founder, adding that even the case of Barochi, which is attracting attention, took more than three years to solve.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honorary murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much more than that, because Pakistan estimates that about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings of honor-based violence surveillance organizations worldwide every year.
11.3 billion yen countermeasures against pork cholera To add to the September compensation plan in Shizuoka Prefecture (Magyo Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A total of 148 million yen was added to the September supplementary budget plan, which was reported by the Congressional Steering Committee on the 26th.
It is proposed to the prefectural assembly on the 27th.

Floods and disruptions caused by prolonged monsoons in many parts of India
The monsoon season in India has been prolonged for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their power in early September, but the average rainfall in this month is usually 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, the monsoon will weaken at the latest decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays destroyed buildings and killed several people.
The houses are flooded, and the inhabitants walk through the streets with water on their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Raknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains have caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
For farmers, prolonged monsoons are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmhouse in Bimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables will rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is on October 8 in Dashela, where the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, the evil laughing figure of a beard-boom appearing in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, the last laugh may be Ravana.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides could increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
Current studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may lead to higher risk of heart disease.
This is the result of more than 30 years of follow-up survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii.
Compared to male groups that did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"This study highlights the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides at work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure at work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of the Department of Elderly Care at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from over 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuaquini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women or other races because it only targets Japanese-American males.
As pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year follow-up study, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said in a press release.
This is probably due to the increased importance of other factors related to aging and the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease and heart attack are not important.
Poloshenko intervention in Zerensky Trump telephone talks
The impeachment procedure for U.S. President Donald Trump was a radical week in Washington's political affairs.
For political beginners Vladimir Zerensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
But what has been known about the Zelensky Trump phone problem so far, and is there a widespread impact on Zelensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not literal, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on specific proposals.
Zelensky's response to Trump's 1000% argument is controversial.
Zelensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for support from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for support including EU sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytica said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then hinted at military aid and asked Zelensky to investigate two rather than one, one against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the other about the server of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic e-mail fraud during the 2016 election.
It is uncertain whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone.
"We thank the people who helped us with the announcement of the call record," Zerensky said at the New York General Assembly.
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana with an interim rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification survey (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Air Organization's Global Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was recognized by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO on safety at airports and in their own airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's delayed national zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for safety evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was awarded to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director General of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Nii Icoi Otou, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada, and Yau Kuwakwa, Director of Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Olmiwa Bennard Aliu stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to remain aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada said that this award complements the indomitable efforts and perseverance of the sector and is a gift of Ghanaian efforts.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but they are all safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump and Peter Gino are appointed as FEMA Chiefs: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Senate Committee in Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
FEMA's deputy director, Gino, was in charge of overseeing government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been vacant since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Department of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, determined that Mr. Long had illegally used government-owned vehicles to commute between Washington and his home, Norcarorina.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, raised suspicions that he was drunk and involved in a riot, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of the month after consideration.
Mr. Gaynor's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will require approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Bureau in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.

After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m., suspected of selling illegal marijuana pen-type beeps, a large container of Butanhanie oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found in an office building located at 9600 blocks on Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found equipment to pack the beep cartridge.
"This process is very dangerous," said Cano.
Capt. Cano had previously been involved in drug investigations and stated that there was a possibility of a fire in the process of extracting oil used for the beep product.
"The static electricity from the clothes alone can ignite, and since it is in a concentrated state, it causes not only fire but also explosions."
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, it could cause explosions one after another and not only fire but also the entire building to be blown away.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigators said they received some anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activity.
The investigators are still trying to figure out who the illegal burp activity is.
The police said that Zhang himself believed that the office had a store in the office because the office was empty.
As the investigation continued, police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to prevent illegal babyping products from appearing again.
"I don't know whether it's real or not," he said.
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a significant impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to get close to these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a huge earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6!
Evacuation training at Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
A practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held every year.
On stage, a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department is actually performed, and an earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6 is expected to occur during the song.
About 300 people including kindergarten children, local residents and hall staff participated in the training on the 27th.

(Interviewed in Hall)
"It's an earthquake, it's an earthquake, it's an earthquake.
After that, the participants were evacuated to the entrance in anticipation of a fire.
Earthquakes that do not know when and where to occur.
The participants increased their awareness of disaster prevention through training.
exhibited at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver leaf threads, and lavish embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Herre Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, is determined to be one point.
Lin saw this faded piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in one rural area, which was placed there 100 years ago, and is considered to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally found this gorgeous cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited next month at Hampton Court Palace, near exactly the room where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one other dress left in the 16th century proved to be an important discovery throughout the Royal Dress Collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of her sleeves to the dress, three years of research have raised the conviction of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The exquisitely expensive textile "cloth made of silver thread" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but the embroidery of plants and flowers with "name" quality also suggests that the patterns of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later were noble people.
At the time the dress was made, it seems that it was a price equivalent to a Tudor mansion.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or could not tolerate rivals wearing such luxury clothing.
Lin said it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
I was always very happy to say, "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of a piece of dress, cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton, seems unexpected but not so.
Baxton is a native village of Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life.
Although the dress dates back to 1590, experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Parry before Elizabeth died in 1603.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on very delicate hand-sewing altar cloths, will be displayed next to the portrait of Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and led by Libby Thompson, "When dealing with historical fabric, I feel really respect for the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the front and the back of the embroidery, you will find a great respect for the person who made it.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched" One week after missing girls, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew Volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
A week after Misaki Ogura, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared, the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village called for the withdrawal of the Self-Defense Forces to search for the requested area, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk, such as mountain slopes and Sawa.
Also, on the 27th, the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search were not known.
The police and fire department will continue to search from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
As a result of the appeal, the plaintiffs sued the election invalid because the value of one vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member was the lowest in the country in July this year.
In the first oral speech held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendant's side called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It is not said that the issue of unconstitutional law was in an extremely unequal state, but it should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on October 30.

Isuzu's large truck Giga, the latest model to be released worldwide...Tokyo Motor Show 2019 (Response) - Yahoo! News
Isuzu Motors will release the latest model of "Giga" for the first time in the world at "Tokyo Motor Show 2019" held at Tokyo Big Sight from October 24 to November 4.
In addition to the latest advanced safety equipment, Isuzu's flagship model, Giga, has added new equipment to reduce fatigue to drivers.
It contributes to safe driving through pre-clash brakes that detect pedestrians and cyclists, blind spot monitors that help prevent accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists during left turn and lane changes, and variable light LED headlamps.
In addition, it contributes to reducing the fatigue of the driver by cruises between full-speed millimeter-wave vehicles and new high roof cabs that follow the preceding car at full speed.
In addition, vehicle operation and dynamic management systems also expanded vehicle condition items.
New monitoring of the operation status of safety equipment and support safe operation.
In addition, the world premiere of "FL-IR," which expresses the future logistics network as a show model.
FL-IR focuses on the ultrasonic conversation and behavioral habits seen in fishes, as well as the similarities between connected and troop running.
The exterior incorporates a bio-design that gives an efficient image of a robot with the motif of "same" and features a style that contrasts the pre-filtered cab with an organic shape that breaks the wind and the rigid aero device covering it.
The interior features a layer design that replaces dashboards with manual and automatic driving mode changes.
The seat is placed in the center and combines comfortable operation and habitability.
The next generation of small delivery vehicles, the ElfEV Walkthrough van, will also be the first worldwide release.

Arriving at Space Station, Unmanned Supplies | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
"Konotori" No. 8, an unmanned supply vehicle that arrived at the International Space Station.
The robot arm of the station is growing from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th (JAXA provided)
On the night of 28th, Konotori No. 8 (JAXA) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), a drone carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), arrived near the station.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced with the control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, the speed difference is eliminated, and it approaches about 10 meters away.
The robot arm is 17 and 6 meters long and grabs the supply machine.
The aircraft had about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After installation on the station, the flight attendants carry out the luggage.
Mexican drug cartel executives, one third of the drug in the United States
Shortly after the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured a rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was happening in the daytime.
Nearly 800 people died of overdose in Chicago last year.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king, commonly known as El Mencho, Nemecio Cervantes.
Matthew Donahew DEA executive officer in Mexico said, "Mencho is a DEA and, in fact, a top-prior of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in El Mencho were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva Enellación (CJNG), is involved in at least a third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "massive" cocaine, methane fetamine, and phentanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's head is awarded a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From the death of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho does not punish and defends his empire.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by drug cartels.
According to Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the solder.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of toxic substances that effectively capture the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child dies, it is "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Tennoji Zoo (Tennoji Ward, Osaka City) held a farewell party of male koala "ARK" in Osaka Prefecture on August 28.
In mid-October, it was decided to rent a zoo in the UK for 10 years, and it is likely not to return.
thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of Koalasha, where eucalyptus grows, spared their part.
He is 12 years old.
Coala's breeding life spans 15 to 20 years, and it is thought that he will complete tenju in the UK where he is married.
Mr. Hideki Tsujimoto (40), the keeper in charge, cried, "It is hard to put the curtain down on the raising of the koala, and it is full of gratitude."
Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the old days
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition The Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent state of play announcement, Sony announced the release date of its sequel, Last of As, February 2020.
Some of the video footage of this new action game was also presented to fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 news.
Sony and Noty Dog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
Since the PS1 era, the last of as part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Noty Dog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"The story is magnificent and complicated in a different way than the previous one," Drackman said.
In this way, it was necessary to make the story bigger.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved to that extent.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but it was actually the beginning and I realized that all the other sections started."
The game was so spectacular that it did not enter a single Blu-ray that it had two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
There is no need to ruin this surprise, but Easter Eggs in the game include nostalgic Noty Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the sequel release.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
MLB The Show 19 will be released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including a popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replica, and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Save" Council Try Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th, on Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, the Noto Island Regional Development Council (Notoshima Regional Development Council) was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings and food crossed the Somachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
There were also products that were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents said that it was fun to choose goods.
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even elderly people living alone, a total of vegetables such as potato salad and kinpira gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
In the town of Suso, the population was formed and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I never thought it would sell so much."
Ms. Mitsue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
The user also ordered "I want you to have coffee that you drip on your own rather than canned coffee."
The council will consider what was requested.
There is currently only one convenience store in Notoshima where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to help "shopping weak."
Until December, the 20 town councils on the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they will continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to add $100 million to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been revised significantly to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be allocated to the drought-affected community support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to 100 million dollars of drought relief money for infrastructure development and disaster prevention.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted over $7 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife's family in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen, Katie Stay, and four of his five children.
The authorities said on July 9, 2014, Haskell was forced into his residence and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department announced that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 sons, and 9 and 7 daughters were killed.
Only one of his family, Cassidy Stay, was 15 years old at the time.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed until Monday's trial.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook her anger resonated with the leaders of each country.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and helped spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and irritability protested all over the world, including Japan.
It is estimated that about 4 million people attended in more than 150 countries.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will be launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to 1/5.
All participating countries shall take measures in accordance with each other without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is pointed out to be related to global warming.
In order to achieve a faster pace of global warming, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit achieved by the call of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to intensify the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to virtually zero by 50 years.
Other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become conspicuous.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy has set zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of this century, but the gap between countries aiming at "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Shinjiro Koizumi, who demonstrated Japan's efforts at environmental meetings, said at a conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
Although the appeal is not denied, it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The unconstitutional scars would be nothing more than the "replacement of issues" that the person himself counters.
The international community has to deal with the common crisis of humanity.
It can not be effective enough if there are deviations in each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
You should act as an adult to avoid taking away that future.
to realize quantum internet
The U.S. Army's research results have led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and timekeeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute Distributed Quantum Information Center of the United States Army Combat Capability Development Department, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Innsbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and measured in one, even if one quantum bit is physically far from the other, the measurement results in the other are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, an experimental physicist and project leader at Innsbruck University, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network is composed of a network between physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distance.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum internet.
"This proof is a big step in realizing large-scale distributed enthanglement," says Sarah Gamble, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
The enthanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured in ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
In his team, he first sent light particles through nonlinear crystals with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, the optimal value for long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
The measurement results showed that the atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured simultaneously with high-quality "clock" quantum bits, which leads to the realization of an entangled network of long-distance atomic clocks.
The large entangled clock network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate position measurement, navigation and time-keeping applications," said Frederick Fatemi, an Army researcher who co-operated the program.
