PayPay salesman "I'm on the Wave" "I'm on the Wave" cashless wake up "I'm on the Wave" I wonder if the waves will swell (Tokai TV) - Yahoo!
Tax increase starting in October.
In line with this, the country begins the cashless point reduction project.
Reducing up to 5% to reduce the coldness of consumption is a "cashless" condition.
[See in the image] just before the tax increase...
So what's happening now is "introduction."
This is a cashless store that was previously a cash business.
We were close to the installation site.
[Cashlessing] immediately before the tax hike
"Okakiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular shop operated by Takeyoshi confectionery, and there are more than 100 kinds of oysters and arashi in the shop.
Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users, visited Tatsushin on this day.
PayPay Yasuda: "Is there any payment method other than cash?
Mr. Shinmi, President of Takeyoshi Co., Ltd.: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it's easier than cash if you get used to it because it won't be possible to receive the suspension.
To date, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce the usage by 20% by points.
Although the number of users has increased dramatically, Yasuda is an "employee man" who sells the introduction of PayPay to customers, that is, shops.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also heard from Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's peak now, and if you haven't been able to talk about it before, or if you're going to do a consumer return business together, you're registered as a member of PayPay, and now you're riding a wave."
"Cashless Wave" ride in the national consumer return business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves in the country's Consumer Reducing Business.
With the consumption tax increase from October, the government introduced a system to reduce the maximum amount of shopping to consumers by 5% to prevent the cooling of consumption.
As in "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before tax increases.

What is the representative Münchhausen syndrome that appeared in Netflix's The Politicians?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are ill.
The Politicians are broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, the president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinness Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness where parents behave as if they were physical or mental illness, even though the person under their protection is not really sick.
There are various types of pathologies, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is hypothesized to be a disease of himself.
However, the surrogate Münchhausen syndrome clearly implies that others under their protection are ill.
It is also known as FII or FII, a type of child abuse.
Although it is a rare symptom, parents usually exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if children were sick.
So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following caution.
The child is healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make the child feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Excessive medications and other drugs cause symptoms of disease.
How common is the surrogate Münchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that 89 cases of 100,000 people had occurred in two years.
what should we do if we suspect damage to our children?

Nigeria: Police raided Kaduna schools and rescued 300 children.
Kaduna - The State Police of Kaduna conducted a forced investigation yesterday at the Imam Ahmad van Humbal School in Rain Maidhuven Tunma, Igabi, arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
Police said the children were inhumane, but the school denied this claim.
Residents calling themselves the school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering the school, parents signed their consent.
Parents come to deliver meals to their children every day, so they know what kind of environment it is.
I was very surprised to have closed the school after the police came and took away the kids and all the food they had delivered to their parents.
Although there are parents who can testify to the terrible environment the police say, this is unfair."
He adds that Abdullahman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what the children were in, but never complained.
It is also said that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhumane environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Pope, warning IT representatives that AI development is based on public interests
On Friday, Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, investors, and others that the competition for artificial intelligence (AI) development and other digital development would increase social injustice if not accompanied by ethical assessments of public interests.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethicists met.
At the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a small number of scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work, as well as the case studies of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and the responses of social media companies during the atrocities.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
However, he warned that if he relied too much on robotics to pursue profits, he could take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advancements cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will go back to a kind of savage state based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to take advantage of the expertise of the participants in the conference to find people who can become future advisors to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.

Real Madrid loaned players Martin Udegor and backed up with a cheerleader.
Martin Udegor showed a surprise support for Michel Oyalsabar.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, breaking the national record for the season and making it the top spot in La Liga.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, Zinedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid were humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, the pressure seemed to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not part of the current plan.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Udegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves, was surprised by Michel Oyalusabal's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martín Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, was dribbling through his opponent's crotch and sent an exquisite pass through the inside of another two players to Oyal Sabal, where he scored the goal by receiving this exact thru ball.

Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid in 2015 at the age of 16, but struggled to demonstrate his reputation.
This young Norwegian, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally developed his own territory.
Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When the lawsuit came in contact, Sharad Powerle's name was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's executive branch (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Ajit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit was reached, Sharad Powerl's name was nowhere.
An executive lawsuit and suspicion that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "only they know how Sharad's name emerged and who referred it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that the truth would be revealed if the executive conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud.
Anna Hazare, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the Joint Bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just weeks before the October 21 Maharashtra parliamentary election.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, declaring that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
NCP called the action by the Executive Bureau a political summary.

The police said in this week that he was stabbed under the left and under the abdomen.
Drov is said to have been a customer at the Musinga Drifkana Motorsports event on Saturday evening.

Stop the mistake of stepping on the accelerator pedal!
Four Advanced Supplies - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driver error.
The number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistakes by elderly drivers is increasing.
In particular, when it comes to a sudden departure, it becomes a panic, and the accelerator continues to step on the brake pedal.
A new car equipped with a safety driver support function to cover such a driver error is introduced, but there is also a rearing device that can be attached to an unattended car.
After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform you of pedal mistakes from a new perspective.
It is to avoid pedal mistakes with "an alarm sound."
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping, the acceleration is avoided.
It is difficult to understand changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who can be easily heard.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is affordable, and it is also attractive that you need to set up.
[Ashimo Watching-kun] The World Wing started selling in mid-September with the Ashimo Watch-Do-kun, an accelerator and brake step prevention device.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without moving forward.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is stepped rapidly, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress sudden departure.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I did not tell the signal from the accelerator and instantly controlled the start by turning it into a creep running state (the brake is removed in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h or more at the time of retreat (back) and force the vehicle to be cleaned.
Installation is possible only with a couplerion and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

"Haguhagu" (Representative of Tomoko Tanaka), a support group for raising children in Shiraishi Town, opened a discussion on the experiences and lessons learned from the heavy rain disaster in Saga at Ariake Public House in Sakata, town on July 27.
About 20 mothers who are raising children think about the form of disaster prevention suitable for each family and summarize their awareness and requests for local governments.
Saori Kusumoto (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked the nursery school suddenly lost their desire to go to the nursery school after the flood, and they began to stay overnight.
"It's because adults were busy cleaning up their homes and didn't have enough time to face them," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can not panic and say, "It's okay."
Yukari Ogushi (36) of Shiraishi Town spent a night at the evacuation shelter town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
He said, "If you have a child who can't stay still, you will use your mind around you."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was watered around her house.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the event of a disaster with food and simple toilets.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation will change in the situation of family composition and residence."
Shinako Kawasaki (40) in Shiroishi town, with a child of 6 years and 8 years old, proposed that " elementary school had a closed school e-mail the previous day, but the nursery school had no communication network or mail system.
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "the last time was okay."I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
President Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Arcuri Contact the police agency
The IOPC will examine whether Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the alleged misconduct of the Mayor of London in violation of the Penal Code.
The Greater London Administration (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts of conduct" on suspicion that Mr. Arcuri had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists in the presence of information that indicates the possibility of a crime being committed," says GLA.
This was never proven.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations made by the English and Welsh police.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the Chief of Police at that time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information about his relationship with Arcuri, while claiming that he was "unconfirmed."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but the press said that the Americans who emigrated to London seven years ago had received preferential treatment from the mayor of London for £126,000 from public money and three times to participate in foreign trade delegations with Johnson.
Since then, the government has frozen a £100,000 grant to the hacker house, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked questions puzzled about the investigation process before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British telephone number.
However, according to a number of reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arcuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessman was "public secret among the staff."
The GLA's move to entrust the Prime Minister to the police authorities touched the anger of the Prime Minister's office.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence on any charges, and the prime minister has not been given an opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority prior to the press release issued late on Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will see the political kyogen created by the amasama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the friendship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division, was "public secret."
The former staff of London & Partners (L&P) said that despite some who considered the company "untrustworthy" at that time, Arcuri was privileged to accompany him to a foreign trade-related meeting led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo!
Mr. Ryu Sawagami (photo), President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, asked me about the future prospects.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back on the past 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the 20-year history.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the people involved, not to the history that has been achieved solely by the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing it for 20 years.
If the general public is relieved from the anxiety of money, the world will become brighter from the foundation, and we are working hard every day as a whole.
In the long term, operations do not yield results unless they walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges like the Lehman shock and the bursting of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
We believe that this was the reason why we became a long-term fund for 20 years and that we continued to be a direct sales system that delivered messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
Generally speaking, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc. miller's death, the third drug arrester, the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in drug overdose last year.
According to court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had previously accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl before dying, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying the drug to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold the drug to Miller.
According to a court record released on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Levis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petitt as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutors in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the start of the trial because of the high likelihood of a foreign escape.
There was no immediate reply to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram and published a song titled "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died related to opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died of drug overdose in 2016 and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen rather than Steven.
over 30 mobile games developed by nineyearolds in nigeria
These nine-year-olds are using a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create hide-and-do games.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime, and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats that come out of hiding places.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that he was spending time building games when he was bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children like Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was too obsessed with the game, so I was a bit angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but what about making games myself so that others can play it?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil, who wants to become a scientist in the future, gives the game its name as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it comes to African innovation, young people like Basil take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded the award by creating robots that use program code to isolate housework.
In May, Akrobo won the 2019 Robofest Contest, a girls' high school team from Ghana who programmed boxed robots.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil and his children are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely accused federal agents of corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the federal court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of a plea deal and signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware of false statements against FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the factual document does not specify which sin Hayes admits.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecutor sued former Congressman Hayes for involvement in the plan of the insurance company's senior executive to fund the state's election.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh, founder of insurance and investment companies, has donated over $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016, and has become the state's top political donor in recent years.
Lindbergh supported Republican ideas and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked him to comment by email on Friday, but he did not reply.
On Friday, Hayes' Defendant Carns Davis also received an email asking for additional comments, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken with Cosey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a fact-based document, Hayes actually spoke with the State Insurance Supervisor about a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecutor said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cosey, and spoke directly with the supervisor.
The indictment, published in April, claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to hold up to $2 million for Cosey's 2020 reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported the alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped establish the case.
Cozy has no suspicions.
The indictment described in a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cosey that Lindbergh co-owners instructed Hayes to send $2.5 million to Cosey's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially refuted that he would pay attention if he did so much money, but was eventually broken in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an email asking for more information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's happiness, like! number hidden test plan
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of well-being, some users seem to soon like others' posts!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, makes it an individual and only posts can be seen.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia policy director Mia Garrick said the change was based on feedback from mental health professionals who would consider the number of happy surveys and likes to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garlic said, "We had very positive feedback from a number of affiliated bullying groups and mental health organizations."
It only removes numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchange rather than the number of likes and reactions.
Garlic said it is expected that users will be able to share the platform with more confidence than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights they had access to.
It is very early to say that the test was conducted in countries such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test will end or change.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experiences, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has very aggressive "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram users.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!
One day, I got my mother's favorite bag fittings and I couldn't move anywhere.
If the fittings of your favorite bag are broken, I want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was the handcrafted parts of Cando that helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying i'm not selling anymore
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petitpla product.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main body greatly exceeded.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this fitting.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando for a bad time, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
Originally it is a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
It was planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle, and I bought two pieces.
The size of the ring is small, but if you line it up with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is a quick installation.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So, I decided to make a ring in two pairs.
The metal fittings were increased, but the weight was not a problem at all because of the lightweight parts.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts has increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, the express train of National Railways, is a temporary train, Hiroshima-Kumamoto, a 10-hour trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train with the image of the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
People who enjoy a special train trip inspired by the express 'Aso' of the JNR era
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th with the image of the express 'Aso' during the JNR era.
On the morning of the same day, about 240 people, including railway fans, boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train that connected Kumamoto and Tokyo between 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days) and was organized by Japanese travel as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies.
The trains are made up of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and run on the Sanyo, Chikuho and Kagoshima lines.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother was sentenced to life imprisonment for the honor murder of kandir burochi, a Pakistani social media star.
Candir Barochi, who gained fame with photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, Kandir Baroch, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted on Friday for his sister's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with the most popular "honorary murder" in Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by Balochi, who was famous for his selfie photography - not as big as Western standards, but was provocative in Pakistan, where women were very strong.
His older brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
His brother said in a press conference a few days later that he had killed his sister, "Of course," and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Sardar Mayod, his lawyer, told AFP that the court of the eastern city of Murtan convicted and sentenced him to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar (the servant of God) will be innocent in the Supreme Court," the lawyer said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"My son has no sin.
My daughter and my son."
Barochi's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of neglecting the rules of father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, are rekindled to seek action against the so-called "honorary murder."
Women have been burned, killed, stabbed or strangled by crimes such as choosing their own marriage partner - in Barochi's case, praising their sexuality and embarrassing their family.
The killing is usually done by relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisas (murder reward) and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow perpetrators to be pardoned from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, it is up to the judge's discretion whether murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, his parents changed their minds and asked him to forgive him.
With international hatred for murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
It became critical and threatening, but it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the new heavens were opened in a country where expressing oneself as a presence like Kim Kardashian is considered a bold political activity to improve the status of women.
The roots of "honorary" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

(From left) ASA Amami Sports Academy
[Okinaga Ryobu Sokyoku] The NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda and Amami City) and the Okinaga Ryobu Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda and Chinamachi) signed a partnership for the promotion of remote island sports on February 25.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects conducted by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injuries, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both organizations mediate, send and share information about their trainers and instructors when training related to sports.
When the remote island team is traveling outside the island, they will work to solve problems such as the difficulty of the trainer in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association of Kagoshima Prefecture, which is affiliated with the ASA, during tournaments on the mainland, such as prefectural tournaments, support is provided to prevent the performance of the players from falling due to fatigue during boat trips and consecutive nights.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players who come from outside the island by cooperating with local orthopedic hospitals and hospitals.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Elabko in Chimei-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.

Mr. Maeda (43) said, "It is very encouraging to have a partnership with a proven organization like ASA, and if you want to absorb good things to improve the sports environment for children on remote islands," he said.
Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Mr. Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko adheres to the conventional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool guy.
if you're bound by what you should do
In the first part, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and people's behavior because "coolness" constantly evolves.
When I learn patterns, I think that in this case the brain systematizes the behavior, so I will be able to live comfortably.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether or not I'm "mote."
So it's easy to live.
I was teaching at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit tough if you're sticking to the old pattern of "a university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will survive.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
In my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible it is in the world, I talked about that very much.
The "weight" and "authority" are things that come out naturally by admitting that person.
It's not that easy.
It is painful to ask around me.
I don't know what you were doing at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he is light, he will be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a proven track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by the "thinkness," you cannot be light.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of position or age, it seems that any man "cute" will be a pardon and salvation.
It is difficult to say what this "cute" is.
what is it?
Nigeria's illegal northwest, doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's Friday announcement, in the last four months, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 due to intensified violence.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, it is necessary to cooperate with each institution to raise funds for $35.5 million.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist organization that has been working on anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina in Nigeria over the past decade was caused by organized armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barok said on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, assault, murder and sexual violence were frequent, and raiders destroyed homes and worked on theft.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime groups in the area.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoharam and the West African branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," says Balok.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.

The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising for header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their needs.
The Service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a mechanism that allows media companies to prioritize ads with high unit price by conducting fair bidding competition with multiple bidders.
It has been introduced mainly by major media as a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability.
In the past, SSP has been providing advertising frames through SSP.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers to deliver to specific advertising frames that have high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images, LFP began in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase advertising frames to meet the needs of advertisers.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP header binding allows them to participate in bidding directly for header binding target ad frames, and it is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, because the target media company is limited, the advertisement frame of the distribution company according to individual commercial materials and brand image is secured, preventing damage to brand value.
One of the advantages of media companies is that LFP's "wrapper solution," a solution that bundles and manages the code of each Vidder company, can be implemented in accordance with the wishes of media companies.

Cabinet Revolts Call Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and make compromises with the EU The Sun
Now that only three weeks have passed since the EU summit, there is a growing concern around the Prime Minister that the prime minister may be out of time to withdraw significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet revolt that calls for a reduction in the demands of withdrawal from the EU and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system to replace the Irish border-related backstop clauses have been jammed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtain led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel will propose a compromise proposal on the ground, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They will demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings, and insist that the EU will accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One Cabinet member said that the Supreme Court's ruling that the closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday would be "a warning."
We will never win in the House and they are against us.
The Prime Minister shall use whatever is available from his steps.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and Cummings' plan is obviously unsuccessful.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to carry out an agreement with former Prime Minister Terryza May if not yet.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are a number of reasons for this, and everyone is trying to end this.
If the delay is inevitable, Boris is over and we are all over.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering the negotiations.
In a harsh speech, the former leader of the Conservative Party said, "The prime minister wants to make an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister fighting bulls in Scotland, inspecting eggs in the Wales, and discussing with the people on the streets - as if the election campaign was full-fledged."
The prime minister's press yesterday acknowledged that the agreement was still a long way ahead, and said, "No one can think of it - if it is to achieve the goal, the road is still long."
However, the press also said that the Ben Bill, which enforces a three-month delay in the event of an unconfirmed withdrawal, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that the bill has hindered our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue moving forward despite the bill's passage."
Stephen Berkeley, Minister of Delegation from the European Union, returned to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by television bosses that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was so nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, said he looked back at 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before I took over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone on the TV-am team and to see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget Ann Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis that morning.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my favorite place is here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Davelake, and later began a program named Lorraine.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, she broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
"Passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity" were the secret to survival in the television industry, and the host added, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
Do what you should do, get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck her heart, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think many of the families of children who were killed or injured watched us broadcast the show live from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, who was killed by her mother and five-year-old daughter Joanna, personally told me that she wanted to see me, so we talked for hours at her house.
Not taking it all on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very hard" and "very respecting the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painful and gloomy web of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga was afraid of traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of a presidential post from former President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to fears that it might be a trap to refute military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, the reason why Chiwenga declined the offer was not because of anxiety, but because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was stripped of his administration in a coup.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirmed that officials were senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who had been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munnagagwa," it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
Mugabe, who realized he was losing power, told the government officials that he had made contact with Chiwenga by messengers.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three persons.
The senior officials said that President Spokesman George Charamba, former deputy head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Nepera, and Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Muconoli were involved in the negotiations.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was one commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to accuse the African Union of military action while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the presidency to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was an abandoned act to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there were a few political aims of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If it were to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President, Mugabe, hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and destroy the claims of the commanders claiming that he did not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the situation, would decide whether it would be a coup, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe was moving when he realized he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the presidential house called Blue Roof, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things: to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
A strong figurative expression was used in the words of a messenger (gono) telling the president's desperate message: "Is Tiri Bemaqwapa Macwapa (we belong to the camouflage group, the military), we are not politicians or political competition."
The Army told other military commanders in the area that through military officers staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coup and successors, Mugabe attempted to bring back Munangagwa, who had been short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed assistance from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the South African Development Community at the time, South Africans, who were key to this process, refused to intervene, but threatened repeatedly behind it, clarifying that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military had invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources tell the Independent.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to ban nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th, a meeting was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.
Five new states ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, including 32 countries and regions.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (ICAN).
Secretary-General Guterres also spoke and expressed strong concern over recent years that there have been moves to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There is no other way to abolish it."
China needs strong leadership.
Prior to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In a white paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will face division and collapse, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified dealing with problems in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratic movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemoration ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, has strengthened the party's control since he took power in late 2012.
Xi also oversaw the modernization program of the military that threatened the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development models, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but rather merely seek peace.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the powerful, and war and confusion left a deep scar with its pain; China would never take the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in Chinese Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "abandon" its core interests and will not allow its security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"The threat of trade wars and rising tariffs are no problem-solving," the White Paper states in relation to trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with the momentum of complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities and opening a new world.
China has no idea of countering the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., so the U.S. should take the development of China calmly.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more unlikely to stop China's development.
The U.S. will not maintain its strength if it suppresses, suppresses, and moves domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Takayoshi dismissed Director Hirata and Director Kaneko. (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced on the 28th that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masashi Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as the coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local newspaper had a rumor about baseball club members.
After hearing the situation from the two students, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of a survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they were dismissed on 28 January because they generally recognized the facts.
Yokohama was defeated by Motochika WATANABE (74) who raised pitchers such as Daisuke MATSUSAKA in the summer of 15.
It was directed by Hirata and headed by Kaneko.
For the third consecutive year from the summer of 16 years, he participated in Koshien in summer, and this spring he also participated in Senbatsu.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals, and the next spring, Senbatsu was desperate.
Spice Girls' Mel C, eating disorders, and eating disorders are prohibited in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom admitted that the family had banned diets from eating any fruit and vegetables for many years.
Sporty spices were later diagnosed with depression and eating disorders as a result of years of "excessive exercise" without eating well under pressure from members of the global pop group.
Chisom told her that her experience was also influenced by her daughter Scarlett's child rearing, stating that "all topics related to diet in the family are prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his appearance," says Mel.
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was able to be very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, still in front of SNS, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that "bad" comments about himself written in the media led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I took out certain food groups, I became obsessed with exercise more and more, and I was too thin," says Mel.
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Same-sex marriage justice judgment The opportunity to broaden diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch made a decision to approve the case in which 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage was established even between same sex.
There are more than 20 countries in which same-sex marriage is allowed, and even within Japan, municipalities such as Sapporo City have a system to certify same-sex partnerships.
The court ruled that the two women were actually married.
It is considered the first judicial decision to recognize legal protection by same-sex couples and is meaningful.
The same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of civil law and family register law.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system to recognize diverse families.
The women lived together for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the United States.
The court ruled that "the reality of marriage between men and women is not the same" based on the results of living together.
It is a revolutionary decision to extend the recognition of actual marriage with the same-sex rights, such as social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of "freedom of marriage" as marriage "only based on the agreement of both sexes."
Both sexes were "unpresumed to be same-sex marriage at the time of establishment, so it is not understood to be the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
While the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the absence of same-sex marriage, the problem remained that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection differ from that of men and women."
It may be difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while recognizing the same reality as men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, about 70 percent of people believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a legal spouse, so there are still few restrictions, such as not receiving preferential treatment in the tax system and not having joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only same-sex marriage but also expanding legal rights for actual marriage.
Trials and jury trials of former athletes prosecuted for rape by multiple women
A jury trial was held for former Delaware University baseball players accused of sexual assault on multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
A 21-year-old woman stated that she was sexually assaulted after sending Conaway home by car.
The two met after three weeks at the meeting site Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault the woman.
The defense argued that women's inconsistencies and differences in memory may have regretted having physical relations.

[Dospo] Ota is the 4th and 20th most self-portrait after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
It became a reward for the seniors.
Four times in one lead, he hit his 20th home run with a liner on the left.
I arrived at the number of home runs that I had been aiming for, "I stopped receiving this number and tried and tried again, and it became a big one."
The director's intention was also firm.
This was the first time a four-part series was released.
He said, "I put it in number four so that I could swing.
Oda responded to the expectations that he "feeled and felt that he had entered the game, and spent a day purely exciting."
One of the ideal 4 statues is Abe, a giant who retired from active duty this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads to victory, and the 4th of the team is the result every day, and the 4th seniors who have seen it with giants were the same."
Among them, "Abe-san's appearance comes to mind the most, he was a reliable existence, and he looked at that back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist destinations
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $209 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, Circler Keys, Luna Park and some famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool each year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the dirtyest places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with shells, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal corpses - all flowing rainwater into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting waterways.
In a video that was accidentally released on September 27, the day of world tourism, Dr. Katherine Dafoon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
Although its appearance is certainly beautiful, it is one of the most polluted estuary of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour is expected to flow into the waterway, most of which flow through rainwater drainage into Sydney Harbour.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but Sydney Harbour was... quite tragic," Dr. Daffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, under the surface of Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastics that flow into the ocean are deposited in the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know the truth about what's there," said the owner Richard Nichols, Dive Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste each year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what's under the water), I think everyone will be really surprised.
Although overwhelming, more than half of the items we discover are plastic bags.
The other half is plastic at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing right under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces the amount of plastic used, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so you have to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30% of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
But we can restore Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, coincided with the release of the video funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of a broader awareness of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also stated that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed were increasingly worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.

This time, Maya Takahashi, a free announcer and commentator on CBC TV "Cant!," spoke about his master.
my mentor's advice to save my rotten self
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a teacher, beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
It's not what I'm doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important as a member of society.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was struck by being said to be a cone or a busaik, my father said, "I thought it was a cone, but it wasn't.
After that, around the second or third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty female anna can do it," and even when I didn't get motivated because I didn't want to do the job I wanted to do, even when my heart was rotten, "Who can do the job is hard to do."If so, I asked Mama to do it, but I was glad to be in charge of it.
i learned naturally from my father's performance.
There may be a lot of people who have never seen me read the news, but since I joined the TV station, I have been in touch with the news all the time with the narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would also come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe was happy and confident that he was "good at reading Mama news."
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sense.
The readings, how to take the breath and how to interact with each other have been cultivated through my father's stage, film, television, and period dramas as a child.
In other words, I think that my father helped me with the various experiences of my childhood.

The host was Mr. Kawamata of the OB association from Miyakojima City and introduced the charm of kumi odori.
In this workshop, I learned about the three components of kumi odori (music, chant, Ryukyu dance) and how five types of musical instruments are represented in dance.
As for the sanshin, it was explained that it was an element of the movement and emotion of the characters along with the songs, and that Kokyu was pulling up the songs and the melody of the sanshin while playing.
In the latter half, the students experienced the sound of the instruments and felt the appeal of the instruments.
The purpose of this initiative is to get familiar with "Ryukyu classical music" through musical instruments and to get interested in "gumi Odori" by many students.This is the first time in Miyako.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18 cards.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020.
The WRC World Rally Championship (WRC) is one of the four World Championships in which the International Automobile Federation (FIA) manages, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, it has become the world's highest rally championship with a history and tradition held every year, and it is said that the competition is the toughest car competition because it runs not only on closed roads (paved roads), but also on various roads such as gravel and snow roads at high speed.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturing Challenger title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparation Committee was established to host the event in Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work with relevant parties to ensure that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in the fall of 2020.
Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japanese round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all at this moment."
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motor Sports, commented on the Japanese round.
The Japan round of the WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City and Shitara Town) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ena City).
The main venue is "Love - Global Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
The Japan Round Invitation Preparatory Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 test event will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is Tasmanian devil the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmanian devils may be the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient care.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells camouflaged.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will create a new method for treating cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy could significantly alter their treatments for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing lethal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and alkalis use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camflageate, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to no longer attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
Peter McCallum researcher Mark Dawson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Traditional treatments may be reused to revitalize markers, or proteins known as MHCs, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat Tasmanian devil's face-to-face tumors, where cancer cells escape detection as well.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process occurs in humans and Tasmanian devils," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may help control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists are surprised by the discovery of a solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-type planets orbit around a small star called red dwarf, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting its main star, the red dwarf was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
In this case, however, the magnitude of stars and planets is not much different, the researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12 percent the size of the Sun, but the planet orbiting around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, led this research published in the journal Science.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only much smaller than our Sun, but also about the same size as the giant planet, about 35 percent larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is quite low as about 3800 degrees Celsius (6380 degrees Celsius/3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I have a red color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining its elliptical orbit.
Planets are produced from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust that produced the star that orbits itself.
In the most powerful planetary formation model called the "core accumulation" model, the object is formed from solid particles in the disk, and the gravity produced by the egg of the planet causes the surrounding gas to become atmospheric.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star may have been slightly larger and less hot than was thought," Morales said.
Since the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense regions may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a bean dip containing a stimulant to his colleagues, indictment.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is accused of having his coworkers eat a dip of beans with a stimulant.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of transferring methane fetamine and taking regulatory drugs to others for Class B felony.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit obtained from OregonLive.com, a colleague of the suspect (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste a bit because he saw Medina Hernandez making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "After eating a few mouths, I thought it tasted strange, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach was getting worse and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have contained methane phetamine in soy dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee told Medina Hernández that he had "druged" the victim's food, while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying that he had accidentally put methane fetamine in the bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Derri shows Medina Hernández turning his camera back and clinginging behind a microwave, but taking something out of the brazier.
After that, he stood up and wiped his nose, walked toward the table and put a dip of beans in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been given contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was detained in Marion County jail instead of bailing at $5.2 million.
According to The Smoking Gunn, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of felony by assault, robbery, spoofing, transfer of methane phetamine, theft, possession of methane phetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "The Challenge Can be organized" President of JR Tokai, attach importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on 27th, Shin Kaneko, President of JR Tokai, reiterated the importance of early construction, stating that "it is better to separate the issues discussed in consultation with Shizuoka Prefecture that should not be organized before starting construction and should be done after starting construction."
More specifically, he said, "We will talk at the meeting and at the front."
President Kaneko said, "When we organize all the problems, it's not easy to start construction, and I think it's possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our thinking, we have to talk to the prefecture."
The prefecture is concerned that the spring water from the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that it would be difficult to think about the safety of the construction, although it would be possible to do it realistically.
He denied that the route change mentioned by Governor Kawakatsu Hirata was "not possible."
President Kaneko pointed out three locations of Minami Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station as places that take a particularly long time for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Administrative and Social News|Saga Shimbun
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced the hospital's name on September 26 as a need for reorganization and integration.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in Japan, and three have already been integrated and relocated.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital in Taramachi, Fujitsu County.
Of these, Takyu City Hospital and Kojo Municipal Hospital are planning to build a new hospital in Higashi Takyu-cho, Takyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating surplus in recent years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi stressed that "the town has the idea of operating alone and cooperating with neighboring city hospitals, and the hospital must remain absolutely for the residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The administrative director of the Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "We do not hear the contents from the prefecture," and concluded that "We will actively participate in the prefectural regional medical planning coordination conference and respond to it based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Organization for Promotion of Regional Medical Functions (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not a mechanical decision to determine the direction of public hospitals, but rather a request to review them again at regional medical planning coordination meetings in each prefecture."
"We would like to hear from the parties about the future operation of the hospital.
In some cases, it may be necessary to review medical subjects and to further reduce the beds."

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise and frequent use of royal aircraft
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use private machines that move royal families around the world for important events and appearances.
Of course, there is a privilege to have a private aircraft.
You don't have to be in line with the long line of entry, there is no limit to the number of baggage, and the Royal Family seems to be able to invite guests, including unexpected passengers, as much as you like.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, only Queen and Prince Philip are frequent customers of royal aircraft.
During the "Royal Flight Secrets" program, the Queen's former flight attendant revealed that many of her hairy guests, along with her family, often ride.
Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, like a very important royal customer, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggie Dog Privileges are famous, and it is not surprising to request a cute pet to travel together.
Queen Elizabeth has been fond of dogs since her childhood, and is said to have kept more than 30 coggie dogs even after she became queen.
In 2007, she had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linette, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, there were five Cockerspaniel vists, oxo, flash, pick, and span, as well as four Daxfunt and Coggie mix dogs cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The staff on the Royal Aircraft will be busy.
The Royal Staff had been seen asking the dogs to leave the lawn before boarding, and Seals continued.
I've never been in an accident.
The show also found that her luggage during her public service trip was known for shocking amounts.
According to the Narrator, "The Queen's luggage was 12 tons during a 44,000-mile Commonwealth tour in 1953."
It can be understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
However, the Queen does not like fashion.
The wife of the Marquis of Cambridge is said to have a unique taste when carrying her own clothes, and in Uwasa, she takes one sheet for each dress.

Trump Hotel owner's suitability complaints, liquor sales license retained.
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Commission dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the liquor license of the local Trump International Hotel, as the owner's suitability was questioned.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three members, two former judges and two Jewish leaders that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on a state law requiring the applicant's "appropriateness" to obtain a liquor license.
In the first appeal filed in the summer of last year, he accused President Trump of assault and repeated fraud, claiming he violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the license was already approved.
This was the second time a petition was issued to update the permit.
The honey collected by Bentley's Flying Bees is the first harvest!
How do you taste honey collected by Flying Bees bred at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September 2019.
More than 100 honey bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the grounds of a factory that assembled cars?
I want to taste this!
The honey produced by Bentley is here (11 sheets)
Peter Bosch, executive officer in the manufacturing department of Bentley, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers have been watching the bees from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains collecting nectar from various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities through its Crew Plant and our business to become the top sustainable luxury car manufacturers, and is also part of this effort.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of bentree honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to carry out various initiatives to fulfill our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million honeybees, Flying Bees, were launched.
In September of the same year, a summer passed, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator, and after filtering the fallen honey, it was bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The design of the label was handled by Louise McCallum, the designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we would like to enjoy afternoon tea together with " Flying Bees" honey in scones and other places.
The Cleveland Police, a series of scandalous reports, is the worst in Britain.
A police officer named him the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
According to Phil Gomley of the Cleveland Police Department, "heavy deterioration" continues.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing a new demand for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley of the Police Directorate said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Police chief Mike Wiel resigned in January less than a year before taking office, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Lieutenant Simon Herwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee for Illegal Practices for the reason that he directed colleagues to do sexual acts.
He resigned from the police.
Conservative Mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Home Affairs intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "Although improvements have been made, I have full responsibility for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a criminal, impeachment has to be settled.
Nobody knows what will happen.
Now we think we're involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate."
"We're going to do a job that we're starting to do based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump commissioned Ukrainian President Vladimir Zerensky to investigate former U.S. President Joe Biden and his son.
According to the call records, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor Rudi Giulani.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was a national security lawyer in the Department of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before the formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of political fund violations.
In response to Barr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee decided to ask who to testify.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the telephone talks with the Ukrainian president in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision on the handling of this accusation.
Pelosi said he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower who was informed that Trump attacked the whistleblower as a spy on Thursday and hinted that he had been treated differently in the past.
The president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president did not say anything about the person who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump on suspicion of putting pressure on foreign leaders for political gain and noted a historic step.
The call was included in a statement released on Thursday, in which the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office in the upcoming 2020 presidential election to "see intervention" in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-grade computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Bentek, speed violation prohibited driving
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, seems to have been banned from driving.
The 28-year-old forward at Crystal Palace confirmed on January 20, that he had driven his Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 speed limit in Richmond, southwest London.
The Belgians then photographed a speed violation camera in Patney, southwest London, driving 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not have to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek pleaded guilty to these two violations under a single trial procedure in which one justice of the peace tried and sentenced him to light crime.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu is concerned about the composition of the judging committee.
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the upcoming GFA elections.
He questioned the inclusion of Frank Davidis, and expressed discontent with it.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu stated that the chairman was interested in the results of the review process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The review committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside who is not related to each member or previously uninterested.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kwak Parma about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that the commission of the jury should not be allowed because he had interests.
Mr. Manu stated that if Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer, Chairman of the Board.
Other members include Reginald Rariair, Marketing and Sales, and Richard Appocavi, a sports director and lawyer.
A survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage to be 1,000 yen.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and only 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded with "approval" to raise the yen to 1,000 yen per hour, including information-related (100 percent), construction (70,6%), and wholesale (61,7%).
The majority of respondents were manufacturers (51 and 9 percent) and service businesses (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink, and lodging.
The representative of the conference said, "Although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with high part-time and hourly wages, there are many companies that think it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs."
The average salary of the companies who answered "the opposite" was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation at the company in March 2007, 61.3% of regular employees hired new graduates, 54.5% mid-term employment, and 15.4% of non-regular employees were employed.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (37.5%, 37.5%) and the construction industry (24.1%, 38.1%) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% had challenges in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for new graduates (returning jobs within three years after graduation) and mid-career recruitment.
There were also opinions to encourage students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied that they have already recognized it.
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total showed acceptance.
64.4% were "not admitted" companies, with construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%), and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiplic said, "It's a show now," when Wales will host the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Wallabeads, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D, and will likely be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory over Wales was the 14th victory, Tiplic and the team would be a straight line for England's best eight races.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to win and finish at the top of the group," said Tipric of Wales.
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last fall.
I think Australia is quite blaming to repay the debt, but until we try to win again.
I knew this game was a mountain before I came here.
And now I'm here, this is the real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Wales has won the third place since 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gutland, all three Southern Hemisphere heavyweight teams won only seven out of 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiplic was one of the few representative members who won 9-6 of the match and played at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
Certainly the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it was impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
The key to Wales' victory is the break-down battle between Australian duo Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Back Law.
Up until now, Tiplic has played 67 international matches, and has played several matches with both players.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you will always know that you will face tough games from now on.
They are always the best in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is an aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when needed.
I want to improve myself by fighting against the world's best players rather than playing against the so strong Bucklow.
I want to fight with the best opponents, and if I play against them, I have to keep up with myself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it is an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose with momentum.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings '90 percent of the gala', would it really be a gift from entertainers?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by the dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
At a press conference on July 22, President Akihiko Okamoto said, "The company has 9 talent, 1 talent, no such thing at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the "9:1" ratio, it would be considered that there were gifts from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and investors' views that taxes would be paid were also tweeted on Twitter.
If the amount of Galla is "9:1," is there a gift tax?
i heard from you.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen is "9:1," the profit of 1 million yen in sales and 100,000 yen in expenses will be 9 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should declare your tax and pay your corporate tax already.
Also, even if you think about the allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a problem in calculating taxes.
However, as in this case, a third party will not be able to decide on how much tax-appropriate prices are for those traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen's payment statement is a pity.
Mr. Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working at a bank, he registered as a tax accountant in 2008 (five subjects: bookkeeping, financial statements, corporate tax law, income tax law, inheritance tax law).
University lecturers, seminars, writing and other activities are broad.
It has a reputation for easy-to-understand explanations for accounting beginners.
the white house, a panic without impeachment.
On Thursday, the White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party, and detailed officials explained that this week there was a "great panic" feeling against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be increasing "confidents, anxiety, and worry" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers would damage the President and some surrounding persons.
He said, "I don't really think it's true."
The White House official joked that there were no obvious plans for the situation, or that the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied, so there was no confidence in how to proceed, as this claim was so serious that it would not seem to be erased from the next news.
Another person familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's uncontrollable response to the impeachment question would increase the likelihood of "uncontrollable."
Another source of concern is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is seen to be raised every day, and some of the close associates of the president are expected to further "impulsive" behavior.
Trump has spurred concerns about the increasingly unpredictable actions and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about the president and politics in the electoral year.
Trump faced the greatest threat he had ever faced during his term of office, and has changed his hands, becoming an attacker, becoming a defense, and reviving the strategy he considered effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Moller.
Trump tried to neglect the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for partisan conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the Mora trials, but this time they are beginning to feel the difference.
The president, whose powers are branded, seemed to be coming to the press conference on Wednesday, said a person familiar with this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have answered questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that damage can be mitigated, claiming that it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information about the calls with President Trump, Vladimir Zerensky, and Ukrainian Presidents, which are controversial.
Furthermore, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic family close to the White House points out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and the impeachment will not have much effect on gaining new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news during the forty-six o'clock period, "there is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President for the next four months."
Another source stated that those claiming impeachment could be the help of the president did not fully understand how uncertain the president's response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from their advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to an official who explained this plan, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented and what kind of actions will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a recognition that a clear leader who can organize public relations activities aggressively is needed to counter organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, and the publication and publication of critical internal accusations against the momentum of Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of a long-term strategic perspective is clearly visible, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Steven Munusin stated that they would not publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later.
It is expected that more pressure will be raised now than Robert Morler's investigation, which he said only through almost inconsistent indictments.According to the person involved, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called Trump's external pitbull, and Corrie Luwandowski, who served as the head of the former electoral ward.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never talked to the president or his close associates about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in Clinton's impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left Pat Cipolon, the current White House legal adviser, with little experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy, in general, noted that officials are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but are aware that they need people who can be organized and lead the collective efforts and political struggle.

Although I had a boyfriend all the time, I had a long distance romance due to his work ...
I was told to marry someday, but I couldn't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation to marriage by side?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice derived from detailed data analysis is mandatory.
what's this?
I am worried about whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during a long distance romance.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I work and my parents live, but his place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, administrative office)
The couple who got married from long distance love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (hereinafter, -) C is in a distant relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested in distance and the two become stronger."
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) Speaking of distance love, the survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touch), smelling (or smelling), kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to your opponent's house, you will be burdened by the time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and your body is still a holiday to heal work fatigue.
I feel refreshed when I go home.
Is that the only way to break apart when it comes to distance?
Morikawa I think it will work if you are a couple who can endure without having to meet frequently or a couple who have a certain period of time in advance.
You'll be engaged a year later, or you'll come back from your transfer two years later.
It may be difficult if you do not see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes blamed the Democratic Party for the Trump nude photo request.
Devin Nunes, a California Republican, seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump will be investigated.
On Thursday, in a comment to defend the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain presidential nude photos.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive at the House of Representatives Information Special Committee, filed in the opening statement of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had requested to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see a naked picture of the President, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special commission negotiated with Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude pictures," he said.
It would be natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the President that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes ended, HuffPost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to find out if the Democrats were looking for the truth.
Only Congressman Jim Heims of the Connecticut Democratic Party has responded so far, but many other members question whether the answer is a red-naked truth.
Mediate.com speculates that Nunes' nudist comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that are said to have been written in a controversial steel document.
It is a notorious report that former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to a "stick tape" in a hotel room in Moscow where Trump is seen watching prostitutes urinate, suggesting existence.
Origami, wallet and real cards.
Money transfer, loan, insurance, investment - Yahoo!
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to pay by Origami Pay, as well as access (moving) through remittances and collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, we will start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing can be used at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and Representative Director of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services that will solve the challenges of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origami ID, you will be able to seamlessly complete your application and transaction, and you will get timely information.
He also explained that by deploying not only the Origami app but also on partner companies' apps, it would be possible to provide services that are available even without the Origami app.
In terms of financing, we introduce the functions that can be used to pay back when making payments.
In addition, when funds were suddenly needed, it was completed on the Origami app from application to repayment.
As for insurance, we introduce Aioi Nissei Insurance and Dai-ichi Life as a partner company.
The two companies will use their data and knowledge to develop insurance products in line with life events.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually through registration of necessary administrative agencies.
New business for effective use of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support effective use of data, including data held by companies, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its own Pay through the payment function provided by Origami.
Origami recognizes that effective utilization of data, such as the acquisition of structured data such as sales and unstructured data in the real world, the accumulation, processing, and analysis of such data, will become a challenge in partner companies that partner with Origami, such as payment and settlement functions.
Among them, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with payment data by its Pay and structured data owned by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.
Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies gather various data to create customer contacts," and explained, "In the next phase, it is important to develop business models using data."
"We want to create innovation in the next phase by combining data from the Origami Network and data from many companies."
Details of specific services will be announced sequentially.
In addition, the Origami Conference 2019 will provide the convenience of Origami's future efforts, such as delivering coupons to smartphones when it rains.
In addition, Origami Pay now provides full compensation for unauthorized use, but it is clarified as a system under terms of use, etc.

The possibility of emission reduction in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks and semis have monopolized the news, they are the only ones flying in the air that can not reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology to make renewable biofuels available as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Sciences, Alberta, launched the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid waste such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology uses low-quality fats for production, 85% less carbon emissions than crude oil-based fuels, and other industrial wastes during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said that the technology achieved (actually generated) in the first generation was hydrocarbons of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline.
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technologies tend to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is something like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low-risk approach that requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that are already partially developed to maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler described the second option as "can be tested with a reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Currently, Foge operates a testing plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, and recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a 25 million US production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce about 19 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate does not increase in fuel transport and production.
"As a technologist," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the above-mentioned decisions.

Boris Johnson warns that if Brexit is over, the UK will face riots like Los Angeles, the prime minister will call for calm.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the outcome of the first referendum, there was a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
The Prime Minister's high-ranking officials warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson said he needed to "quell anger" against the political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but insisted that he would not use the term "defeat."
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain calm, one minister told The Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gilles Joan or the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a look at the yellow vest movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and then a few populist leaders who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when four white police officers beat Rodney King, a black taxi driver, were sentenced to not guilty.
This year, the French anti-government demonstration participant Gire Joan, wearing the eye-catching yellow vest, has caused confusion and destruction in the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people vote in a referendum and 66% vote for those staying in the EU, 10 million people are dissatisfied," the Ministers say.
Even if 99 percent of voters oppose withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people will not give up writing letters to Congress.
It takes less time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of a "strong riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a House of Representatives rebellion calling for lower demands on EU withdrawal and instead to hit the EU with a compromise.

The opening match of Niigata will take place on Saturday, October 5 at Away against Albuquerque Tokyo.
pakistan, brother of social media celebrity, was sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the case fades.
"It's too time-consuming to forget people," said Farzana Bali, a female rights activist and founder of the first gender department at a university in Pakistan, adding that even the case of Barochi, which is attracting attention, took more than three years to solve.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honored murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much more than that, because it is estimated that Pakistan accounts for about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings that are committed by honor-based violence monitoring organizations worldwide every year.

Floods and disruptions caused by prolonged monsoons in many parts of India
The monsoon season in India lasts for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their power at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month is usually 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues for a few days, the monsoon will weaken at the latest decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays destroyed buildings and killed several people.
The houses were flooded, and the inhabitants crossed the street with water on their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Raknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains caused damage to homes.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
For farmers, prolonged monsoons are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mecherer, a small farmhouse in Bimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoon.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dašera on 8 October, where the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, the evil smiling figure of the beard-boom appearing in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, it may be Lavana to laugh at the end.
[Sendai] Defeat Yokohama M with a compact defense Direct Watanabe (Sports News) - Yahoo! News
J1 Begarta Sendai conducted private practice for 24 to 4 consecutive days (open to the press only for 20 minutes at the beginning) for the 28th Battle of Home Yokohama M (at 7 p.m., Utah).
Yokohama M lost 15 points in the last three games of the league, but Shin Watanabe (45) responded by saying, "The players showed me powerful, battle-like exercises."
Last season, he lost eight games in the clubworths at home on July 18, and lost five in the enemy territory.
It is a difficult enemy to lose in 1-2 this season.
Yokohama M, the third-largest city in Sendai, currently ranked 14th, has 48 points in the league.
In addition to strong front-line players such as the 13-point FW Marcos Juniol (26) and the 10-point 7-assisted FW Nakakawa Teruto (27), J's leading CB combination of Japan DF Hatakenaka Makinosuke (24) and Brazilian DF Chiago Multis (24) are also waiting.
Director Watanabe said, "There are plenty of aggressive play in and out, there are speed CBs, we want to protect compact and fight with confidence without seeing any tear."
The Emperor's Cup for the first time was defeated by J2 Nagasaki on the 18th, and only the remaining eight league matches were played.
The commander said, "It was a regrettable loss, and it is now the most important to stand up from there."
It enhances feelings and shows the results of the measures in pitch.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
Current studies have shown that working around high-concentration pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a more than 30 years of follow-up survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii.
Researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent compared to men who did not work around pesticides.
"This research highlights the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides at work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure at work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of the Department of Elderly Care at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this study may not be applied to women or other races, as only Japanese-American men are concerned.
Due to the long half-life of pesticides, health effects may appear years after exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year follow-up study, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said in a press release.
This is probably due to the increased importance of other factors related to aging and the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in later years.
The researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides was not important to heart disease and heart attack.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone talks
The impeachment procedure for U.S. President Donald Trump was a radical week in Washington politics.
For political novice Vladimir Zerensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
But what has been known about the Zelensky-Trump telephone problem, and is there a wide range of influence on Zelensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on specific proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's 1000% argument is controversial.
Zelensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no previous support from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the support including EU sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
Politicians from Ukraine, Victoria Voytica, said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then mocks military aid and asks Zerensky to investigate two rather than one, one against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is an investigation on the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hinder European relations or lay backwater against French and German leaders.
I don't want to complain about anyone.
"We thank the people who helped us with the announcement of the call record," Zerensky said at the New York General Assembly.
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The award was awarded to Ghana for provisional implementation of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification survey (ICVM) on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Aviation Organization's World Safety Audit Report.
The safety award was recognized by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO on safety at airports and national airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's delayed national zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for security evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was awarded to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director General of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Nii Icoi Otou, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada, and Yau Kuwakwa, Director of Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, President Olmiwa Bennard Aliou stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to continue to be aware that aviation safety, security, and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada said the award was a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the sector's indomitable efforts and perseverance.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a tremendous potential to develop the domestic economy as "air is likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump appoints Peter Gino as FEMA Chief: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Court at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
FEMA's deputy director, Gino, was in the position of deputy director to oversee government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been vacant since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, determined that Mr. Long had illegally used government-owned vehicles to commute between Washington and his home, Norcarorina, and resigned.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baiard, raised doubts about drunkenness and involvement in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of this month after consideration.
Mr. Gino's appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he was on duty at the Emergency Management Department in Rhode Island and was a naval soldier.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down San Gabriel Valley's illegal marijuana baying business.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying activities in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant on suspicion of selling illegal marijuana pen-type beeps, care began at 4:37 p.m. and a large container of betanhanie oil was found in an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found equipment to pack the beep cartridge.
"This process is very dangerous," said Cano.
Lieutenant Cano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigations and that there was a possibility of a fire in the process of extracting oil used in the beep products.
"The static electricity from clothes can only be ignited, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," says Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by fire one after another.
The dangerous goods processing team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately disclosed.
An anonymous information was received and it led to an investigation warrant on the site that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still trying to figure out who the illegal burp activity is.
The police said that Zhang himself believed that the office had a store in the office because the office was empty.
As the investigation continued, police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to prevent illegal bating products from appearing again.
"I don't know if it's real or what I'm buying."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great deal of harm to our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
During the concert, there was a huge earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6!
Evacuation training at Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
In anticipation of an earthquake in the middle of the concert, a practical evacuation drill was held at a hall in Miyazaki City.
This training is held every year.
On stage, a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department is performed, and it is assumed that an earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6 is occurring along the way of the song.
About 300 people attended the training on the 27th, including kindergarten children, local residents, and hall staff.

List of lost dresses by Elizabeth I in Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver foil yarn, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, animals and butterflies was fluffy.
Elery Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, is determined to be one.
Lin saw this faded piece of cloth on the wall of a small church in one rural area, which was placed 100 years ago, and is considered to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally found this luxurious cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly the room where the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
The only remaining dress in the 16th century was a single one, which proved to be an important discovery throughout the Royal Dress Collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence that Elizabeth passed the sleeves to the dress, three years of research raised the conviction of experts that the dress was not part of the royal possession.
The exquisitely expensive textile "cloth made of silver thread" was provided by law only to senior members of the royal family, but the embroidery of plants and flowers of the "name" quality also suggests that the later additions of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears were noble figures.
It is believed that the dress was equivalent to a Tudor mansion when it was made.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace and could not stand up against rivalries wearing such luxury clothing.
Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
I was always very happy to see the cloth and say, "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of a piece of dress used as an altarpiece of the unmarked Baxton Church of St. Faith seems unexpected but not so much.
Baxton is a village from Blanche Parley, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley before Elizabeth died in 1603.
Over 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on very delicate sewing, will be displayed next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and led by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you're really impressed by the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the front and back, you will find a very big respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched for"One week after missing girls, the Self-Defense Force withdraws Volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 days to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces sent a total of 650 people to places with high risk such as mountain slopes and saws, but they could not find clues.
Also, on the 27th, the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search disappeared, and the search was not found.
The police and fire department will continue to search from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral argument of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
As a result of the appeal, the Plaintiff appealed for election invalidation, with only 0.71 votes in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 votes in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of votes per member of the House of Representatives was the lowest in Japan in July.
In the first oral argument held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendant's side requested the dismissal of the claim as "it should not be said that the issue of unconstitution was in a significant inequality, but should be constitutional."
The judgment will be passed on October 30.

The robot arm of the station is growing from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori 8 and applauded JAXA officials on 28th (JAXA provided)
The spacecraft Konotori 8 (JAXA) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which carries supplies to the International Space Station at an altitude of about 400 kilometers, arrived near the station on the night of 28th.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture and gradually advanced through the control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the difference in speed and approaches to a distance of about 10 meters.
The robot arm, 17 and 6 meters long, grabs the supply machine.
The aircraft had about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching it to the station, the airmen carry the luggage.
Mexican drug cartel executive, one third of the drug in the United States
Chicago Shortly after the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News caught rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of overdose.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named Nemecio Cervantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Matthew Donahew DEA executive officer in Mexico said, "Mencho is the DEA and, indeed, the top priority of the U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva Henneración (CJNG), is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "massive" cocaine, methane phetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He began a violent drug cartels.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From the death of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho has not been punished and has defended his empire.
In recent years, thousands of murders have been caused by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the confiscated Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing when handled.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is marked by a smuggler.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the influx of harmful substances that effectively take away the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Tennoji Zoo (Tennoji Ward, Osaka City) held a farewell party for the male koala "ARK," which is the only male breed in Osaka Prefecture.
In mid-October, it was decided to rent a zoo in the UK for 10 years, and it is likely that it will not return.
thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of Koala, where eucalyptus grows, spared their part.
He is 12 years old.
Coala's life expectancy is 15 to 20 years, and it is thought that he will complete Tenju in the UK, where he is married.
Mr. Hideki Tsujimoto (40), the keeper in charge, cried out, "It's hard to put the curtain down on the rearing of the koala.
Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the old days
Sony revealed the PS4 limited version of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of its sequel, Last of As, February 2020.
Some of the video games of this new action game were presented to fans.
More details were published a few days after the Last of As2 news.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
Since the PS1 era, the Last of As Part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"The story is grand and complicated in a different way than the previous one," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell stories with so many characters.
I didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but it eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but it was actually the beginning and realized that all the other sections started."
The game was very large and did not enter a single Blu-ray, but two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are difficult to open at work.
There is no need to ruin this surprise, but Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic Notic Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently released the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
MLB The Show 19 will also be released in October for PS Plus members.
If the Last of As Remastered likes and wants to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replicas, and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Save" Council Trial Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, mobile sales began by the Notoshima Regional Development Council, which was created by residents.
During the trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings, and food crossed the Somachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
There were also products that were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and residents said that it was fun to choose goods.
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even elderly people who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiro gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Susomachi-kai, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mitsue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
The user also ordered "not canned coffee, but also drip coffee."
The council will consider what was requested.
There is currently only one convenience store in Notoshima where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to help "shopping weak."
Until December, the 20 town councils on the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to provide additional $100 million to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been significantly revised to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be allocated to drought-stricken residents' support organizations, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to 100 million dollars of drought relief money for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted more than $7 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Steven, Katie Stay, and four of his five children.
Haskell said on July 9, 2014, he was pushed into the house of Stay and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister Katie Stie.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department announced that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), thirteen and four-year-old son, nine and seven-year-old daughter had died.
Only one person in his family, the 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed until Monday's trial.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of the girl who shook her anger resonated with the leaders of other countries.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and irritability protested all over the world, including Japan.
It is estimated that about 4 million people participated in more than 150 countries.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to 1-5 degrees.
All participating countries shall take measures in accordance with each other without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is pointed out to be related to global warming.
In order to achieve global warming at a fast pace, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit held by Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations, which strengthened the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal to virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their immediate target.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new targets, and the sluggishness in the movement of the emission powers has become conspicuous.
Japan's strong criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy includes zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, Minister of the Environment, presented Japan's efforts at environmental-related meetings, at a conference on climate change, saying, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The uncontroversial scars are nothing more than the "replacement of issues" that the person himself counters.
There is no longer a grace to deal with global warming, and the international community has to deal with the common crisis of humanity.
It would not be effective enough if there were deviations in the efforts of each country.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is adults who should act so as not to take away the future.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The research results of the United States Army led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and time-keeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Distributed Quantum Information Center of the Army Research Laboratory of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Innsbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and one is measured, even if one quantum bit is physically far from the other, the measurement results are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is twice as large as the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, which published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distance.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum internet.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gamble, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
The enthanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and at the same time excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nm, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Dr. Lañon.
In his team, he first sent light particles through non-linear crystals with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nm, the optimal value of long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
In the measurement results, atoms and photoparticles remained entangled despite their long distance travel after converting wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of entangled networks in long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle Clock Network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate position measurement, navigation and time-keeping applications," said Frederick Fatemi, another Army researcher who co-operated the program.
