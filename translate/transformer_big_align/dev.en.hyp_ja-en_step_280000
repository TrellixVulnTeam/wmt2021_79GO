Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina to protest the Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators gathered in the town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the barracks in Trugovska Gola and to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote "Don't take away a healthy future" and "We need a hard-to-stop river," said the nuclear waste disposal facility could threaten the lives of about 250,000 residents in the Una and surrounding areas.
We must oppose it.
The head of the municipality of Novi Grad, Miloslav Driaka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities next week.
Croatian state broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or to pay for the waste of Croatia processed in newly constructed facilities.
Croatian Minister of Environmental and Energy Tomislav Chorich told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a full solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another site on its own near the nuclear power plant.
"Why is the pocket of Bosnian trousers, that is, Turkovska Gola, the best place in Croatia?"

Reducing up to 5% to reduce the cooling of consumption is a "cashless" condition.
[See in the image] Just before the tax increase ... shops and businesses "cacheless introduction"
So what's happening now is "initial introduction."
This is a cashless store that was previously a cash business.
We were close to the installation site.
■ Start-up introduction just before the tax hike "Cashlessization" rushes both shops and businesses.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular shop operated by Takeshin Seika, and there are more than 100 kinds of Okakiya-arashi in the store.
Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users, visited Tatsushin on this day.
PayPay Yasuda: "Is there any payment method other than cash now?"
President Shinmi Takeyoshi: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I think it's easier than cash if you get used to it because it won't be possible to receive a tsurisen.
To date, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce 20% of the total usage by points.
Mr. Yasuda is an "employee man" who sells the introduction of PayPay to customers.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also listened to Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's peak now.If you can't talk to me before you dive into the store, or if you can do a consumer return business together, I'm going to ask you about it with PayPay.
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the country's consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves in the country's "consumer reduction business."

As in "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before the tax hike.

What is the representative Münchhausen syndrome that appeared in The Politician of Netflix?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are ill.
The Politician is broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, the president of the United States, but it is the first step to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinnes Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, even though the person under their protection is not seriously ill.
There are many different types of disease, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is falsely believed to be a disease of himself.
However, the surrogate Münchhausen syndrome implies that others who are clearly under their protection are ill.
It is also known as FII or FII, a type of child abuse.
It is a rare symptom, but usually parents exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if a child is ill.
So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary according to the case-by-case scenario, but NHS points out the following caution.
The child seems to be healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to persuade the medical person to lie down.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make the child feel sick, such as by mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Excessive medications and other drugs can cause symptoms of disease.
How common is the proxy Munchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.
what should we do if we suspect child damage?
Ask local social welfare agencies or call NSPCC Child Protection Helpline 0808 800 5000.

Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police conducted a forced investigation yesterday at the Imam Ahmad ibn Humbal School in Rain Maidhuven Tunma, under the jurisdiction of Igabi, arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
Police said that the children were inhumane, but the school denied this claim.
Residents calling themselves the school's pastor, Chef, said, "All children are in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering the school, parents signed their consent.
Parents came to deliver meals to their children every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were in.
I was very surprised to have closed the school after the police came and evacuated the children, and all the food the parents delivered left.
There are parents who can testify to the terrible environment the police say, "This is unfair treatment."
He adds that Abdullahman, former head of the Police Agency, had visited once to confirm what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
They also say that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhuman environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So we are investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage gully suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind to the bush while attending a school in Central Coast, Kentucky.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to wood and sexually assaulted her.
Immediately after the arrest, a house search warrant was issued and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, the man was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges of assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking along the path and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and a knife suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl asks, "Don't, don't, don't."
The man said to the girl, "Don't speak loud.
He said, "If you don't mind, you'll have to do it."
The man had a knife on his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with a cable tie, then struck the tree and abused it for nearly an hour.

The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development is based on public interests and warns IT representatives.
On Friday, Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors that the competition for artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital development would increase social injustice if not accompanied by ethical assessments of public interests.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
At the conference titled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work, and examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and the response of social media companies during the atrocities were also examined.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
The Pope warned, "If technology advances cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not true progress."
If the so-called technological advances of humans are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will go back to a certain kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to take advantage of the expertise of the participants in the conference to find the future advisers of the Catholic Church on the high-tech field.

Martin Udegor was surprised by Michel Oyalsabar's preemptive support.
Real Madrid won Ossana at 2-0, breaking the national record for the season and making it the top spot in La Liga.
However, this season, despite not losing one game at La Liga, director Genedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to a fierce open battle and a public disagreement with Welsh star Gareth Bale.

Anna Hazale, the name of Sharad Powerl was surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When the lawsuit came in contact, Sharad Powerle's name was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The investigative agency's Executive Office (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Ajit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit was reached, Sharad Powerl's name was nowhere.
The executive's lawsuits and suspicions of Sharad Powerl being involved in the fraud were questioned, and Anna Hazale said Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name emerged and who referred it."
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this incident."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the joint bank, and questioned the timing of filing a lawsuit just weeks before the October 21 Maharashtra parliamentary election.
The former coalition minister clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India and declared that he would not surrender before the "kingdom" of Delhi.
The NCP called the action by the Executive Bureau a political summary.

On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it had classified epipens as generics in the Medicaid drug rebate program.

Stop the mistake of stepping on the accelerator pedal!
Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driver error.
Among them, the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistakes by elderly drivers has been increasing.
Especially when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes panic, and it may be that the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
There are new vehicles equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such errors, but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended vehicles.
After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and it goes on at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform you of pedal mistakes from a new perspective.
It is to avoid pedal mistakes with "an alarm sound."
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping, the acceleration is avoided.
It is difficult to understand changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who can hear easily.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is affordable, and it is also attractive that you need to set up.
[Ashimo Watching-kun] The World Wing started selling in mid-September with the Ashimo Watch-Do-kun, an accelerator brake step prevention device.
It can also be used when retreating (back) without moving forward.
When the accelerator pedal is trampled sharply at the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, do not tell the signal from the accelerator, and control the sudden departure by instantly turning it into a creep running state (removing the brake in the D range).
It is also equipped with a function to detect the vehicle speed of about 5Km/h or more at the time of retreat (back) and force the vehicle to be cleaned up.
Installation is possible only with a couplerion and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Minister Dawa, who first participated in the tour, met with Mayor Yoshiichiro Nakamura at the city hall, and said, "Japan's technology is advancing in the world, and we want to promote initiatives not only in Timi but also throughout the country," and asked for exchanges in view of sister city partnerships.
Mayor Nakamura said, "I'm surprised that I haven't been to the whole Toba citizen yet, and I want to continue my exchanges of mind."
[Saga torrential rains] Sharing mothers' experiences while raising children | Saga News
"Haguhagu" (Representative of Tomoko Tanaka), a support group for raising children in Shiraishi-cho, opened a discussion on the experiences and lessons learned from the heavy rain disaster in Saga at Ariake Public Hall in Sakata, town on July 27.
About 20 mothers who are raising children think about the form of disaster prevention suitable for each family and summarize their awareness and requests for local governments.
Mr. Saori Kusumoto (32) of Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked nursery school suddenly lost their desire to go to nursery school after the flood, and they began to stay overnight.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up the house and have not had enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can not panic and say "OK" to children.
Yukari Ogushi (36) of Shiraishi Town spent a night at the evacuation shelter town hall with four families including three-year-old children.
He said, "If you have a child who can't stay still, you will use your mind around you."
The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he said, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the event of a disaster and have food and a simple toilet.
"There is no right answer to prepare, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Shinako Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a child of 6 and 8 years old, proposed that "the elementary school had a closed school e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or email system, so we could have a uniform email sending system."
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "the last time was okay."I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
TANAKA said, "I think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as a group."
Relations between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri Contact the police supervisory authority.
The Police Directorate (IOPC) will examine whether Prime Minister Johnson should investigate whether scandals during his tenure as Mayor of London violate criminal law.
The Greater London Administration (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts of action" on suspicion of having received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists if there is information that indicates that a crime may have been committed," says GLA.
This was never proven.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was addressed to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations made by the English and Welsh police.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was in a position comparable to the Chief of Police at the time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, despite claiming that he was "unconvinced."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but reports suggest that U.S. citizens who had moved to London seven years ago were given preferential treatment to Mr. Johnson, who paid £126,000 from public money during the mayor's time in London, and joined three foreign trade delegations with Mr. Johnson.
The government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to Hacker House, a company under investigation by Mr. Arcuri.
The company will be asked questions puzzled about the survey process done before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper assessment" and that the company owns a British telephone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone numbering was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arcuri (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businesswoman was "public secret among the staff."
The GLA's move to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory authority touched the anger of the Prime Minister's official residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack" and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence on any charges, and the prime minister has not been given the opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority prior to the press announcement issued late Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will see the political kyogen created by the amasama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Tourism and Regional Promotion Division, was "public secret."
The former staff of London & Partners (L&P) stated that despite some who believed that the company was "untrustworthy" at that time, Arcuri had the privilege of accompanying foreign trade talks led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
The 20th Anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo!
Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, asked him about his future prospects.
The Sawakami Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the 20 years history.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the people involved, not to the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property for general consumers."
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public is relieved from the anxiety of money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operations do not yield results unless they walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result is a 20-year long-term long-term fund and we believe it is because we continue to be a direct sales system that can deliver messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
Generally speaking, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mack miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - The third man was arrested and charged with drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller of overdose of drugs last year.
According to court records, Stephen Walter was charged with selling fake tablets of oxycodon containing fentanil, which Mr. Miller had previously held before he accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fentanil and died last September.
Walter is charged with supplying the drug to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold the drug to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Libbis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in detention, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutors in charge of the case reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday called for Walter to be detained until the start of the trial because of the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram, and released a song titled "Suncue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with recent opioid drug abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died in 2016 due to overdose of drugs and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen rather than Steven.
Development of more than 30 mobile games for nineyearolds in Nigeria
The nine-year-old is using a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hide-and-do game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime, and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats that come out of hiding places.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that he spent time building games when he was bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children like Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry," his father said.
I was frustrated and said, "I'm always playing games, but what about making games myself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care about it."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make the game.
Basil-chan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, gives the game its name as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The youth population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is achieved, young people like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded the award by creating a robot that uses program code to organize housework.
In May, Akrobo, a female high school team from Ghana, who programmed boxed robots, won the 2019 Robofest Contest.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil-chan and his children are trying to become future programming stars.
former president of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely accused federal agents of corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the federal court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a fact-based document prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes' attorney, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which criminal charges Hayes admit.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecution sued former Congressman Hayes for involvement in the insurance company's plan to fund the state's insurance director's campaign.
Major Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated over $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindbergh supported Republican ideas and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer called for a comment on Friday and email, but did not respond.
On Friday, Hayes' Defendant Carns Davis also received an email asking for additional comments, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken to Cosey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a factual document, Hayes actually spoke with the State Insurance Supervisor about a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh to the Department of Insurance.
The prosecution also said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cosey, and discussed direct bribes with the supervisor.
The indictment published in April claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to hold up to $2 million for Cosey's 2020 reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy was involved in a request for replacement of officials who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported the alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped establish the case.
Cozy has no suspicions.
The indictment states that in a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cosey, Lindbergh's co-owner instructed Hayes to send $2.5 million to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially refuted that he would pay attention if he did so much money, but was eventually broken in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an email asking for further information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's happiness, like! number hidden test plan
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users seem to soon like others' posts!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, makes Good! an individual and only Posters appear.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy director Mia Garrick said that the change was based on feedback from mental health professionals who would consider the number of happy surveys and goodies to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had a very positive feedback from a number of affiliated bullying groups and mental health organizations."
It only removes numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchanges rather than the number of likes and reactions.
Garrick said it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more securely than they feel competitive.
Garrick declared that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test has been conducted.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when this test ends or changes.
"There was initially positive feedback on the experience in Instagram, but now it's a stage of listening and learning to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has very aggressive "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram users.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If the fittings of your favorite bag are broken, I want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was the handcrafted parts of Candu that helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying i'm not selling anymore
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pla goods.
Therefore, if you ask the store for repairs, the price of the main unit was significantly higher.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver color.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Candu, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
Originally it is a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
We planned to use one at each end of the bag handle and bought two items.
The size of the ring is small, but if you line it up with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is attached immediately.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The number of fittings increased, but because of the lightweight parts, there is no problem with weight at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of exciting parts increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, the express train of National Railways, is a temporary train in Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours journey | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a special train inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28 days
People who enjoy a special train trip inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
On the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded 12 blue passenger cars from Hiroshima Station and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train that connected Kumamoto and Tokyo between 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, the tour was organized by Japanese travelers.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs the Sanyo, Chikuho and Kagoshima lines.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother was sentenced to life in prison for the honor murder of kandir barochi, a Pakistani social media star.
Candir Barochi, who gained fame with photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
His brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment with "honorary murder" which attracted the most attention of his patriarchal Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by Balochi, who was famous for his self-portraits, which were not as big as Western standards, but were provocative in Pakistan, where women were very strong.
His older brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
He said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, of course, that his sister's actions were "unforgivable" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of the eastern city of Murtan was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshira (God's calling) will be acquitted in the Supreme Court," the lawyer said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar My, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Baroch's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of neglecting the rules of his father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, are rekindled to seek action against the so-called "honorary murder."
Women have been burned, killed, stabbed or strangled by crimes such as choosing their own marriage partner - in Barroch's case, praising their sexuality and humiliating their family.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisas (murder reward) and Deya (retaliatory) laws allow perpetrators to be forgiven from their relatives.
Three months after Baroch's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, it is left to the judge's discretion whether murder is an honorable crime, and the murderer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, his parents, who were sad about losing his son, changed their minds and told him to forgive him.
In response to international hatred of murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barroche's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a bright red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
It became critical and threatening, but it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the expression of oneself as an existence such as Kim Kardashian opened a new heaven and earth in a country considered to be a bold and political activity to improve the status of women.
The origins of "priority" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

[Okinagarabe General Bureau] The NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda and Amami City) and the Okinagara Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda and China Town) signed a partnership to support the promotion of remote island sports on February 25.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects implemented by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish mutual support systems in terms of health management and prevention of injuries, such as when children from remote islands visit the island.
Both organizations mediate, dispatch and share information about their trainers and instructors when training related to sports.
When a remote island team goes to a tournament outside the island, they will work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated incorporated association with the ASA, in order to prevent the performance of the athletes from falling due to fatigue during boat trips and consecutive nights.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players who came from outside the island by cooperating with local orthopedic hospitals and hospital officials.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Elabco in Chimei-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.

Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Mr. Mogi extorted that the incompetent otoko stick to the conventional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool guy.
if you are bound by what you should do
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and behavior of people.
When you learn patterns, you will be able to live in comfort because the brain systematizes behavior by doing this better.
I think it's still evolving every day, apart from whether it's "mote."
So it's easy to live.
I taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, you might be a bit tough if you stick to the old pattern of "a university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will survive.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I talked about that in my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by admitting that person.
It's not that easy.
It's painful to ask yourself around.
Isn't Takeshi doing this at the Cannes Film Festival?
Although he is light, his surroundings will be treated as "a wonderful film director."
Those who have a track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," it is not easy.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of position or age, it seems that any man "cute" will be an excuse and salvation.
It is difficult to wonder what this "cute" is.
what is it?
Nigeria's illegal northwest, doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 in the last four months due to intensified violence.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), a "new humanitarian crisis" has been created, and by the end of this year, a new $35.5 million fund-raising activity is required by each institution.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist organization that has been working on anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, increased violence in the last 10 months in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina states in Nigeria was caused by organized armed groups.
"We often show the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok told reporters on Friday.
The press said that kidnapping, torture, robberies, murder and sexual violence were frequent, and raiders destroyed houses and worked on theft.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime organizations in the area.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Boko Haram and the West African branch of Islamic State, which was split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," Barrok says.
What they bring is a terrifying experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR stated in a statement that security conditions were deteriorating, especially in Sokot, and that refugees going to Niger would increase in the coming months.

The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) has started advertising on header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to the needs of each advertiser.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system in which multiple bidders (advertisers) compete in fair bidding, allowing media managed by media to deliver high-priced ads preferentially.
It has been introduced mainly by major media as a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability.
In the past, we have provided SSP with advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers that "I want to deliver to a specific advertising frame that has high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP, in collaboration with media companies, started in December last year to directly purchase advertising frames in line with advertisers' requests.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP is expanded.
The benefits for advertisers are that LFP header bindings allow them to participate in bidding directly to the target advertising frame, which is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, because the target media company is limited, the advertisement frame of the destination according to the individual commercial materials and brand image is secured, preventing damage to brand value.
One of the advantages of media companies is that it is possible to implement initiatives in accordance with the expectations of the introduction of media companies through a solution that bundles and manages the code of bidder companies called " wrapper solutions" that LFP promotes collaboration.

Two-month suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata University in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
Yamagata University announced on July 27 that a male assistant professor in his 30s at Yonezawa Campus (Yonezawa City) was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the General Affairs Department of the University of Tokyo, Assistant Professors of the University of Tokyo, from around October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, were emotional and abused in inappropriate words.

Cabinet Revolts Boris Johnson calls for a compromise with the EU by reducing the EU's withdrawal request.
Just three weeks after the EU summit meeting, the Prime Minister's concern is growing around the Prime Minister that it might be too late to bring out significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion demanding a reduction in the demands of the EU withdrawal and a compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system replacing the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are jammed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany will propose a compromise plan, such as a three-year time limit on the backstop, to the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They are demanding that the Prime Minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings with uncontracted withdrawals, and insist that the EU accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One Cabinet member said that the Supreme Court's ruling that the closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday would be "an alarm."
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must make use of what is available.
There is no effect even if it becomes radical, and Cummings' plans are obviously unsuccessful.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to implement the previous Prime Minister's proposal, if not.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many things that everyone is trying to end.
If we postpone it, Boris is over, and we are all over.
Sir John Meiger accused Boris of not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a bitter speech, said: "The Prime Minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw the Prime Minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs with the Whales, and discussing with the people on the streets - as if the election campaign was full-fledged."
The prime minister's press yesterday acknowledged that the agreement was still a long way ahead, and said, "If anyone can't make a mistake - achieve the goal, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which would force a three-month postponement if a non-agreed withdrawal, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue their progress despite the bill's passage."
The European Union Delegation Minister Stephen Berkeley returns to Brussels today for further consultation with the EU's Michel Barnier.
The two discuss how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by the television boss that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, "very nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, looked back at 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone on the TV-am team and to see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my favorite place is here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbride, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorraine.
To celebrate her 35th anniversary, she presents a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
The host said that passion and enthusiasm and curiosity were the key to survival in the television industry, and added, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I did not think that many of the families of children who were killed or injured watched us broadcast the show live from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, one of her mother's five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, said that he personally wanted to see me, so we spoke at her house for hours.
Not taking up all that on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
In addition, Kelly interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very hard" and that "we really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets of knowing what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing the trap.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of a presidential post from former President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to fears that it might be a trap to defy military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Chiwenga declined the offer, not because of anxiety, but because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was stripped of his government in a coup.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirmed that officials were senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who had been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munnagagwa," it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
The government official said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was carried out by three persons.
President Spokesman George Charamba, senior officials said that he was involved in negotiations by Aaron Nepera, then head of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Fidelis Muconoli, Roman Catholic bishop.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was entrusted by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to denounce military action by the African Union, seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the president to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was a wasteful action to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there were a few political aims of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If there was anything to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I would like to remind you that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and crush the claims of the commanders claiming that the constitutional order was not broken.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had yet to decide whether to position the situation as a coup without fully grasping the whole situation, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe moved when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the presidential house called Blue Roof, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe said he wanted two things: to protect his family and to prove his deprivation by the military.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
A strong figurative expression was used in the words of the envoy (gono) who conveyed the desperate message of the president: "Is Tiri Bemaqwapa Macwapa (we belong to the camouflage group, the military), and we are not politicians or political competitors."
The Army told other military commanders in the area that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the aim was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coup and successors, Mugabe attempted to re-call the short-term exile in South Africa using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the South African Development Community at the time, South Africans, who were key to this process, refused to intervene, but threatened repeatedly behind it, clarifying that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military had invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources state.
The United Nations appeals for the prohibition of nuclear weapons by A-bomb II | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held.
Five countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and 32 countries and territories were ratified.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the total elimination of nuclear weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech, expressing strong concern that in recent years there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
He stressed that there is no other way to abolish it.
China needs strong leadership, otherwise collapse - policy documents
Before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In a white paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party's administration 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complex, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will face division and collapse, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified dealing with problems in a rigid manner, such as the 1989 repression of the democratization movement in Beijing, as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who is the leading figure in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he took power in late 2012.
Xi has also directed a military modernization program that threatens the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export the development model of its own country, does not intend to incorporate models of other countries, and only seeks peace rather than supremacy.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the powerful, and war and confusion left a deep scar with that pain; China would never take the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in Chinese Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "abandon" its core interests, nor allow its security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"The threat of trade war and the rising tariffs do not lead to any problem-solving," White Paper states.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"We will never weaken the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China has the power to face difficulties, turn crisis into opportunities and open a new world.
Since China has no idea of countering the United States, and does not want to replace the United States, the United States should take the development of China calmly.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Takatake dismissed Director Hirata and Director Kaneko of Sports News - Yahoo!
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as director and the director (responsibility teacher) will be determined promptly.
As for Director Hirata and Director Kaneko, the local newspaper reported on the 26th that there was a rumor about baseball club members.
After hearing the situation from the two students, Director Hirata grabbed the student's head and Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of a survey conducted by 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they generally accepted the facts and dismissed them on 28th.
Yokohama was defeated in the summer of 15 by Motochika WATANABE (74), who raised pitchers such as Daisuke MATSUSAKA and others.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
From summer 16 to summer 16 he participated in Koshien for three consecutive years, and this spring he also participated in Senbatsu.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in autumn, and the Senbatsu tournament in next spring was desperate.
Spice Girls' Mel C, eating disorders, eating disorders, etc.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom admitted that home-based diets were banned because of his own eating disorder that he had not eaten anything except fruit and vegetables for many years.
Sporty spices, under pressure from members of the global pop group, have long been "excessive exercise" without having to eat enough, and have subsequently been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by the child rearing of his beloved daughter Scarlett, and stated that "all topics related to diet in the family are prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was able to be very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
In the 1990s, when she gained fame as a member of the Spice Girls, still in front of SNS, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that "bad" comments about herself in the press led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I took out certain food groups, became more and more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin," Mel said.
I was sick, and that situation lasted for about a few years."
Same-sex marriage justice judgment The opportunity to expand diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch made a decision to approve the case in which 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage was established even between same sex.
More than 20 countries recognize same-sex marriage, and there is a system in which municipalities such as Sapporo City certify same-sex partnerships, which are not legally effective in Japan.
As a result, the court ruled that two women were actually married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to grant legal protection to same-sex couples.
Because of the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Registration Law, it is unconstitutional that the same-sex marriage is not permitted.
We would like to deepen our understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities, and discuss the legal system that recognizes diverse families.
The women lived together for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the United States.
The court ruled that "the reality of marriage between men and women is no different" from the fact that the two lived together.
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of actual marriages with the same-sex rights, such as social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution which defines marriage as "only based on the agreement of both sexes."
Both sexes were "unpresumed to be same-sex marriages at the time of establishment, so it is not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
It is expected that "the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage," but whether it is prohibited or not, will be a driving force for same-sex marriage litigation in various places.
On the other hand, since the same-sex marriage was not recognized, the problem remained that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection differ from that of men and women."
It may be difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while recognizing the same situation as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, 70 percent of respondents believed that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" admitted by law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the lack of joint custody.
In the examination of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of viewpoints, including not only the same-sex marriage but also the expansion of legal rights for actual marriage.
Trials and jury trials of former athletes prosecuted for rape of multiple women
A jury trial is held at the trial of former Delaware University baseball players accused of sexual assault on multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
A 21-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted after she drove Conaway home.
The two met after three weeks of meeting at Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women's inconsistency and misrepresentation might have regretted having physical relations.

However, after the ceremony, when asked by the press about the point, he said, "It's not finished yet, so it's all."
[Dospo] Ota is the 4th and 20th most self-registered after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
It became a reward for the seniors.
Four times in one lead, he hit his 20th home run with a liner on the left.
I arrived at the number of home runs I was aiming for, and he said, "I stopped this number and tried to do it again, and it became a big one."
The director's intention was also firm.
This was the first time a four-year contract was signed.
He said, "I put it in number four so that I could swing unexpectedly."
Dada responded to his expectations: "I felt so excited that I was in the game, and I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal four statues is Abe, a giant who retired from active duty this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads to victory, and the 4th is the team's 4th and the 4th seniors I've seen with the giants were the same."
Among them, "Abe-san's appearance comes to mind the most, he was a reliable person, and he looked at his back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, obviously in video
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $2109 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest employer with opera houses, Circular Keys, Luna Park and some of the famous Harbour Bridges.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist destinations is one of the dirtyest places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with shells, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes lost by someone, as well as animal corpses - all of which are flooded by rainwater flowing through the road.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting waterways.
Coincidentally, the video was released on September 27 of the World Tourism Day, and Dr. Katherine Dafoon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
Although it looks beautiful, it is one of the most modified and contaminated estuaries of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour is expected to flow into the waterway, most of which flow through the rainwater drain into Sydney Harbour.
"There were heavy rains several times, but Sydney Harbour was... quite tragic."
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If we don't go down the sea level, we don't know the truth about what's there," said Richard Nichols, owner of Dive Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what's under the water), I think everyone will be really surprised.
Over half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The remaining half is made of plastic at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing right under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles better, and eventually flows into the ocean.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a food source.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, coincided with the release of the video funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of a broader awareness of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers remaining in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also noted that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed were increasingly worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Station will be demolished in October | Saga News|Saga Shimbun
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which began demolition work in October, is Futako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin dismantling the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Plant (oil-fired power plant) in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction is expected to be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantling was used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991 due to aging.
One smokestack is broken down by a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine buildings and boilers have not been demolished.
A man in his 60s who runs a restaurant nearby said, "When I look back from the distance and see a chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel back to Karatsu.

It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has a site area of about 225 thousand square meters.
Since Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station are nearby, the prefecture and the city are hoping to use the site.
Three of them, including nine electric cars, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

I am now (CBC Television) - Yahoo! News
This time, Maya Takahashi, a monthly commentator on CBC TV's Chant!, spoke about his master.
my mentor's advice was to save my rotten self.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi, beyond his father, is like a master.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I am different from what I do, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to do my best, and what is important to me as a member of society.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was told that I was a connor or a busaik, and I was struck so badly, my father said, "I thought it was a conné, but it wasn't so.
Then, around the second or third year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty woman can do it," and even when I wasn't motivated because I didn't want to do the job I wanted to do, and my heart was rotten, "Anyone can do the work hard."If so, I asked Mama to do it, but I was glad that I was in charge of it.
i learned from my father's performance naturally.
There may be a lot of people who have never seen me read the news, but in fact, since I joined the TV station, I have been exposed to the news through narration of BS and news programs.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when I read the news manuscript, and I was happy that Mr. Matsuko Deluxe praised me for being good at reading Mama news.
When I read the news, I feel that it's important and sensed.
The readings, how to take the breath and how to interact with each other have been cultivated through watching father's stage, film, television, and period dramas in childhood.
More importantly, I think that my father's work on variety shows and how to deal with them is thanks to my childhood experience.
The 300-year history of kumidori/education dissemination project | Miyako Mainichi Shimbun Website - The latest news of Miyakojima is packed!
Workshops in Kagamihara
Workshop on the role and effect of five musical instruments played by kumidori (a group dance) = 26th, Kagamihara Junior High School
A group dance workshop (hosted by the Prefectural Board of Education Education Agency) was held at Kagamihara Junior High School on February 26.
All students attended and learned about the 300-year history and birth of kumidori, as well as the acoustic effects and use of musical instruments played.
In the workshop, members of the OB group of the Ryukyu Performing Arts Department of the Prefectural University of Arts introduced the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing sanshin, koto, taiko, kokyu and flute.
The host was Mr. Kawamitsu, a member of the OB association from Miyakojima City, and introduced the charm of kumi odori.
In this workshop, I took up "music" among the three components of kumidori (music, chant, Ryukyu dance) and learned how five types of musical instruments were expressed in dance.
As for the sanshin, it was explained that it was an element of the movement and emotional expression of the characters' hearts along with the songs, and that Kokyu pulled out the songs and the melody of the sanshin while playing.
In the second half, the students actually touched the instrument and felt its tone, and felt the charm of the instrument.
The purpose of this initiative is to get familiar with "Ryukyu classical music" through musical instruments, and to get interested in "gumi Odori" by many students.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Looking back on past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18 cards.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship, is one of the four World Championships under the jurisdiction of the FIA.
It has been held every year since 1973, and has become the world's highest rally championship with history and tradition.The competition is said to be the most challenging car competition because it runs not only on closed roads (paved roads), but also on gravel and snow roads at high speeds.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturing Challenger title for the second season since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Invitation Preparatory Committee was established to host the event.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, talked about the Japan Round.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with relevant parties to ensure that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Japan as the center of motorsports representing Japan and that it will be a big event to appeal to the world.
Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japanese round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports competition in the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all here."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and Representative Director of Toyota Motor Corporation)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motor Sports, commented on the Japan Round.
The WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City and Shitara Town) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ena City).
The main venue is "Love · Global Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
The Japan Round Invitation Preparatory Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 test event will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is tasmaniadeville the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmanian devil may be the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient care.
Medical researchers have found out how some cancer cells camouflage.
Researchers found that the same process occurred in Tasmania Devil and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will lead to new treatments for cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy could significantly alter their treatments for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing deadly facial tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils, which are on the verge of extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and plastics use a series of proteins called PRC2 to cam fullage, eliminating the reaction of markers and preventing the immune system from attacking cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and melkel cells.
Peter McCallum researcher Mark Dawson said, "The very important thing in this project is that for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy, we may be able to reverse that process."
Traditional treatments may be reused to revitalize markers, or proteins known as MHCs, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"There is a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where similar cases of cancer cells escape detection.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process happens (in humans and Tasmanian devils)," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils so far.
However, if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, it may help control tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists find and surprise the Solar System, a giant Jupiter-shaped planet orbiting around a small star called a red dwarf, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting its main star around the red dwarf was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
But in this case, the magnitude of stars and planets is not much different, the researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12 percent of the Sun's size, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, led this research published in the journal Science.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, composed primarily of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperatures.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planets, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 degrees Celsius (6380 degrees Celsius / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I have a reddish color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining its elliptical orbit.
Planets are produced from the same disk, composed of interstellar gas and dust that produced the star that orbits itself.
The most powerful planetary formation model, known as the "core accumulation" model, generates objects from solid particles in the disk, and the gravity produced by the egg of the planet increases the surrounding gas into the atmosphere.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star may have been slightly larger and less temperature than was thought," Morales said.
In this state, the disk becomes unstable, so some dense regions may emerge.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a bean dip containing a stimulant to his colleagues, and he was charged.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) was accused of eating a dip of beans with a stimulant to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was accused of transferring methane fetamine, a Class B felony, and of taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit obtained from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff to taste it a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigator that he had never done methane phetamine before, "After eating a few mouths, I thought it tasted strange, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach got worse and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, at a local hospital where a woman had gone, soy dip could have contained methane phetamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee told Medina Hernández that he had "druged" the victim's food, while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message that he had accidentally put methane fetamine in a bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows Medina Hernández pointing his back to the camera and clinginging behind the microwave, but extracting something from the brazier.
After that, he stood up and wiped his nose, walked toward the table and put a bean dip in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff did not think there were customers who had been given contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández is held in Marion County Prison, instead of a bail of $5.2 million.
According to The Smoking Gunn, Medina Hernández's long-term arrest record includes assault, robbery, spoofing, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

The prefecture is concerned that the spring water from the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that "If there is something that can be realistic, but considering the safety of the construction, I think it is difficult."
He denied that the route change mentioned by Governor Kawakatsu Heita was "not possible."
President Kaneko pointed out three locations: Minami Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station, which are particularly time-consuming for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Administrative and Social News|Saga ShimbunLiVE
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required reorganization and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced the hospital's name on September 26.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in the country, and three have already been integrated and relocated.
Publicized hospitals in the prefecture are the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Taku City), Kojo Citizen Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital in Taramachi, Fujitsu County.
Of these, Takyu City Hospital and Kojo Municipal Hospital are planning to build a new hospital in Higashi-Takyu-cho, Takyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating surplus in recent years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi stressed that "the town has the idea of operating alone and cooperating with hospitals in neighboring towns, and the hospital must be left absolutely for residents."
The administrative director of Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "We do not hear the contents from the prefecture," and concluded that "We will actively participate in the prefectural regional medical concept coordination meeting and respond based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Organization for Promotion of Regional Medical Functions (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not a mechanical decision to determine the direction of public hospitals, but rather a request to review them again at the Regional Medical Concept Coordination Conference in each prefecture."
"We would like to hear from the parties about the future operation of the hospital.
In some cases, we may ask you to review the medical treatment courses and to further reduce the beds."

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise and frequent use of royal aircraft has been revealed.
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use a private machine that moves the royal family around the world for important events and appearances.
Of course, there is a privilege to have a private aircraft.
There is no limit to the number of baggage, and the Royal Family seems to be able to invite guests, including unexpected passengers, as much as they like.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, only Queen and Prince Philip are frequent customers of royal aircraft.
During the "Royal Flight Secret" program, the Queen's former flight attendants revealed that many of her hairy guests with her family were frequently on board.
Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, like most important royal customers, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggy Dog Privileges are famous, and it is not surprising to request that a cute pet be brought together to travel.
Queen Elizabeth loved dogs since she was a child, and it is said that she had more than 30 coggie dogs when she became queen.
In 2007, he had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linette, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, five Cockerspaniel bets, oxo, flash, pick, and spans were added, as well as four mix dogs cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The staff on the Royal Aircraft will be busy.
The royal staff were seen asking them to leave the dog on the lawn before boarding, and Seals continued.
I've never been in an accident.
The show also found that her luggage during her public service trip was known for shocking amounts.
According to the Narrator, "The Queen's luggage was 12 tons during a 44,000-mile Commonwealth tour in 1953."
It is well understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
But the queen is not the only one who likes fashion.
The wife of the Marquis of Cambridge is also said to have a unique taste when carrying her clothes, and in Uwasa, she takes one seat per dress.

In the first wave of Republicans in Deep South, Jack Edwards, a retired Alabama state senator who served as a 10-year federal legislator, died on Friday.
Edward was reported by his bereaved family through his agent that he died at his home in Fairhope after a struggle with pancreatic cancer.
As the Republican Party gained momentum in Deep South, many Alabama Republicans were elected federal legislators, but Edwards was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1965 as one of its first wave.
Edwards served ten terms in Congress.
According to the announcement made by the bereaved family, Edwards recently asked what kind of world he would like to leave to his grandchild's generation and said he wanted to return to the liturgy.
According to his family, "I want my grandchildren to grow up in a country that has regained reverence for daily conversation and efforts to solve the problems of my country."
Governor Kay Ibii said Edwards served the state and state with the highest honor.
He also stated that he plans to hold a half flag at the Alabama State Capitol.
"Mr. Edwards was a true public servant and the largest politician in Alabama.
My state lost one of the best politicians."

In a frank conversation, the former President's wife looked back on how her mother and mother changed herself.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "Being a mother is like being in a senior class to let go."
My job as a mother was almost always to find and grow what children wanted to be.
To find out who they are, in essence, rather than the ideals for children as parents or the aspirations of their childhood.
In an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine, Mrs. Obama gave little advice to Duchess.
sometimes you feel too much pressure from yourself and people around you.
So, my biggest advice is that there is no rush to do anything over time.

Trump Hotel owner's suitability complaints, liquor sales license holds.
Washington (AP) - The Board of Alcohol and Beverage Auditors in Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the local Trump International Hotel's license to sell liquor because of the question of the suitability of the owner.
On Wednesday, three MPs, two former judges and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on a state law that requires the applicant to obtain a liquor license.
The first appeal filed in the summer of last year cited President Trump's assault charges and repeated frauds, claiming they violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This is the second time a petition has been issued to update the permit.
The honey collected by Bentley's Flying Bees is the first harvest!
How is the taste of honey collected by Flying Bees bred at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September 2019.
More than 100 honey bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the site of a factory where cars were assembled?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honeys produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we installed a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers have been watching the bees from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains collecting nectar from various flowers.
It was found that this place was suitable for beekeeping, and it was wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been engaged in a wide range of activities through its Crew Plant and its business to become the top sustainable luxury automobile manufacturer, and is also part of this.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of bentree honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to fulfill our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million honey bees "Fly Bees" were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, the nest frame was put on a centrifugal separator, filtered the fallen honey, and then bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The label was designed by Louise McCallum, the designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we also want to enjoy afternoon tea by combining "Flying Bees" honey with scones.
The Cleveland Police, a series of scandals, reports of fraud that are considered the worst in the United Kingdom
A police officer who followed the scandal was labeled as the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
According to the Cleveland Police Department, "heavy deterioration" continues.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to stop the crime, arrest the suspect, and protect the socially vulnerable.
Phil Gomley of the Police Directorate said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Police chief Mike Wiel resigned in January less than a year after his inauguration, but was subjected to "deep" investigation of his actions, but several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal activities.
Lieutenant Simon Herwood, last year, went to the Commission for Investigation of Illegal Acts, for the reason that he directed colleagues to do sexual acts.
He resigned the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Home Affairs intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I am fully responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal," and impeachment has to be settled.
Nobody knows what will happen.
At present, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate."
"We're going to do a job that we're starting to do based on the time it takes to discover facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Wolodymyr Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to the call record, Trump also asked Zerensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his own personal adviser, Rudy Giulini.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was the national security attorney of the Ministry of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before the formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged with inquiry from information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of violations of political funds.
In response to Burr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee decided to ask who to testify.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched on Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the telephone talks with the President of Ukraine in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision on the handling of this accusation.
Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower who became the source of information when Trump attacked the whistleblower as a spy on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spy was different in the past.
The president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said a terrible thing about the person who could provide information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that Trump would formally impeach him about the alleged pressure on foreign leaders for political gain and noted a historic step.
The call was included in a statement released on Thursday, in which whistleblowers claimed that Trump abused his office in the next 2020 presidential election to "see intervention" in Ukraine.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-level computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace Forward Christian Bentek, driving ban by speed violation
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, is likely to be banned from driving.
The 28-year-old forward at Crystal Palace confirmed on January 20, that he had driven his Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 limit speed in Richmond, southwest London.
The Belgians then photographed a speed violation camera in March at Patney, southwest London, driving 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, living in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not need to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek pleaded guilty to these two violations under a single trial procedure in which one magistrate tried and sentenced him to light crime.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu is concerned about the composition of the judging committee.
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and board member of Secondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the upcoming GFA elections.
He questioned the inclusion of Frank Davids, and expressed dissatisfaction with it.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu said that the chairman had a stake in the results of the review process and that it was fair or doubtful to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should be composed of a fair and neutral member from outside who is not related to or previously uninterested.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kwak Palmer about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwer, Chairman of the Board.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Appocavi, sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered the target of raising the minimum wage to be 1,000 yen.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and only 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded that they "approved" to raise the yen to 1,000 yen per hour, including information related (100 percent), construction (70, 6 percent), and wholesale (61, 7 percent).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink, and lodging.
The representative of the meeting said, "Although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with high part-time and hourly wages, there are many companies that think it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs."
An average of 895 yen (from 4 October to 829 yen in Fukui Prefecture) was paid when companies responded that they were "opposed."
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, a total of 61.3% of regular employees were hired, 54.5% were hired, and 15.4% were non-regular employees.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of scheduled graduates was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, transportation (37.5%) and construction (24.1%, 38.1%) were struggling.
As a result, 86.4% of the total number of applicants had problems in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government for the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the recruitment of new graduates (departure within three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-sectors and/or businesses proposed in the growth strategy have already been recognized.
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one third of the total showed acceptance.
64.4% of companies were "not admitted" and high in construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%), and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the decisive battle with the Australians
Justin Tiprick said that Wales will be hosting the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Wallabeads, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D and will probably be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory over Wales was the 14th victory, Tiprick and his team would be a straight line of eight best matches against England.
"Of course, both teams want to try and win at the top of the group and end," said Tiprick, Franker in Wales.
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win last autumn.
I think Australia will be quite blameful to return the loan, but I will do my best to win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And now I'm here, it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, while Wales has won third place 32 years ago.
And under the supervision of Warren Gutland, the total score for the 3rd Southern Hemisphere Heavyweight Team was only 7 out of 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was one of the few representatives who won 9-6 of the match and played at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
Certainly the game was tough, and maybe everyone thought it was impossible to win, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
In order for Wales to win, the key is the Australian combination of Michael Hooper, David Pocock, and Tiplic's Breakdown Battle.
Tiplick, who has played 67 international matches so far, has fought several matches and both players in the past, and knows exactly what awaits him.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you will be facing a tough game from now on.
They are always at the highest level in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and improve myself rather than confronting such a strong background.
I want to fight against the best opponents, and if I fight against them, I have to keep up.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up good performances, you will be able to play a game that won't lose.

East Enders, Nettle: Ben kisses the column after Whitney bomb news.
In the East Enders, the column highway (Tony Clay) was surprised by the sudden bomb news of Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), so the column returned to the mistress, and the hot tension between Column and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowen) was on the verge of explosion.
But will the relationship between the two begin or will you regret this hot moment?
Since Column helped Ben and the troubled Bobby Beer (Cray Milner Russell), the relationship has been slowly progressing, but Column recently told Ben that he was happy to see Ben's weakness and kindness, and he thought he would date a bit.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from a comedian?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said at a press conference on July 22 that "the company is 9 and there is no talent 1 or so at all," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the "9:1" ratio, it would be considered that there was a gift from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and investors' views that taxes would be paid were also reported on Twitter.
If the amount of Galla was "9:1," would there be a gift tax?
I heard from Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the tax standpoint.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen is "9:1," Yoshimoto Kogyo will have a profit of 1 million yen in sales and 90 million yen in expenses.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns like this and already pay corporate taxes.
Also, even if you think about the allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount I received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying or selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a problem in calculating taxes.
However, as in this case, a third party will not be able to decide how much tax-appropriate prices are for those transactions that both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think it's a poison to pay for one yen.

the white house, the impeachment foothold, panic.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, explaining that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seemed to be growing "a concern, anxiety, and concern" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some of the surrounding persons.
He said, "I don't really think it's true."
The White House official joked that there were no obvious plans for the situation, or that the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied, so this claim was so serious that he was not sure how to proceed, "it seems not to be erased from the next news reported."
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's uncontrollable response would increase the likelihood of being "incompetent."
Another source of information says that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised every day, and some close associates of the president are expected to further "impulsive" behavior.
Trump has spurred concerns about increasingly unpredictable actions and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about the president and politics in the electoral year.
Trump has faced the greatest threat ever seen in his presidential term, and has transformed himself into an offensive, defense, and others, such as reviving the strategy he judged effective during the Russian investigation by Robert Morler.
Trump tried to disregard the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for partisan conflict.
However, many White House officials have endured the Mora test, but this time they are starting to feel the difference.
The president, whose power is considered a brand, seemed to be coming to the press conference on Wednesday, said a detailed person in this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have answered questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that damage can be mitigated, claiming that it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information on the calls between President Trump and Vladimir Zellensky, who are controversial, and the Ukrainian president.
In addition, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategy close to the White House points out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and that the impeachment will not have much effect on gaining new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news during the next four months, "there is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President."
Another source stated that those claiming impeachment could be the help of the president did not fully understand how uncertain the president's response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the plan's ostensibly, it is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented and what kind of actions will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a recognition that a clear leader who can organize public relations activities aggressively is needed to counter organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, and the momentum that the publication and publication of critical internal accusations have given the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin stated that they would not publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later, saying that the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible.
It is expected that more pressure will be raised at the time of the investigation by Robert Morler, who spoke only through almost silent prosecutions.According to the person involved in the case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment will be called Trump's external pitbull and Corey Luwandowski, who served as the head of the former electoral ward.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support our policies with the President for the past five years, but we've never talked to the President or his close associates about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left the White House, and Pat Cipolon, the current White House legal adviser, lacks such experience, and the White House currently lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy is generally recognized that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but need to be organized and capable of leading all-out response and political struggle.

I had a boyfriend all the time, but due to his work, I had a long distance romance ...
I was told to marry someday, but I couldn't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation to marriage by side?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice derived from detailed data analysis is mandatory.
what's this?
I am worried whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during a long distance romance.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I have work and my family, but his place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, administrative office)
The couple who got married from long distance love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (hereinafter, -) C is in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend for one and a half years.
There is also a saying that "the two become stronger after being tested for distance," but in the first place, is a long distance love going well?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) Speaking of distance love, the survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous.
Since love is done with five senses, the relationship is deepened by looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touch), smelling (or smelling) and kissing (taste).
However, in the case of distant love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It can be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to the other person's house, you will be burdened with the time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even though it is a holiday to heal the tiredness of the work, the body is kata.
I feel happy when I return home.
Isn't it necessary to break up when it comes to distance?
Morikawa If you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently, or a couple that has a certain period of time, I think it will work.
You'll be engaged a year later, or you'll come back from your transfer two years later.
It may be difficult to find a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of demands for "Trump nude pictures."
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump will be investigated.
Thursday, in a comment defending the president, accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain presidential nude photos.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive of the House Information Special Committee, filed in the opening statement of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had requested to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the president's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotessic show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After the rebuke of Congressman Nunes ended, HuffPost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to find out if the Democrats were looking for the truth.
Only Congressman Jim Heims of the Connecticut Democratic Party has responded so far, but many other members are also questionable whether the answer is red-naked truth.
Memediate.com speculates that Nunes' nudist comments may also be related to the "more unconfirmed details" that are said to have been written in a controversial steel document.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to the "Oshikko Tape" in a hotel room in Moscow, where Trump is said to be watching prostitutes urinate, suggesting existence.
Origami, wallet and real cards.

The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they will start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and Representative Director of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services that solve the challenges of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates," adding that "We would like to provide services that are equally useful for people who have been alienated from finance and those who have not been able to benefit from the current system."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have an Origami ID, you can seamlessly complete your application from application to transaction and get timely information.

Regenerative biofuel research can reduce emissions
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only airplane to fly in the air and not reach renewable energy.
However, Professors at the University of Alberta developed a technology to make renewable biofuels available as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude fuel, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology achieved (actually generated) is hydrocarbons of molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low-risk approach that requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that have already been partially developed to maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Regarding the second option, Dr. Bressler said, "You can try it in a reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Currently, Foge operates a test plant near the waste management center in Edmonton, and recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build 25 million US production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel per year.
Dr. Bressler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher in terms of fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bressler says.
My job is to create options so that multiple options can be made in parallel with the decisions made after the explanation.

Boris Johnson's campaign warned that if Brexit was overturned, the British would face riots like Los Angeles, and the prime minister would call for calm.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the outcome of the first round, there was a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson said he needed to "enhage anger" against the political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but insisted that he would not use the term "defeat."
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain calm, one minister told The Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gile Joan or the Los Angeles riots of 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country just because they have never happened before.
There's already a look at the yellow vest movement - they're encrypting their phones and putting together demonstrations, and a few populist leaders who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat Rodney King, a black taxi driver, to be found innocent.
This year, the French anti-government protesters wearing eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to leave the EU, "the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating."
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted in the EU, 10 million people would be dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a danger of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to hold a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson has been reported to be facing a House of Representatives rebellion demanding lower demands for EU withdrawal and instead to hit the EU with a compromise.

pakistan, brother of social media celebrity, sentenced to life in honor of murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memory of the case fades.
"It's too long, so people forget," said the women's rights activist Farzana Bali, the founder of the first gender department at a university in Pakistan, adding that even the case of Balochi, which is attracting attention, took more than three years to solve.
Human rights groups say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honored murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much more than that, since it is estimated that Pakistan accounts for approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honor killings of honor-based violence surveillance organizations worldwide every year.
Anti-pork cholera measures 1.3 billion yen Add to the September supplementary plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo!

Floods and disruptions caused by prolonged monsoons in many parts of India
The monsoon season in India lasts for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and deaths, and many of the crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their power in early September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37% higher than usual.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues for a few days, the monsoon will weaken at the latest decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays destroyed buildings and killed several people.
The houses are flooded, and the inhabitants walk through the streets with water on their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Laknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains caused damage to homes.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
For farmers, prolonged monsoons are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon at this time.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmhouse in Vimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables will rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoon.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also threatened.
The next big festival is Dashera on 8 October, where the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, the evil smiling figure of the beard-boo appearing in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroys evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, the last laugh may be Lavana.
[Sendai] Defeat Yokohama M with Compact Defense Director Watanabe (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
J1 Begarta Sendai held a private practice for four days from 24 to 4 consecutive days (open to the press only for 20 minutes at the beginning) for the 28th Battle of Yokohama M (at 7:00 p.m.
Yokohama M lost 15 points in the last three league games, but coach Shin Watanabe (45) responded by saying, "The players showed me powerful, battle-like exercises."
Last season, he lost eight of his clubworth's eight games at home (July 18).
It is a difficult enemy to lose in 1-2 this season.
Yokohama M is currently ranked 14th in the league with 48 points in Thailand.
In addition to the 13-point FW Marcos Juniol (26), 10-point 7-assisted FW Nakagawa Teruto (27) and other strong front-line players, J's leading CB combination of Japan National Team DF Hatakenaka Makinosuke (24) and Brazilian DF Chiago Multins (24) are also waiting.
Director Watanabe said, "There is plenty of aggressive play in and out, there is also a speed CB, I want to protect compact and fight with confidence without seeing the tear."
The Emperor's Cup, which aimed to win the first championship, was defeated by J2 Nagasaki on August 18, and the remaining eight league matches were played.
The commander said, "It was a regrettable loss, and from there it is the most important now."
It enhances the feeling and shows the results of the measures in the pitch.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
Recent studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent compared to men who did not work around pesticides.
"The emphasis on this study is the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides at work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure at work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of the Department of Elderly Care at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this research may not be applied to women and other races, as it only targets Japanese Americans.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of follow-up research, the relationship between exposure of pesticides at work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to the aging of the population and hiding the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low- and medium-density pesticides has no significant relevance to heart disease or heart attack.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone meeting
The impeachment proceedings against US President Donald Trump were taken, and the Washington political issue was a radical week.
For political beginners Vologzimir Zellensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
But what has been known about the Zellensky Trump telephone problem so far, and is there a widespread impact on Zellensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had many advantages over Ukraine from other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail as Trump's criticism that Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders were dedicated to speaking rather than concrete proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's 1000% argument is controversial.
Zerensky added that President Macron and Merkel both did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no previous support received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the EU's support including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the "Russian invasion."
The Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytica said, "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scolded military aid and asked Zellensky to investigate two rather than one, one for the son of Joe Biden Hunter, and the other for the server of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail incursion during the 2016 election.
It is uncertain whether this would hinder European relations or lay backwater against French and German leaders.
I don't want to talk about anyone.
Thanks to the announcement of the call record, I am grateful to those who support it."
Zellensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety prize was awarded in recognition of Ghana's provisional implementation rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification survey (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the World Safety Director Audit Report of the United Nations Air Agency.
The safety award was recognized by Ghana to comply with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO on safety at airports and national airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's delayed zero campaign support.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for security evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was awarded to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada to Nii Aikoi Otou, and Director of Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Olmiwa Bennard Aliou stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to always be aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability remain the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada said that this award complements the indomitable efforts and perseverance of the sector and is a gift of Ghanaian efforts.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump appoints Peter Gino as FEMA Chief: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Senate Committee in Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
FEMA's deputy director, Gino, was in the position of deputy director of government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been vacant since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, decided that Mr. Long had illegally used government vehicles to commute to work between Washington and his home, Norcarorina.
Another recommendation was Jeffrey Baiard, who was suspected of being drunk and involved in the riots in his own life survey, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of this month after the examination.
Mr. Gino's appointment as secretary was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Department in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police shut down illegal marijuana bating activities in San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant on suspicion of selling illegal marijuana pens, care began at 4:37 p.m., and a large container of butanhanie oil was found in an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found equipment to pack the beep cartridge.
"This process is very dangerous," said Cano.
Lieutenant Cano said that he had previously been involved in narcotics investigations and that there was a possibility of a fire in the process of extracting oil used for the beep product.
"The static electricity from clothes alone can ignite, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," says Lieutenant Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions one after another, but also by fire.
The dangerous goods processing team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigator said that he received some anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant on the site that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still trying to figure out who the illegal burp activity is.
The police said that because the office was empty, Zhang himself thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to prevent illegal bating products from appearing again.
"I don't know if it's real or what I'm buying."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a significant impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a big earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6!
Evacuation training in Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
In anticipation of an earthquake occurring during the concert, a practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City.
This training is held every year.
On stage, there is actually a performance by the Miyazaki Fire Department, and it is assumed that an earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6 is occurring along the way of the song.
About 300 people including kindergarten children, local residents and hall staff participated in the training on the 27th.

"It's an earthquake, it's an earthquake, it's an earthquake.Please keep your body low and wait there."
After that, the participants evacuated to the entrance, assuming that a fire occurred.
Earthquakes that do not know when and where to occur.
The participants increased their awareness of disaster prevention through training.
The lost dress of Elizabeth I, exhibited at Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver foil yarn, and the gorgeous embroidery of plants, animals and butterflies was fluffy.
Herre Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, is determined to be one point.
This faded piece of cloth, hung on the wall of a small church in one countryside, is said to have been placed there 100 years ago, and is considered part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this gorgeous cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly the room that the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one of the 16th-century dresses remains, indicating that it was an important discovery throughout the Royal Dress Collection.
Although there was no perfect evidence of Elizabeth's passing of her sleeves, three years of research increased the confidence of experts that the dress was not part of the royal possession.
The "silver silk cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but it also suggests that the embroidered plants and flowers of the "meite" quality, as well as the patterns of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later, were noble persons of the former owners.
It is believed that the dress was equivalent to a Tudor mansion when it was built.
Furthermore, in the 1590s, at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is assumed that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace or could not stand up against rivals wearing such luxury clothing.
Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
I was always very happy to see the cloth and say, "It's amazing."
A long second life of one piece of dress that was cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton, which is not surprising.
Bactton is a native village of Blanche Parry, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and is said to have long been associated with Parry.
Although the dress dates back to 1590, experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church in memory of Parry before Elizabeth died in 1603.
Over 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on very delicate hand sewing, the altarpiece will be displayed next to the portrait of Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired modern paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The large enough space to store a portion of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, where most of the conservation work was done and led by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you're really impressed by the craftsmanship of the people who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the front and back, you will see a very large respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched" One week after the missing girls, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew Volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with a system of about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village requested the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 days to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in dangerous areas such as mountain slopes and Sawa.
Also, on the 27th, the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search were lost.
The police and fire department are planning to continue the search from 6:30 am on the 29th.
The first oral argument, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral argument of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters were seeking to invalidate the election.
As a result of the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for invalidation of the election because the value of one vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture compared to Fukui Prefecture, which had the lowest number of votes per member of the Diet in July this year.
In the first oral argument held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that "the value of one vote per person was unequal and unconstitutional."
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendant's side requested that the request be dismissed as "it should not be said that the issue of unconstitutionality was in a significant unequal state, but should be constitutional."
The judgment will be passed on October 30.

Mexican drug cartels, one third of the drug in the United States
Chicago Out Immediately after sunrise on the Chicago West Side, CBS News captured rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
Nearly 800 people died of overdose in Chicago last year.
McNight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named Nemecio Cervantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Chief investigator Matthew Donahew DEA in Mexico said, "Mencho is the DEA and, in fact, the top priority of the US Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in El Mencho were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartels, Harrisco Nueva Henellación (CJNG), are involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel has sold "a large amount of" cocaine, methane phetamine, and phentanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From the deaths of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho is not punished and is responsible for his own empire.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by drug cartels.
According to Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing when handled.
At the manufacturing site, the bag of cocaine is stamped by the smuggler.
More than a third of the drug was produced by El Mencho.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively capture the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Tennoji Zoo (Tennoji Ward, Osaka City) held a farewell party for the only male koala "ARK" in Osaka Prefecture.
In mid-October, it was decided to rent a zoo in the UK for 10 years, and it is likely not to return.
thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of Koala, where eucalyptus grew, spared their part.
He is 12 years old.
Coala's breeding life spans 15 to 20 years, and it is thought that he will complete Tenju in the UK where he married.
Mr. Hideki Tsujimoto (40), the keeper in charge, cried out, "It is impossible to put the curtain down on the raising of the koala, full of gratitude."
Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the old days
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent State of Play announcement, Sony announced the release date of its sequel, Last of As, February 2020.
Some of the video games of this new action game were shown to fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
The last-of-a-part 2 has been released on multiple discs since the PSwan era.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortidog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"The story is magnificent and complicated in a different way than the previous one," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell the story that there were so many characters.
I didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but it eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game was so spectacular that it did not enter a single Blu-ray, and it was two discs.
In addition, Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
There is no need to ruin this surprise, but Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic Notic Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will know more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019, including the aforementioned Notty Dog game.
MLB The Show 19 will be released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like Last of As Remastered and want to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replicas, and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Save" Council Trial Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th, on Noto Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, the Notoshima Regional Development Council (Notoshima Regional Development Council) was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings, and food crossed the Somachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
There were also products that were sold more than expected and quickly replenished, and residents asked for continued "help" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including general vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even elderly people who live alone, a total of vegetables such as potato salad and kinpira gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
In the town of Suso, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't think it would sell so much."
Mr. Mitsue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope I will continue."
The user also ordered "I want to have coffee that I drip by myself rather than canned coffee."
The council will consider what was requested.
There is currently only one convenience store in Notoshima where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to help "shopping weak."
Until December, the 20 town councils in the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to provide additional $100 million to the affected population.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by droughts have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been significantly revised to simplify.
In addition, approximately $340 million will be recorded as a drought-affected resident support organization, and eligible farmers will receive up to $3,000 emergency assistance.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to $100 million in drought relief funds for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted over $7 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife's family in Texas.
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 of killing Stephen, Katie Stay, and four of his five children.
The authorities said on July 9, 2014, Haskell was pushed into the residence of Mr. Stay and questioned the whereabouts of his wife Melanie Haskell.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Stephen Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old son, 9 and 7 years old daughter died.
Only one of his family, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stie, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed from office until Monday.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook her voice with anger resonated with the leaders of each country.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and frustration all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people attended in over 150 countries.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will start in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than two degrees, if possible, to one or five degrees.
All participating countries shall take measures in accordance with each other without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather conditions, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, which are pointed out to be related to global warming, occur in various places.
In order to achieve a faster pace of global warming, one step is required to strengthen our efforts.
At the summit, which was realized by the call of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal of virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new targets, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become conspicuous.
Japan's strong criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming at zero emissions of 50 years is large.
There was no opportunity for Japan to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who demonstrated Japan's efforts at environmental-related meetings, said at a conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The damage that cannot be discussed is nothing more than the "replacement of issues" that the person himself refutes.
There is no longer a grace to combat global warming, and the international community must respond to the common crisis of humanity in a manner consistent.
We can't expect the effectiveness of each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
In order not to take away the future, adults should act.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The U.S. Army's research results have led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and time-keeping capabilities that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Distributed Quantum Information Center of the Army Research Institute of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Innsbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and measured in one, even if one quantum bit is physically far from the other, the measurement results in the other are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is twice as large as the past, and it is also a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, which published results in Nature's Quantum Information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bitpoints in entangled states despite the large distances.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum internet.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
The entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and then excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
First, the light particles were sent through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, the optimal value for long-distance transfers - the standard wavelength of current long-distance communications.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
In the measurement results, atoms and photoparticles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured simultaneously with high-quality "clock" quantum bits, which lead to the realization of an entangled network of long-range atomic clocks.
The large entangled clock network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate position measurement, navigation and time-keeping applications."
