Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina to protest the Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the region's only nuclear power plant near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstrators of the Bosnian town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the site of the barracks in Trugovska Gola, and vow to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the Kursico nuclear power plant.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take away a healthy future," and "Don't stop it firmly."
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grad, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss the expansion of waste treatment facilities next week.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility or to pay for the waste of Croatia that Slovenia would be treated at newly constructed facilities.
Croatian Minister of Environmental Protection and Energy Tomislav Chorich told the announcer that Croatia is also facing problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials, and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would find another location on its own near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the pockets of Bosnian trousers - the Turkovska gola - be the best place in Croatia?"

PayPay salesman "I'm on the Wave" "Earning cashless" wake up "I'm on the Wave" Will the waves swell (Tokai TV) - Yahoo!
Tax increase starting in October.
In line with this, the country will start a cashless point reduction project.
Reducing up to 5% to reduce the cooling of consumption is "cashless."
[See in the image] Just before the tax increase ... shops and businesses "cacheless introduction"
So what's happening now is "Run-in Introduction."
This is a cashless store that was previously a cash business.
We were close to the installation site.

"Okakiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular shop operated by Takeyoshi confectionery, and there are more than 100 kinds of okaki and arashi in the shop.
Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users, visited Tatsushin on this day.
PayPay Yasuda: Is there any payment method other than cash?
Mr. Shinmi, President of Takeyoshi Co., Ltd.: "No, we only accept cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I wonder if the cash register rotation will be faster because it will not be possible to receive the tsurisen, and if you get used to it, it will be easier than cash."
To date, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce 20% of the usage by points.
Although the number of users has increased dramatically, Yasuda is an "employee man" who sells the introduction of PayPay to customers, that is, stores.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also heard from Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's a peak now.If you're not able to talk to me before you jump in, or if you're going to do a consumer reduction business together, I'm going to register a member store and I'm riding a wave now quite a bit."
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the national consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave us the reason to ride the waves in the country's Consumer Reduction Project.
With the consumption tax increase from October, the government introduced a system to reduce up to 5% of the shopping amount to consumers to prevent the cold consumption.
As in "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before tax increases.

What is the representative Münchhausen syndrome that appeared in The Politician of Netflix?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are sick.
The Politician is broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, the president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinnes Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness where parents behave as if they were physically or mentally ill, even though the person under the protection is not really sick.
There are many different types of conditions, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is falsely believed to be a disease of himself.
However, the surrogate Münchhausen syndrome is clearly false that others under their protection are ill.
It is also known as FII or FII, a type of child abuse.
It is a rare symptom, but usually parents exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if a child is sick.
What are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following cautions.
The child is healthy, but if he is sick, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make the child feel sick, such as by mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Excessive medications and other drugs cause symptoms of disease.
How general is Muhnhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that there were 89 cases of 100,000 people in two years.
what should we do if we suspect child damage?

Nigeria: Police raided Kaduna schools, rescued 300 children
Kaduna - The Kaduna State Police conducted a forced investigation yesterday at Imam Ahmad ibn Humbal School in Rain Maidhuven Tunma, Igabi, arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
Police said the children were inhumane, but the school denied this claim.
A resident who calls himself a school pastor, the chef, says, "The children are all in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering the school, parents signed their consent.
Parents come to deliver meals to their children every day, so they know what kind of environment they are in.
I was very surprised to have closed the school after the police arrived, forced the kids to flee, and all the food the parents delivered left.
It's unfair to have parents who can testify to the terrible environment the police have said."
He adds that Abdullahman, former head of the Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
It is also said that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhumane environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage gully suit with leaves grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind and dragged her into the bush while attending a school in Central Coast, Virginia.
After that, the man made the girl vulnerable to trees and sexually assaulted her.
Immediately after the arrest, a house search warrant was issued and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges of assault and grooming and sexual abuse against another 11-year-old girl.
The 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking along the path and saw a man armed with a large tree branch and a knife suddenly coming out of the bush.
When the girl asks him to stop, stop, and stop, the man puts a head lock on the girl and forcibly takes her into the woods.
The man told the girl, "Don't speak loud.
He said, "I'm going to have to deal with the pain."
The man had a knife on his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused it for nearly an hour.
When a man spilled the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at work around 9:30 a.m., with several phone calls and phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood on his clothes with mud, grass, and trees, and was involved in street violence, and when he chased the driver to the bush, he claimed that he had fallen by mud.
The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, warning IT representatives that AI development is based on public interests
On Friday, Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors that the competition for artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital development would increase social injustice if not accompanied by ethical assessments of public interests.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference, where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethics met.
A few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited to the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age."
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increased mechanical work, while case studies were conducted on gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand and the response of social media companies during the atrocities.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines freed workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely too much on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
The Pope warned, "If technological progress could cause increasingly prominent inequality, it would not be the right true progress."
If the so-called technological advances of humans are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will go back to a certain kind of savage based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they would like to take advantage of the expertise of the participants in the conference to find a person who can become a future adviser to the Catholic Church on the high-tech field.

Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerle were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When the lawsuit came in contact, Sharad Powerle's name was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The agency's Executive Office (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Ajit Powerl, former Deputy Minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an Executive Bureau report comparable to the first police report was registered by the Central Authority.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report, charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit came in contact, Sharad Powerl's name was nowhere.
An executive lawsuit and suspicion that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name emerged and who referred it."
Anna Hazare, a critic of Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazare, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this incident."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the joint bank, and questioned the timing of filing a lawsuit just weeks before the October 21 Maharashtra parliamentary election.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, declaring that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
NCP referred to the action by the Executive Bureau as a political abbreviation.

Stepping the accelerator pedal will eliminate accidents!
Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driver error.
In particular, accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistakes by elderly drivers are on an increasing trend.
In particular, when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes a panic, and sometimes the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
There are new vehicles equipped with safety driver support functions that cover such errors, but there are also rearing devices that can be attached to unattended vehicles.
After-sales parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapid start prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and the pedal is stepped at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot is to inform pedal mistakes from a new perspective.
It is to avoid pedal mistakes with "an alarm."
The system generates "an alarm sound" when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of stepping on the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
It is to react to the sound and encourage the accelerator to return, and to avoid rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping.
It is difficult to understand the change in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is effective for elderly drivers who can hear it.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is affordable, and it is also attractive that you need to set up.
[Ashimo Watching-kun] The World Wing was launched in mid-September by Ashimo Watching-kun, an accelerator brake prevention device.
It can also be used when retreating (back) without moving forward.
When the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped in during the advance and retreat from the stop (and less than 10Km/h), the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected and the accelerator opening is suppressed electrically.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, do not tell the signal from the accelerator, and control the sudden start by instantly turning it into a creep driving state (the state where the brake is removed in the D range).
It is also equipped with a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h or more at the back of the vehicle and force the vehicle to be cleaned.
Installation is possible only with capraon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Mayor Nakamura said, "I'm surprised that I haven't been to the whole Toba citizen yet, and I want to continue exchanges of mind."
[Saga Torrential rains] Sharing mothers' experiences while raising children | Saga News
"Haguhagu" (Representative of Tomoko Tanaka) held a discussion on the experiences and lessons learned from the Saga torrential rain disaster at Ariake Public House in Sakata, the town on July 27.
About 20 mothers who are raising children think about the form of disaster prevention suitable for each household and summarize their awareness and requests for local governments.
Sanosato Kusumoto (32) in Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked the nursery school suddenly lost their desire to go to the nursery school after the flood, and they were forced to stay overnight.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up the house and have not had enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can not panic and say "OK."
Mr. Yukari Ogushi (36) of Shiraishi-cho spent a night in a shelter town hall with four family members, including three-year-old children.
He said, "If you have a child who can't stay still, you will use your mind around you."
A woman in the center of Saga City (45), with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was soaked in water.
"I can't run away with five people," he said, "I'm going to spend my time at home as much as possible in a disaster and have food and a simple toilet.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Ms. Shinako Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a child of 6 and 8 years old, proposed that "the elementary school had a closed school e-mail the day before, but the nursery school had no communication network or email system.
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I don't know what it was like last time."I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
President Tanaka said, "I will think that the opinions presented will be conveyed to the government as an organization."
Relations between Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri, a female businessman, and inquiries to the police authorities.
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the scandal in office of Mayor of London as a violation of the Penal Code.
The Greater London Administration (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts of conduct" on suspicion that Mr. Arcuri had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists where there is information that indicates that a crime may have been committed," says GLA.
This was never proven.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate this.
The problem was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC was an institution that responded to the accusations issued by the police in England and Wales.
The problem was entrusted to the police supervisory authority because Johnson was in a position comparable to that of the Chief of Police at the time.
Johnson denied misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information about his relationship with Arcuri, despite claiming it was "unconfirmed."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it seems that the press had received preferential treatment for U.S. citizens who had emigrated to London seven years ago, paid £126,000 from public money during the mayor's time in London, and joined three foreign trade delegations with Johnson.
The government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to Hacker House, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked questions puzzled about the investigation process done before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "regular proper assessment" and that the company owns a British telephone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Aculi (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businesswoman was "public secret among the staff."
The GLA's move to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory authority touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence for any charge, and the prime minister has not been given an opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority prior to the news reports issued late Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will be able to see the political kyogen that was created by the amasama.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the friendship between Johnson and California businessmen supported by the London Department of Tourism and Regional Promotion was "public secret."
L&P's former staff stated that despite some who believed that the company was "untrustworthy" at that time, he had the privilege of attending trade-related talks abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Awakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, about the future prospects.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back over the last 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in 20 years of history.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the people involved, not to the history that has only been achieved by the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public is relieved of their concerns about money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operations do not yield results unless they walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result was a 20-year long-term long-term fund, and we believe it is because we continue to be a direct sales system that can deliver messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
Generally speaking, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box, but the "Sawakami Fund" has disclosed everything.
This is why you can trust us.
mack miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - A third man was arrested and charged for drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller of overdose of drugs last year.
According to court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling fake tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had previously held before he accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl in September of last year, but fenthanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is charged with supplying the drug to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold the drug to Miller.
According to a court record released on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Levis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is charged with delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against each case.
Walter, currently in custody, was placed under probation for a drug case in 2005, and was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutor in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the trial began due to the high likelihood of escape.
There was no immediate response to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the federal court on September 4, but the defense counsel refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller from Pittsburgh, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video to his Instagram account and published a song called "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with recent opioid drug abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, was also killed in 2016 due to drug overdose and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen rather than Steven.
more than 30 mobile games developed by nineyearolds in nigeria
The nine-year-old is using a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create a hide-and-do game.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats that come out of hiding places.
He learned how to make a game in a short intensive course.
Basil told CNN that he spent time building games when he was bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children like Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing many mobile games.
"When I was four years old, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, Basil's interest in game production increased.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was so absorbed in the game that I got a bit angry," his father said.
I was so frustrated that I said, "I'm always playing games, but what about making games myself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn how to make a game.
Basil-chan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, names his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at the Google Play Store.
The youth population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is achieved, young people like Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been recognized for creating robots that use program code to organize household chores.
In May, Akrobo won the 2019 Robofest Contest, a girls' high school team from Ghana who programmed boxed robots.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies has increased, and Basil and his children are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of fraud in the bribery investigation.
According to court documents submitted on Friday, it is likely that the former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely testifyed to federal agents investigating corruption in major political donors.
In the federal court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a fact-based document prepared as part of a judicial transaction and signed by Hayes' attorney, Hayes was aware of false statements against FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Hayes admits.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecution sued former Congressman Hayes for involvement in the insurance company's plan to fund the state's insurance director's election.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh, founder of insurance and investment companies, has donated over $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016, and has become the state's top political donor in recent years.
Lindbergh supported Republican principles and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked for a comment by email on Friday, but did not respond.
On Friday, Hayes' attorney, Carnes Davis, received an email asking for additional comments, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken to Cosey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a factual document, Hayes actually spoke with the State Insurance Supervisor about a request for personnel transfer from Lindbergh.
The prosecution also said that Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cosey, and that he had a direct bribe with his supervisor.
The indictment, published in April, claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to hold up to $2 million in his campaign to re-election in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported the alleged attempted bribery to federal agents and helped establish the case.
Cozy has no suspicions.
The indictment described in a conversation, including Lindbergh and Cosey, that Lindbergh co-owners instructed Hayes to send $2.5 million to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially argued that he would pay attention if he did so much money, but was eventually broken in the conversation.
In the indictment, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sent an email asking for more information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, trying to improve user's happiness, like! number hidden test plan
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users soon seem to like other people's posts!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, makes Good! an individual and only posters appear.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday, and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager, Mia Garrick, said the change was based on feedback from mental health professionals who thought the number of goodies would be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had very positive feedback from a number of affiliated bullying groups and mental health organizations."
It only removes numbers so that users can focus on the quality of interaction and content rather than the number of likes and reactions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more securely than they feel competitive.
Garrick stated that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights they had access to.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test was conducted, and it was too early to say that tests were conducted in the same way.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test will end or whether it will remain unchanged.
"There was initially positive feedback on the Instagram experience, but now it's a step to listen and learn," Garrick said.
Garrick, who is in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has very aggressive "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram users.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my mother's favorite bag of gold and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
It was the handcrafted parts of Cando that helped me.
when i gave up saying, don't sell anymore
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pla product.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, the price of the main body was significantly higher.
My mother said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver color.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Candu, I finally found it!
I was moved when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It is originally a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
We planned to use one at each end of the bag handle and bought two items.
The size of the ring is small, but if you line it up with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is attached immediately.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So I decided to put the ring in two sets.
The metal fittings were increased, but because of the lightweight parts, the weight was not a problem at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of sparkling parts has increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, an express train of JNR, is a temporary train from Hiroshima to Kumamoto, a 10-hour trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train inspired by the JNR express "Aso" = 28 days
People who enjoy a special train trip inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A temporary train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 people, including railway fans, boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station to Kumamoto Station.
Aso was a night train that connected Kumamoto and Tokyo between 1950 and 1980.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" by JR companies, the tour was organized by Japanese travelers.
The train consists of seven cars, including passenger cars and locomotives, and runs on the Sanyo, Chikuho and Kagoshima lines.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother's life imprisonment for the honor murder of kandir barochi, a Pakistani social media star.
Candir Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
One of Pakistan's most popular social media outlets, Candir Barochi's older brother, was convicted of murdering his sister on Friday, and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most popular "honorary murder" in Pakistan.
Baroch was strangled in July 2016 when he was famous for his selfie photography - which is not as big as Western standards, but was provocative in Pakistan, which is very strong in women's contempt.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
His brother said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, of course, that his sister's actions were "unforgivable," and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of the eastern city of Murtan was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshirar will be innocent in the Supreme Court," he said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Barochi's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of neglecting the rules of father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, who seek action against the spread of so-called "honorary murders."
Women have been burned, killed, stabbed or strangled by crimes such as choosing their own marriage partner - in Barochi's case, appraising their sexuality and humiliating their family.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisas and Deya laws allow perpetrators to be pardoned by relatives of the victim.
Three months after Barochi's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, it is up to the judge's discretion to determine whether murder is an honorable crime, and the killer can theoretically claim a different motive and may be pardoned.
In Baroch's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, his parents changed their minds and asked him to forgive him.
Due to international hatred of killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a bright red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although criticized and threatened, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the expression of oneself as an existence such as Kim Kardashian has opened up a new heaven and earth in a country considered to be a bold and political activity to improve the status of women.
The origins of "honorary" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely in South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

(From left) ASA Amami Sports Academy
[Okinagarabu General Bureau] The NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Sonoda and Amami City) and the Okinagara Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda and Chinamachi) signed a partnership for the promotion of remote island sports on February 25.
In addition to actively cooperating in projects implemented by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both groups mediate and send their own trainers and instructors for training related to sports and share information.
When a team of remote islands participates in a tournament outside the island, they work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association of Kagoshima Prefecture, which cooperates with the ASA during the prefectural and other tournaments on the mainland, we will provide support to prevent the performance of the athletes from falling due to fatigue during boat trips and consecutive nights.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, it is said that it will support players who come from outside the island by cooperating with local orthopedic hospitals and hospital officials.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held at Elabco in Chimei-cho, and President Sonoda and Maeda shook hands.
After that, both organizations co-hosted a training session with Athletic Trainer Yuichiro Hidaka.
Local sports boys, club leaders and parents learned how to use taping properly and how to prevent injuries.
Mr. Sonoda (52) said, "The purpose of the activities to eliminate the handicap of remote islands in terms of sports environment is common to each other, and there are many areas where we can cooperate.
Mr. Maeda (43) said, "It is very encouraging to have a partnership with a proven organization like ASA, and if you want to absorb good things to improve the sports environment for children in remote islands," he said.
Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a part.
In the first part (see the related article), Mr. Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko stick to the conventional "man's fantasy" and that pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, we talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool guy.
if you're bound by what you should do
In the first part, since "coolness" constantly evolves, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and behavior of people.
When I learn patterns, I think that in this case, the brain systematizes the behavior so that I can live in comfort.
I think I'm still evolving every day, apart from whether I'm "mote" or not.
So it's easy to live.
I taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit hard if you stick to the old pattern of "the university teacher is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will survive.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I talked about that in my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is.
"heavyness" and "authority" are things that come out naturally by admitting that person.
He doesn't want to be light.
It's hard to ask around yourself.
Isn't Takeshi doing this at the Cannes Film Festival?
Although he is light, his surroundings will be treated as "a wonderful film director."
Those who have a proven track record don't have to behave great.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," you cannot be light.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of position or age, "cute" for any man seems to be an excuse and salvation.
It is difficult to know what this "cute" is.
what is it?
Nigeria's illegal northwest, doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled to about 40,000 due to the intensifying violence in the last four months.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created, and by the end of this year, a new $35.5 million fundraiser will be needed in cooperation with each institution.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Bokoharam, an Islamic extremist organization that has been active in the northern part of Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Nigeria over the past ten months in Sokot, Zamfara and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"We often show the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok said to the press on Friday.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, robberies, murder and sexual violence were frequently occurring, and that raiders destroyed houses and worked on theft.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime groups in the area.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoharam and the West African branch of Islamic State, which was split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come by the name of the group," he says.

According to Polk County Court records, Marvin Escobar Orellana (31) was indicted for first-class murder in three cases under the false name of Marvin Eskibel Lopez, who was initially referred to as the police.
He claims not guilty.
According to the police, in Des Moines' house on July 16, he shot Rossibeth Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and son (5).
In court records, a new date of trial was decided on January 27 to give the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare.

He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.
The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising for header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own ad frame according to their requests.
This service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system in which multiple bidders (advertisers) compete in fair bidding to deliver high-priced ads to media operated by media companies preferentially.
As a solution that is transparent for media companies and is expected to improve profitability, it is being introduced mainly by major media.
In the past, SSP has been providing advertising frames through SSP.
In recent years, in order to respond to requests from advertisers that "we want to deliver to certain ad frames that have high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP started in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, to directly purchase advertising frames to meet the needs of advertisers.
This time, the introduction of LFP will be expanded by supporting header binding.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP header binding allows them to participate in bidding directly for header binding target ad frames, which is expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, because the target media company is limited, the advertisement frame of each product and the delivery destination according to the brand image is secured, preventing brand value damage.
One of the advantages of media companies is that the solution to manage the code of each bidder company, called the " wrapper solution," which LFP promotes collaboration, enables initiatives that meet the expectations of the introduction of media companies.

Two months of suspension of Assistant Professor Yamagata University in Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On July 27, Yamagata University announced that a male assistant professor in his thirties at Yonezawa Campus (Yonezawa City) was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the General Affairs Department of the University of Tokyo, Assistant Professors of the University of Tokyo, from around October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, were emotional and repeatedly bullied by inappropriate words.

Cabinet Revolts Calls Boris Johnson to reduce demands for EU withdrawal and to make compromises with the EU The Sun
Now that only three weeks have passed since the EU summit meeting, there is a growing concern around the prime minister that the prime minister might be out of time to withdraw significant concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion that seeks to lower the demands of withdrawal from the EU and compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses on the Irish border have been jammed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative as "impossible."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany will propose a compromise proposal on the ground, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the end of the Conservative annual convention in Manchester next week.
They would demand that the prime minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings, and claim that the EU will accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One Cabinet member said that the Supreme Court's ruling that the closing of Congress was illegal on Tuesday was "a warning."
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use whatever is available to him.
Even if it becomes radical, there is no effect, and Cummings' plan clearly fails.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to implement the previous prime minister's agreement, if not yet.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are so many, and everyone is trying to end this.
If we postpone it, Boris is over, and we are all over.
Sir John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a bitter speech, said: "The prime minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to form an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Whales, and discussing with the people on the streets - as if the election campaign was full-fledged."
The prime minister's press yesterday admitted that the agreement was still a long way ahead, and said, "No one can think of it - if you achieve the goal, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which would force a three-month postponement in case of a non-agreed withdrawal, would greatly weaken our negotiating position in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue moving forward despite the bill's passage."
The European Union Delegation Minister Stephen Berkeley returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the TV world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by TV station bosses that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was so nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before I took over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone on the TV-am team and to see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget Ann Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis that morning.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my favorite place is here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbride, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scotland branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began a program named Lorraine.
In celebration of her 35th anniversary, she broadcast a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
" passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity" were the keys to survival in the television industry, and the moderator added, "You have to put it in your work."
You must be honest and sincere.
To do what you should do, to get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck me, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting was "very painful."
The day after that terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think many families of children who were killed or injured watched us live broadcast the show from Danbourne.
Pam Ross, who was killed by her mother and five-year-old daughter Joanna, personally told me that she wanted to see me, so we spoke at her house for hours.
Not taking it all on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gary McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very hard" and that "we really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets that do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of a presidential post from former President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to fears that it might be a trap to refute the military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede President while negotiations between Mugabe and the Defense Forces continued.
However, Chiwenga declined the offer, not because of anxiety, but because he saw the intention of Mugabe to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of his administration in a coup.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirmed that officials were senior officials of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who had been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munnagagwa," it is said that intense negotiations were held at that time.
Mugabe, who realized he was losing power, told the government officials that he had made contact with Chiwenga by an envoy.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three persons.
It was reported that President Spokesman George Charamba, then head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Nepera, and Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Muconoli were involved in the negotiations.
Gideon Gono, the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was one of Mugabe's delegated roles in delivering the president's seat to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga alone.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death than he was alive, attempted to denounce military action by the African Union, seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the presidency to the former CDF was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was a wasteful act to start fatigue in part of the late president's family and to save the dangerously rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, there were a few political aims of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If there was anything to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but I want you to remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President, Mugabe, hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and crush the claims of the commanders claiming that he did not break the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the whole situation, would decide whether to position it as a coup, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe moved when he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had penetrated the presidential house called Blue Roof, they would not point guns to the citizens.
At that point, Mugabe said he wanted two things: to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
A powerful metaphorical expression was used in the words of an envoy (Gono) telling the president's desperate message: "Is Tiri Bemaqwapa Macwapa (we belong to the camouflage group or military unit) and we are not politicians or political competitors."
The Army told the other commanders of the region that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coup and successors, Mugabe attempted to bring back Munnagagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed assistance from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at the time, the key South Africans in this process had refused to intervene, but, as repeatedly threatened behind it, clarified that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military had invaded the presidential house.
"Just because it wasn't supported by President Putin and African leaders, it didn't come to fruition," the sources state.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals for nuclear ban ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On June 26 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and Michiko Takeuchi (63), the granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing, delivered a speech and appealed for support for the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
Five new states ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and 32 countries and regions were ratified.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech, expressing strong concern that in recent years there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

China needs strong leadership, otherwise collapse - policy documents
Prior to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In the White Paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party's administration 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will face divisions and collapses, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the repression of the democratic movement in Beijing in 1989 as necessary for national stability.
President Xi Jinping, who is the leading figure in the world's second largest economic power commemorative ceremony, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since he took power in late 2012 and has tightened the human resistance against the party.
Xi has also overseen military modernization programs threatening the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export the development model of its own country, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, and that it merely seeks peace rather than supremacy.
Among the genes of Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control of other people.
In modern times, China was bullied by the powerful, and war and chaos left a deep scar with that pain; China would never take the pain he experienced to others.
China is facing difficult issues such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in China's Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "abandon" its core interests, nor allow its security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"The threat of trade wars and rising tariffs do not lead to any problem-solving," White Paper states.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and momentum of strong economic development.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China has the power to face difficulties, turn crisis into opportunities and open a new world.
He added that the United States should take the development of China calmly, as China has no idea of countering the United States and does not want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and it is less likely that China will stop its development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from director Hirata and director Kaneko.
Yokohama Taka, a well-known high school baseball player who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that he had dismissed Toru Hirata (36) and Masa Kaneko (42).
In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as director and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.
As for director Hirata and director Kaneko, the local newspaper reported on the 26th that there was a rumor about baseball club members.
When the two students heard about the situation, Director Hirata grabbed the student's neck, and Director Kaneko admitted a part of the riot.
In addition, based on the results of the interviews with 66 students, the two confirmed the facts again, and they were dismissed on 28 January because they generally accepted the facts.
In the summer of 2015, Motochika WATANABE (74), who raised pitchers such as Daisuke MATSUSAKA (currently Nakanichi), left Yokohama.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
From summer 16 to summer 16 he played in Koshien for three consecutive years, and this spring he also participated in Senbatsu.
However, this summer, when he was defeated by Sagamihara in the semifinals, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semifinals in the fall, and the next spring he participated in Senbatsu was hopeless.
The Spice Girls' Mel C, after eating disorders, banned dieting in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom, from his experience of eating nothing but fruit and vegetables for many years, admitted that diet was prohibited at home.
Sporty spices have long been "excessive exercise" without eating well under the pressure of a member of a global pop group, and have subsequently been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by his daughter Scarlett's child-rearing, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"Scarlett is now 10 years old, and I'm gradually becoming more conscious of his appearance," says Mel.
However, because I experienced eating disorders, I was able to be very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habit.
As a member of the Spice Girls, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that in the 1990s, a "bad" comment on himself, still in front of SNS, led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, became more and more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin," Mel said.
I didn't feel well, and it lasted for about a few years."
Same-sex marriage justice judgment The opportunity to broaden diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch made a decision to approve the case in which 'in fact marriage' (internal marriage) that conforms to marriage could be established between same sex.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, and there is a system in which local governments such as Sapporo City certify same-sex partnerships, which are not legally effective in Japan.
The decision was based on the fact that two women were actually married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to grant legal protection to same-sex couples.
The same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Registration Law, and lawsuits are filed in five district courts, including Sapporo, to seek compensation for damages to the country as unconstitutional.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system to recognize the various forms of families.
The women lived together for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the United States, but the plaintiffs filed for damages to their former partners after they were found guilty.
The decision was based on the results of the two living together and recognized "the reality that is different from the actual marriage between men and women."
It is a revolutionary decision to extend the recognition of factual marriages that have the same rights as marriage in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution, which defines marriage as "only based on the agreement of both sexes."
It is said that "the same-sex marriage was not expected at the time of establishment, so it is not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
While the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various parts of the country.
On the other hand, because same-sex marriage was not allowed, the problem remained that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection differ from that of men and women."
It may not be difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while recognizing the same reality as between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, 70 percent of people believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a legal spouse, so there are still few restrictions, such as not receiving preferential treatment in the tax system and not having joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only marriage between same-sex couples but also the expansion of legal rights for actual marriage.
to the trial and jury trial of former athletes indicted for rape against multiple women.
A jury trial is held for former Delaware University baseball players accused of sexual assault on multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
A 21-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted after she drove Conaway home.
The two met after three weeks at the meeting site Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018, one of them.
The prosecution claimed that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women were inconsistent and misrepresented, and that women would regret having physical relations.
[Hiroshima] Director Ogata noted his departure, saying "It's the next season that you take the pennant." - Yahoo! News
In the third place, Hiroshima was defeated in the final game of this season, and the possibility of his own entry into CS was eliminated.
If the player wins all three games, they will be eliminated.

However, when asked by the press about the matter after the ceremony, he said, "It's not finished yet, so it's all."
[Dospo] Ota is the 4th and 20th most self-executive after his transfer to Hokkaido Shimbun.
He became a "returner" to the seniors.
Four times in one lead, he hit his 20th home run with a liner on the left.
He reached the number of home runs he was aiming for, and he said, "I stopped receiving this number and tried to do it again, and it became a big one."
The director's intention was also firm.
This was the first time a four-year contract was signed.
He said, "I put it in number four so I could swing.
Dada responded to his expectations, saying, "I felt that way, and as a result I entered the game, I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the ideal 4 statues is Abe, a giant who retired from active duty this season.
"The 4th is the core that leads us to victory, and the 4th is the team's 4th and the 4th seniors I've seen with the giants were the same."
Among them, "Mr. Abe's figure comes to mind the most, he was a reliable person, and he looked at his back and became his style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, obviously in videos
Sydney Harbour is one of Sydney's largest tourist attractions, bringing $2109 million to the Australian economy every year, with opera houses, Circular Key, Luna Park and some of the most famous Harbor Bridges.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the dirtyest places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with shells, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes lost by someone, and even animal corpses - all due to rainwater flowing through the road.
The biggest factor that clogs the waterway is plastic.
Coincidentally, the video was released on September 27 of the World Tourism Day, and Dr. Katherine Dafoon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
Although its appearance is certainly beautiful, it is one of the most polluted estuaries of the coastline of Japan.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour is expected to flow into the waterway, most of which flow through the rainwater drain into Sydney Harbour.
"There were heavy rains several times, but Sydney Harbour was... quite tragic," Dr. Daffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited in the seabed.
"If you don't actually go under the sea level, you don't know what's there," said Richard Nichols, owner of the Dive Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste each year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what's under the surface of the water), I think everyone will be really surprised.
Over half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The other half is plastic at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing right under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of Ocean Protect's founders and director, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles better, and eventually flows into the sea, so you have to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30% of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
However, we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old appearance, but it is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, coincided with the release of the video funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of a broader awareness of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also stated that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed were increasingly concerned about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Plant was demolished in October | Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun
The chimney of the former Karatsu Power Station, which began demolition work in October, is Futako, Karatsu City.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin dismantling the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Plant (oil-fired power plant) in Futako, Karatsu City.

The original three were removed in 1991.
One of the chimneys is broken down by a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months for each decomposition and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine buildings and boilers have not been demolished.
A man in his 60s who runs a restaurant nearby said, "When I look back from afar and see a chimney, it is like a symbol that made me feel like I came back to Karatsu.

It is located in a corner of Karatsu Higashi Port, and has an area of approximately 225 thousand square meters.
Due to the proximity of Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three people, including nine electric cars, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.

I am now (CBC Television) - Yahoo! News
This time, Maya Takahashi, a monthly commentator on CBC TV's Chant!, spoke about his master.
the advice of the master who saved my rotten self.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is more like a master than a father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
It's not what I'm doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to gain knowledge, and what is important as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of a TV station, but when I was told that I was a connor or a busaik, my father said, "I thought it was a connor, but it wasn't so.
Then, around the 2nd to 3rd year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty woman can do it," and even when I did not get motivated because I wanted to do the work I wanted to do, even when my heart was rotten "Who can do the work is hard work.If so,"I asked everyone to do it, but I was glad that I was in charge of Mama.
i learned from my father's performance naturally.
There may be many people who have never seen me read the news, but in fact, I've been exposed to the news through the narration of BS and news programs since I joined TV stations.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when I read the news manuscript, and I was happy and confident that Mr. Matsuko Deluxe had praised me for being good at reading the news.
When I read the news, I feel it's important and sensed.
The punctuation points, how to take the breath and how to interact with each other have been cultivated by watching my father's stage, movies, TVs and period dramas as a child.
In other words, I think that my father's work on variety shows and how to deal with them is thanks to various experiences of my childhood.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020
The FIA announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18 cards.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship, along with Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship, is one of the four World Championships under the jurisdiction of the FIA.
Since 1973, it has been the world's highest rally championship with history and tradition, and the competition is said to be the toughest car championship because it is not only closed public roads (paved roads), but also gravel roads and snow roads.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufactures title for the second season since 1999 and became a big topic.
This time, the Japan Round Invitation Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.), the governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Mr. Hideaki Omura, Governor of Aichi Prefecture
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with stakeholders to ensure that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in the fall of 2020 as the center of motorsports representing Japan, and that it will be a big appeal to the world."
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japanese round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports tournament in the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all."
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
In addition, Mr. Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Federation of Motor Sport Promotion Members, commented on the Japan Round.
The WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya City, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City, Shitara Town) and Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ena City).
The main venue has been announced to use the "Love - Earth Expo Memorial Park (Nagakute City: commonly known as Morikoro Park) " which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 test event will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is Tasmanian devil the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmanian devil may be the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient care.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells camouflage.
Researchers found that the same process occurred in Tasmania Devil and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will lead to new ways of treating cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy could significantly alter their treatment for cancer.
It may also be the key to addressing deadly facial tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils near extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camfurage, causing markers to no longer react and immune systems to no longer attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and melkel cells.
Peter McCallum researcher Mark Dawson said, "What is very important in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Traditional therapies may be reused to reactivate markers, or proteins known as MHCs, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers hope that this discovery will eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils where similar cases of cancer cells escape detection.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process occurs in humans and Tasmanian devil cancer," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
But if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, they may be useful for controlling tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered and amazed the solar system, 30 light-years away from Earth, where giant Jupiter-shaped planets orbit around small stars called red dwarfs.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting its main star, the red dwarf, was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting around them.
However, in this case, the size of stars and planets is not much different, the researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12 percent the size of the Sun, but the planet orbiting around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, led the study published in the journal Science.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed primarily of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperatures.
The GJ3512 is not only considerably smaller than our Sun, it is almost the same size as the giant planet and only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is very low at about 3800 degrees Celsius (6380 degrees Celsius/3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why I have a reddish color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining its elliptical orbit.
Planets are produced from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust that produced their own orbiting stars.
In the most powerful planetary formation model known as the "core accumulation" model, the object is formed from solid particles in the disk, and the attraction created by the egg of the planet causes the surrounding gas to become the atmosphere.
A conflict model called a self-gravity instability model may explain this unusual planetary system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star may have been slightly larger and less temperature than was thought," Morales said.
Since the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense regions may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a mame dip containing a stimulant, was charged to his colleagues.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is accused of having his coworkers eat a dip of beans containing a stimulant.
On Thursday, Albani's Cassandra Annie Medina Hernández (38) was charged with the alleged transfer of methane fetamine and regulatory drugs to others for Class B felony.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit obtained from OregonLive.com, a suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County sheriff to taste it a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dip.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phetamine before, "After eating some mouths, I thought it tasted strange, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach got worse and her legs swelled.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, at a local hospital where a woman had gone, soy dip could have contained methane phetamine.
According to The Smoking Gunn, another Sliftway employee told Medina Hernández that he had "druged" the victim's food, while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message saying he had accidentally put methane fetamine in the bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows Medina Hernández turning his camera back and clinginging behind a microwave, but pulling something out of the brazier.
After that, he stood up and wiped his nose, walked toward the table and put a bean dip in a small paper dish.
Police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff, for now, did not think there were customers who had contaminated food.
Medina Hernández was detained in Marion County jail instead of bailing $250,000.
According to The Smoking Gunn, Medina Hernández's long-term arrest record has a history of felony by assault, robbery, spoofing, transfer of methane phetamine, theft, possession of methane phetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "The Challenge Can be organized" President of JR Tokai, attaching importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on July 27, Shin Kaneko, President of JR Tokai, reiterated his attitude toward early construction, stating that "it is better to separate the issues that arise in consultation with Shizuoka Prefecture in relation to the decrease in the flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the South Alps tunnel of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen, and that it is better to separate things that should be done before the construction starts."
More specifically, he said, "We will talk at the meeting place and at the front stage."
Mr. Kaneko said, "When you organize a lot of problems, it's not easy to start construction, I think it's possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea."
The county is concerned that the spring water from the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the recognition that "If there is something that can be realistic, but I think it is difficult to think from the safety side of construction."
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the route change mentioned was "not possible."
President Kaneko pointed out three locations in Minami Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station, which are particularly time-consuming for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Administrative and Social News|Saga Shimbun
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced the name of the hospital on March 26 that five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture need to be reorganized and integrated.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in Japan, and three have already been integrated and relocated.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu City Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital in Taramachi, Fujitsu County.
Of these, Takyu City Hospital and Kojo Municipal Hospital are planning to build a new hospital in Higashi-Takyu-cho, Takyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating in surplus for several years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi emphasized that "As a town, we have the idea of operating alone and collaborating with hospitals in neighboring cities, and hospitals must be left absolutely for residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The administrative director of Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "We do not hear the contents from the prefecture," and concluded that "We will actively participate in the regional medical concept coordination meeting of the prefecture and respond to it based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Organization for Promotion of Regional Medical Functions (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not a mechanical decision to determine the direction of public hospitals, but a request was made at the Regional Medical Design Coordination Conference in each prefecture to review them again."
"We would like to hear from the parties about the future operation of the hospital.
In some cases, we may ask you to review your medical courses and to further reduce your sickbed."

Secrets of the Royal Family: The surprise and frequent use of the Royal Navy aircraft
The Royal Family must travel hundreds of times throughout the world as part of its official duties.
In most cases, it is easy to use private machines that move royal families around the world for important events and appearances.
Of course, there is a privilege to have a private aircraft.
You don't have to be in the long line of entry and entry, you don't have to limit the number of baggage, and the Royal Family seems to be able to invite guests, including unexpected passengers, as much as you like.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, only Queen and Prince Philip are frequent customers of royal aircraft.
During the "Royal Flight Secrets" program, the Queen's former flight attendant revealed that many of her hairy guests, along with her family, were frequently on board.
Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, like most important royal customers, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggie Dog Privileges are famous, and it is not surprising to request a cute pet to travel together.
Queen Elizabeth loved dogs since she was a child, and it is said that she had more than 30 coggie dogs.
In 2007, she had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linette, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, there were five Cockerspaniel bisto, oxo, flash, pick, and span, plus four Daxfunt and Coggie mix dogs cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The staff on the Royal Air Force will be busy.
The Royal Staff had been seen asking the dogs to leave the grass before boarding, and Seals continued.
I've never been in an accident.
The show also found that the Queen's official travel packages were known for shocking amounts.
According to the Narrator, "There were 12 tons of Queen's luggage on a 44,000-mile Commonwealth tour in 1953."
It can be understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
However, the queen does not like fashion.
The Marquess of Cambridge are also said to have their own preferences when carrying their own clothes, and in Uwasa, they take one seat per dress.

In the first wave of Republicans leaping in Deep South, Jack Edwards, a retired Alabama state senator who served ten federal legislators, died on Friday.
Edward was reported by his bereaved family to have died at Fairhope's home after suffering from pancreatic cancer.
As Republicans gained momentum in Deep South, many Republicans in Alabama were elected to the federal legislature, but Edwards was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1965 as one of its first wave.
Edwards served ten terms in Congress.
According to the announcement made by the bereaved family, Edwards recently asked what kind of world he wanted to leave to his grandchild's generation and said he wanted to return to the reibushi.
According to his family, "I want my grandchildren to grow in a country that has regained reverence for daily conversation and efforts to solve the problems of my country."
Governor Kay Ibii said that Edwards served the state and state with the highest honor.
He also said that he plans to hold a half flag at the Alabama State Capitol to express his condolences.
"Mr. Edwards was a true public servant and the largest politician in Alabama.
My state lost one of the best politicians."

That's why it's my biggest advice to spend time and not rush to do anything.

Trump hotel owner holding a complaint to suitability, liquor sales license.
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Board of Alcohol and Beverage Auditors dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel due to questioning the suitability of the owner.
On Wednesday, three MPs, two former judges and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on a state law that requires the applicant's "suitability" to obtain a liquor license.
In the first appeal filed in the summer of last year, he accused President Trump of assault and repeated fraud, claiming he violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time that an appeal was made to renew the permit.
The honey collected by Bentley's Flying Bees is the first harvest!
How is the taste of honey collected by Flying Bees bred at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, a fixed bee was launched on the crew's premises in Bentley, UK, and honey was first harvested in September of the same year.
More than 100 honey bees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the site of a factory where cars were assembled?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honeys produced by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers watched the bees from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains as they were gathering honey from various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities through its Crew Plant and our business to become the top sustainable luxury car manufacturer, and is part of this.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully received, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the amount of bentree honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to fulfill our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million honey bees, Flying Bees, were launched.
In September of the same year, one summer passed, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was placed on a centrifugal separator, filtered the fallen honey, and then bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The label was designed by Louise McCallum, the designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we would like to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey in scones and other places.
The Cleveland Police, a series of scandalous reports, is the worst in Britain.
The police, who continued the scandal, were labeled as the worst in Britain by the inspector.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police Department said that "heavy deterioration" continued.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing a new demand for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect the socially vulnerable.
Phil Gomley of the Police Directorate said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
Mike Wiel, Chief of Police, resigned in January less than a year before taking office, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal activities.
Lieutenant Simon Herwood, last year, went to the Investigation Commission for Illegal Practices because of his colleague's involvement in sexual acts.
He resigned from the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is the official verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Home Affairs intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I have full responsibility for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr was "criminalized," and impeachment had to be settled.
Nobody knows what will happen.
Currently, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate."
"I'm going to do a job that I'm starting to do based on the time it takes to find facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked President Vladimir Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, who had been nominated for the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to the call records, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Giuliani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was the national security attorney of the Ministry of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before the formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of political fund violations.
In response to Barr's question of what to testify, Pelosi stated on Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee would decide who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that he thought he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, referring to Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the July telephone talks with the Ukrainian president.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision on the handling of this accusation.
Pelosi said he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower who was informed that Trump attacked the whistleblower as a spy on Thursday and hinted that he had been treated differently in the past.
The president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president said a terrible thing about the person who could have provided information to the whistleblower is a significant loss of the government's balance."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that Trump would formally impeach Trump on suspicion of putting pressure on foreign leaders for political gain and noted a historic step.
The call was included in a statement released on Thursday, in which the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his authority to "see intervention" in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-grade computer systems and replace them with special confidential information systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Bentek, driving ban by speed violation
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, is likely to be banned from driving.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu is concerned about the composition of the jury.
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and board member of Sécondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the upcoming GFA elections.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davids, and expressed dissatisfaction with it.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu stated that the chairman had a stake in the results of the review process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The review committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside who has no prior interest in the relationship with each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osay Kwak Parma about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4 after taking office at the GFA Accra Secretariat on Thursday, September 19.
The chairman is Frank Davis, a corporate governance consultant, and the chairman is Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Emmanuel Darkwer.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Appocavi, sports director and lawyer.
A survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered that the minimum wage raised by the government should be 1,000 yen.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and only 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded that they "approved" to raise the yen to 1,000 yen per hour, including information-related (100 percent), construction (70.6%), and wholesale (61.7%).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink and accommodation.
The representative of the meeting said, "Although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with high part-time and hourly wages, there are many companies that think it is difficult to secure human resources and increase labor costs."
On the other hand, the average amount paid by companies that responded that they could raise was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, 61.3% of regular employees hired new graduates, 54.5% mid-term employment, and 15.4% of non-regular employees were employed.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (new graduation 13.3%, middle school 37.5%) and construction industry (new graduation 24.1%, middle school 38.1%) were struggling.
A total of 86 and 4% of the respondents said they had problems in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, they said, "The low profile of the company."
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the second graduate (department within three years after graduation) and mid-career recruitment.
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied, "It is already approved."
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one-third of the total showed acceptance.
64.4% were "not admitted" companies, with construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%) and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the Australians
Justin Tiplic said, "It's a show now," when Wales is heading for the upcoming World Cup Tennozan and Australia.
If Wales wins Wallabeads, they will be the hottest winner in Pool D, and will likely be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, which has played 15 games, wins 14 against Wales, Tiplic and his team will be the best eight straight line against England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to try and win at the top of the group and end," said Tipric, a Welsh Franker.
The fight against Australia had been tough, but it was good to win last fall.
I think Australia is quite blaming me to repay my debt, but I will do my best to win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And now I'm here, it's a real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and has won only 32 years ago.
And under the supervision of Warren Gutland, all three Southern Hemisphere heavyweight teams won only seven out of 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was one of the top players to play at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
I'm sure the game was tough, maybe, but I don't know.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so it seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
The key to Welsh victory is the break-down battle between Michael Hooper and David Pocock, an Australian duo worshiped as Buck Law.
Tiplick, who has played 67 international matches, has played several games and both players in the past, and knows exactly what awaits him.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you will be in a tough game.
They are always the best in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is an aggressive backsman, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when necessary.
I want to improve myself by fighting against the world's best players rather than playing against the background that is not so strong.
I want to fight with the best opponents, and if I play against them, I have to keep up with myself.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it's an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you can play a game that won't lose.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from a comedian?
A series of problems related to Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by dark sales of antisocial forces have also been closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto said at a press conference on July 22 that "the company has no talent at 9 and there is no talent at all," on average "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
If Yoshimoto had 90 percent of the "9:1" ratio, it would be considered that there were gifts from entertainers to Yoshimoto, and investors' views that taxes would be paid were also tweeted on Twitter.
If Galla's share is "9:1," is there a gift tax?
i heard from you.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the tax standpoint.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If it is "9:1" for the job of 1 million yen, the profit of 1 million yen in sales and 1 million yen in expenses will be 9 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns like this and already pay corporate taxes.
Also, even if you are wondering about allocation, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think that the amount received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that is firmly recognized by both sides, so if the performer does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying or selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original price for tax avoidance, it is a problem in calculating taxes.
However, as in this case, a third party will not be able to decide how much tax-appropriate prices are for those that both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think it's a poison to pay for one yen.

the white house, a panic without a foothold of impeachment.
The White House officials said Thursday that they were moving forward to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party, and detailed officials explained that this week there was a "great panic" feeling against the lack of plans to deal with the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be growing "a concern, anxieties and concerns" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some of the surrounding persons.
He said, "I don't really think it's true."
The White House official joked that there was no clear plan for this situation, or that the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter could not be applied, so there was no confidence in how to proceed, as this claim was so serious.
Another person who was familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the president's uncontrollable response would increase the likelihood of "injuring" if the impeachment was prolonged.
Another source of concern is that during impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is seen to be raised every day, and some close associates of the president are expected to further "impulsive" behavior.
Trump is increasingly concerned about unpredictable actions and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and is concerned about the president and politics in the electoral year.
Trump faced the greatest threat he had never seen before in his presidential term, and has changed his mind, becoming an attacker, becoming a defense counsel, and reviving his strategy that he considered effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Moller.
Trump attempted to lighten the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of whistleblowers as a motive for partisan conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the morale of the investigation, but this time they are beginning to feel the difference.
The president, whose power is considered a brand, seemed to be coming to the press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have answered questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that the damage can be reduced, claiming that it is a fact that undermines the credibility of the whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information about the controversial Trump and Vladimir Zellensky and the Ukrainian president.
Furthermore, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, Republican strategists close to the White House point out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and that the impeachment will not have much effect on new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news during the next four months, "there is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President."
Another source stated that those claiming impeachment could be the help of the president did not fully understand how uncertain the president's response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to an official who explained this plan, the initiative is still in its early stages, but it is not yet clear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader who can aggressively organize public relations activities in order to counter organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, as well as the publication and publication of critical internal accusations against the momentum of Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin stated that they would not publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later, stating that the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible.
It is expected that further pressure will be raised from the time of the investigation by Robert Meller, who spoke only through almost silent prosecutions.According to the person involved in the case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called Trump's external pitbull, Corey Luwandowski, who served as head of the former campaign headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the President and his policies for the past five years, but we've never met with the President or his close associates about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in impeachment by Clinton and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left Pat Cipolon, now White House's legal adviser, lacking such experience and currently lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
More detailed sources of information on the White House's strategy are generally aware that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but need to be organized and capable of leading all-out response and political struggle.

I had a boyfriend all the time, but due to his work, I had a long distance romance ....
I was told to marry someday, but I couldn't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation to marriage by side?
Editorial I of Nikkei Doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love studies" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice, which was derived from detailed data analysis, is required to read.
what's this?
I am worried whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during a long distance romance.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I work and my family home, but his place of work is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
The couple who got married from long distance love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (--) C is in a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend for one and a half years.
There is also the word "to be tested at a distance and the two become stronger."Is long distance love going well in the first place?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) Speaking of distance love, DeNA Travel's questionnaire survey (held in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous, but according to the data, only 16% of couples from distance love to marriage are known.
Since love is done with five senses, the relationship is deepened by seeing the partner (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touch), smelling (olfactory), kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to the other person's house, you will be burdened with time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even though it is a holiday to heal the tiredness of work, your body is a kata.
I feel refreshed when I return home.
Does that mean you have to break up when you're far away?
Morikawa If you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently, or a couple that has a certain period of time in advance, I think it will work.
You'll be engaged a year later, or you'll come back from your transfer two years later.
It may be difficult if you do not see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of demanding Trump's nude photo.
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems unbearable to the idea that President Donald Trump will be investigated.
Thursday, in a comment defending the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain a presidential nude photo.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive at the House of Representatives Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of a hearing about Trump's internal accusations of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the president's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, that there is a chance within a year.
After Congressman Nunes' rebuke was over, HuffPost's journalist Jennifer Bendilly decided to find out if the Democrats were looking for the truth.
Only Congressman Jim Heims of the Democratic Party of Connecticut has responded so far, but many other members are questionable whether the answer is red-naked truth.
Memediate.com speculates that Senator Nunes' nudist comments may be related to the "more unconfirmed details" that were allegedly written in the controversial steel document.
It is a notorious report in which former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to a "stick tape" in a hotel room in Moscow where Trump is said to be watching prostitutes urinate and suggesting existence.
Origami, wallet and real cards.
Remittance, Loan, Insurance, Investment - Yahoo! News
In addition to paying by Origami Pay, Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to move and withdraw money through remittances and collaboration with financial institutions accounts.
The function of charge is also added.
Together with partner companies, they will start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the challenges of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have an Origami ID, you will be able to seamlessly complete your application and transaction and get timely information.
He also explained that by deploying the Origami app not only on the Origami app but also on partner companies' apps, it will be a service available even if you don't have the Origami app.
Regarding loans, we introduce the functions that can be used to pay back in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were suddenly needed, it was completed on the Origami app from application to repayment.
As for insurance, he introduced Aioi Nissei Insurance and Dai-ichi Life as a partner company.
The two companies said they plan to use their data and knowledge to develop insurance products in line with life events.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand sequentially through registration of necessary administrative agencies.
New businesses for effective utilization of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business that will support the effective use of data, including data held by the company, in addition to digitizing customer contacts by its Pay through the payment function provided by Origami.
Origami recognizes that effective utilization of data, such as the acquisition of structured data such as sales and unstructured data in a real society, and the accumulation, processing, and analysis of such data, is becoming a challenge in partner companies that have partnered with Origami for payment and settlement functions.
Among them, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with payment data by its Pay and structured data held by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data as well as effective data utilization.
Mr. Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies gather various data to create customer contacts," and explained, "In the next phase, how to develop business models using data is key."
"We want to combine the data we built on the Origami Network and data from many companies to create innovation in the next phase."
Details of the service are announced sequentially.
In addition, at the Origami Conference 2019, Origami's future initiatives include providing convenience through mobile technologies such as delivering coupons to smartphones when it rains.
In addition, Origami Pay now provides full compensation for unauthorized use, which is clearly defined as a system under terms of use.
He also stated that he will work as a supporter in cooperation with tourism associations and other organizations to revitalize the region.

Regenerative biofuel research can reduce emissions
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks and Semis have monopolized the news, they are the only ones flying in the air that cannot reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta professor developed a technology to make renewable biofuels available as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Sciences, Alberta, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuel from lipid waste such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude fuel and waste from other industries can be used in the production process.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology achieved (actually generated) is hydrocarbons of molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is something like a dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low-risk approach that requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that are already partially developed to maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler commented on the second option, "You can try it in a reactor to change the chemical reaction a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and U.S. Army investing in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Forge currently operates a testing plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, and recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build 25 million US production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1,000,000 litres of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bressler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but there is no reduction in fuel transport and production.
"As a technologist," Bresler says.
My job is to create an option so that you can have multiple choices in parallel with the decisions made after the explanation.

Boris Johnson's camp warns that if Brexit is over, the UK will face riots like Los Angeles, the prime minister will call for calm.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and civil riots on the scale of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson said he needed to "quench anger" against the political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but insisted that he would not use the term "defeat."
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain calm, one minister told The Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gilles Joan or the Los Angeles riots of 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country simply because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow vest movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and there's a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot broke out in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to acquittal.
This year, French anti-government protesters wearing eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be catastrophic.
"If 30 million people vote in a referendum and 66% vote for those staying in the EU, 10 million people are dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed leaving, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congressmen.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum was to overturn the outcome of the first referendum, there would be a risk that "a violent riot by the people" would occur in this country.
Johnson wants to hold a general election and entrust Brexit to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a House of Representatives rebellion calling for lower demands on withdrawal from the EU and instead to hit the EU with a compromise.

A professional basketball player, Niigata Albirex BB, held a prayer for victory on the 27th, a week before the B-League began.
Niigata Albirex BB players and staff prayed for victory at Komachi Shinmeigu Shrine in Niigata City on the morning of the 27th.
Last season, Niigata won the club's first district championship.
At the end of the season, however, Davante Gardner was transferred to another team in the B league.
This season, with new foreign nationals, Nick Perkins, we aim to win more than last season's regional championship.

The opening match of Niigata will be played at Away on Saturday, October 5.
pakistan, brother of social media celebrity, life imprisonment for honor murder.
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is lengthy and takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memories of the case fade.
"It's too long for people to forget," said Farzana Bali, a female rights activist and founder of the first gender department at a university in Pakistan.
Human rights groups say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honorary murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the number of actual honor killings is much more than that, because it is estimated that Pakistan accounts for approximately one fifth of the 5,000 honor killings that are committed by honor-based violence surveillance organizations worldwide each year.
Anti-pork cholera measures 1.3 billion yen Add to the September supplementary plan in Shizuoka Prefecture (Asatsune Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A total of 148 million yen (about $136 million) was added to the supplementary budget plan for September 26 by the Diet Steering Committee.
It was proposed to the prefectural assembly on the 27th.
As a result, the total amount of general accounting for the supplementary budget for September was 8187 million yen.
In response to the outbreak of new pig cholera in Saitama Prefecture and elsewhere, the prefecture will add disinfection points for livestock carriers currently in Konishi City to three locations in Gotemba City, Fujinomiya City, and Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City near the Kanto region.
The total cost of the project was 7.74 million yen.
In addition, in order to prevent the spread of wild boars, which are the main infectious pathways, we will start measures to ensure that wild boars are not infected by pig cholera in areas other than western prefectures.
In the eastern part of the prefecture and central part of the prefecture, the cost of capturing and inspecting 1560 heads is 5.86 million yen.
In the decision-making process related to the elevated Numazu Station, the cost of commissioning the appraisal evaluation of the planned site and the operating costs associated with the holding of the sales committee are added.
According to the Secretariat of the Prefectural Appropriation Committee, the application for a decision by the prefecture and the city of Numazu to request the surrender of unpurchased land on the 18th was accepted on 19th.

The mayor's election is announced on the 29th.
Only Mr. Satoichi Kataoka (60) has announced his candidacy for the past four candidates.
In addition, he did not run for the first time in eight years, and the amount of money he had to vote was large.
Sosha City is promoting the city's reconstruction plan (FY2019 - FY23) to recover from the heavy rain disaster in western Japan, and it is questionable whether it will recover under severe financial conditions and steadily implement disaster prevention projects.

Floods and disruptions caused by prolonged monsoons in many parts of India
The monsoon season in India has been prolonged for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing buildings to collapse and death, and many crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their power in early September, but the average rainfall this month is 37% higher than usual.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues for a few days, the monsoon will weaken at the latest decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, the buildings collapsed due to heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays, killing several people.
The houses were flooded, and the inhabitants crossed the street with water on their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Raknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains have caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
Long-lasting monsoons are not desirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon at this time.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmhouse in Bimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables will rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also in danger.
The next big festival is in Dashera on 8 October, where the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, the evil smiling figure of the beard-boo appearing in the epic Ramayana.
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon pulls long, the last laugh may be Lavana.
[Sendai] Defeat Yokohama M with a compact defense Directed by Watanabe (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
J1 Begalta Sendai held a private practice for four days from 24 to 4 consecutive days (open to the press only 20 minutes at the beginning) for the 28th Battle of Yokohama M on the 28th.
Yokohama M lost 15 points in the last three games of the league, but manager Shin Watanabe (45) responded by saying, "The players showed me a powerful, battle-like exercise."
Last season, he lost eight games in the clubworths at home on July 18 and lost five in the enemy territory.
It is a difficult enemy to lose in 1-2 this season.
Yokohama M is currently ranked 14th in the league with 48 points in Thailand.
In addition to the 13-point FW Marcos Juniol (26), 10-point 7-assisted FW Nakakawa Teruto (27) and other strong frontline players, J's leading CB duo of Japan DF Hatakenaka Makinosuke (24) and Brazilian DF Chiago Multins (24) are also waiting.
Director Watanabe said, "There are plenty of aggressive play in and out, there are also speed CBs, we want to protect compact and fight with confidence without seeing the tear."
The Emperor's Cup for the first time was defeated by J2 Nagasaki on the 18th, and only eight league matches were played.
The commander said, "It was a regrettable loss, and it is now the most important to stand up from there."
It enhances the feeling and shows the results of the measures on the pitch.

Exposure to large amounts of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
Current studies have shown that working near high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this study is the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides at work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure at work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor in the Department of Elderly Care at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu Heart Program.
The study focuses only on Japanese Americans, and researchers say that it may not be applicable to women or other races.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear years after exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and heart attack at work is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably due to the increased importance of other factors related to aging and the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low- and medium-density pesticides was not important for heart disease and heart attack.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone meeting
The impeachment procedure for US President Donald Trump was taken, and it was a radical week in Washington's political affairs.
For political novice Vladimir Zerensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky-Trump telephone problem so far, and is there a widespread impact on Zelensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it is described in detail that Trump criticized Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on specific proposals.
Zerensky's response to Trump's 1000% argument is controversial.
Zelensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially opposition parties in Ukraine, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no precedent for support from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for support, including EU sanctions and economic aid, during the "Russian invasion."
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Voytica, said: "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then scrutinizes military aid and asks Zerensky to investigate two rather than one, one against Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the other on the server of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to complain about anyone.
"I'm grateful to the people who helped me with the announcement of the call," he said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the upcoming Normandy 4 Summit in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th ICAO General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The safety award was awarded to Ghana, who provisionally received 89.89% of the effective implementation rate and was awarded the highest score in Africa by Air Safety Director.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification survey (ICVM) on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the World Safety Director Audit Report of the United Nations Air Force.
The safety award is a result of the recognition that Ghana complies with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO for safety at airports and national airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's delayed National Zero Campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for safety evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was awarded to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director General of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aikoi Otou of Ghana to Canada, and director of Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Olmiwa Bennard Aliou stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in participating countries.
"It is important to always be aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada said that this award complements the indomitable efforts and perseverance of the sector and is a gift of Ghanaian efforts.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has great potential to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to dramatically change our lives."
There are social and economic benefits, but they are all safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump appoints Peter Gino as FEMA Chief: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Senate Committee in Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
FEMA's deputy director, Gino, was in the position of deputy director to oversee government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office has been in a state of absence since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Department of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, determined that Long had illegally used government-owned vehicles to commute between Washington and his home, Norcarorina, and resigned.
Another recommendation, Jeffrey Baird, raised doubts about drunkenness and involvement in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of the month after consideration.
Mr. Gino's appointment as director was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he had been on duty at the Emergency Management Department in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down San Gabriel Valley's illegal marijuana baying business.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police shut down illegal marijuana bating activities in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant on suspicion of selling illegal marijuana pens, care began at 4:37 p.m., and a large container of butanhanie oil was found in an office building on 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators also found equipment to pack the beep cartridge.
"This process is very dangerous," said Cano.
Capt. Cano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigations and that he could fire in the process of extracting oil used in the beep product.
"The static electricity from clothes alone can ignite, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," says Captain Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away not only by explosions one after another, but also by fire.
The group was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately disclosed.
The investigator said that he received an anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still searching for who is the black curtain of illegal baby activities.
The police said that because the office was empty, Zhang himself thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continued, the police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, to prevent illegal bating products from appearing again.
"I don't know if it's real or what I'm buying."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great deal of harm to our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a big earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6!
Evacuation training at Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
A practical evacuation drill was held at the hall in Miyazaki City, assuming that an earthquake occurred during the concert.
This training is held every year.
On stage, there is actually a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department, and it is assumed that an earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6 is occurring along the way of the song.
About 300 people including kindergarten children, local residents and hall staff participated in the training on the 27th.

The lost dress of Elizabeth I, exhibited at Hampton Court Palace
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver leaf threads, and the gorgeous embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Elery Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, is determined to be one point.
This faded piece of cloth, hung on the wall of a small church in one rural area, is said to have been placed there 100 years ago and is considered to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally discovered this gorgeous cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly the room that the Tudor Queen could have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one of the 16th-century dresses remains, indicating that it was an important discovery in the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no perfect evidence that Elizabeth passed her sleeves, three years of research has led to the conviction of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The "silver-threaded cloth" was provided by law only to senior members of the royal family, but the "master" quality plant and flower embroidery also suggests that the later additions of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears were noble men.
It is believed that the dress was the equivalent of a Tudor mansion at the time of its creation.
In addition, it is speculated in the late Elizabethan 1590s that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that she could not endure rivalries wearing such luxury clothing.
Lin said that it was important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
I was always very happy to see the cloth and say, "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of a piece of dress that was cut and used as an altarpiece of the unmarked Baxton St. Faith Church seems unexpected but not so.
Baxton is a village from Blanche Parry, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and a local legend says that the cloth has long been associated with Parry.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Parry died, but experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Parry before Elizabeth died in 1603.
Over 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and a very delicate hand-sewing altar cloth, will be displayed next to the rainbow portrait depicting Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The vast space as wide as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work was done and led by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you're really impressed by the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered on the front and back, you will find a great respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched"One week after missing girls, the Self-Defense Force withdraws Volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campsite in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces ended their search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for Kokura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village asked the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 days to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk, such as mountain slopes and saws.
Also, on the 27th, the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who volunteered to participate in the search were not known.
The police and fire departments are planning to continue searching from 6:30 am on the 29th.
1st Oral Speech - Yahoo! News
The first oral argument was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters were seeking to invalidate the election.
In response to the appeal, the plaintiffs sued the election invalid because the value of one vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to Fukui Prefecture, which had the lowest number of votes per member of the Diet in July this year.
In the first oral speech held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendant's side called for a rejection of the claim, saying, "It is not a matter of significant inequality, but should be constitutional."
The judgment will be passed on October 30.

Arriving at Space Station, Unmanned Resupply Vehicle Catching with Robot Arm | Shizuoka Shimbun
No. 8 Konotori, an unmanned supply vehicle that arrived at the International Space Station.
The robot arm of the station is growing from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on July 28.
On the night of the 28th, the unmanned replenishment machine Konotori 8 (JAXA) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), which is about 400 kilometers altitude, arrived near the station, and the astronauts during their stay operated the robotic arm and caught it.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, the speed difference is eliminated, approaching about 10 meters away.
The robot arm, which is 17 and 6 meters long, grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After being installed on the station, the flight attendants carry the luggage.
he was involved in one third of the mexican drug cartels
Chicago Out Immediately after sunrise on the West Side of Chicago, CBS News caught rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNite of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of overdose.
McNite said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named Nemecio Cervantes, commonly known as El Mencio.
Matthew Donahew DEA, executive officer in Mexico, said, "Mencho is the DEA and, indeed, the top-priority of the U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva Henellación (CJNG), is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel sold "a large amount of" cocaine, methane phetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck received a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California for 30 years, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From the six dead Mexican Army helicopters shot down to the involvement of the public executions this summer, El Mencho is not punished and defends his empire.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by drug cartels.
According to Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing.
At the production site, the bag of cocaine is stamped by the smuggler.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of toxic substances that effectively take away the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died of overdose last year.

Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the old days
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent state of play announcement, Sony announced the release date of its sequel, Last of As, February 2020.
Some of the video games of this new action game were showcased by fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Nortidog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
The last of the two parts, which had never been seen before since the PSwan era, was released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortiedog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"The story is magnificent and complicated in a different way than the previous one," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell stories with so many characters.
I didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but it eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but it was actually the beginning and realized that all the other sections started."
The game was very large and did not enter a single Blu-ray, making it two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are not open at work.
I don't want to ruin this surprise, but Easter Eggs in the game include nostalgic Notty Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will know more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the Last of As Remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently released a PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019, including the aforementioned Notty Dogs.
MLB The Show 19 will be released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like the Last of As Remastered and want to pre-order the sequel, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replicas, a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima Travel Sales "Save" Council Trial Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of the 26th day of Noto Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, the Noto Island Regional Development Council (Notoshima Regional Development Council) was established by residents.
In a trial until December, wagon cars loaded with daily necessities, seasonings and foods crossed the Suso-chokai and Hanpo-chokai on the first day.
There were also products that were sold more than expected and quickly replenished, and residents asked for continued "help" "It is fun to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including general vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even older people who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpira gobo were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
In the town of Suso, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't think it would sell so much."
Ms. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping for her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope that I will continue."
The user also ordered "I don't want canned coffee, but I want coffee to be dripped by myself."
The council will consider what was requested.
On Noto Island, there is currently only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to buy and sell goods to save "shopping weak."
Until December, the 20 town councils on the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to provide additional $100 million to drought-stricken residents.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been revised significantly to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-affected resident support organization, and the target farmers will receive up to $3,000 emergency assistance.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to 100 million dollars of drought relief money for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted over $7 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: The murder of a former wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of the five children.
Haskell said on July 9, 2014, that he was pushed into the house of Stay and asked where his wife Melanie Haskell was.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department announced that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13 and 4 years old sons, 9 and 7 years old daughters had died.
Only one of his family's only 15-year-old Cassidy Stay survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Casidi was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's claim of innocence.
The jury was dismissed until Monday.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of the girl who shook her anger resonated with the leaders of each country who were there.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and irritability protested all over the world, including Japan.
It is estimated that about 4 million people attended in more than 150 countries.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will be launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than twice, if possible, to 1/5.
All participating countries shall take measures that are specified by each country without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is pointed out to be related to global warming.
In order to achieve global warming at a fast pace, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit achieved by the call of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to intensify the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal of virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated their new targets, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers has become noticeable.
It is also strongly criticized by Japan for its strong coal-fired power generation.
The government's long-term strategy lists zero emissions as early as possible in the second half of this century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years" is large.
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who demonstrated Japan's efforts at environmental-related meetings, said at a conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool and sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The injury, which is not controversial, is nothing more than the "replacement of issues" that the person himself refutes.
There is no longer a grace to deal with global warming, and the international community has to deal with the common crisis.
We can't expect the effectiveness of each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act not to take away the future.
Science Daily
The U.S. Army's research has led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such an Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and timekeeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute Distributed Quantum Information Center, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute and operated by the U.S. Army Combat Capability Development Department, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and measured in one, even if one quantum bit is physically far from the other, the measurement results in the other are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, which published results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distances.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum internet.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglements at exits through the fiber also maintain sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and at the same time excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nm, which is immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Dr. Lañon.
The team then sent the light particles first through a non-linear crystal with a strong laser.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nm, the optimal value of long-distance transport - the standard wavelength of current long distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
In the measurement results, atoms and photoparticles remained entangled despite their long distance travel after converting wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured simultaneously with high-quality "clock" quantum bits, which leads to the realization of entangled networks in long-range atomic clocks.
The large entangled clock network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate positioning, navigation and time-keeping applications," said Dr. Frederick Fatemi, another Army researcher who co-operated the program.
