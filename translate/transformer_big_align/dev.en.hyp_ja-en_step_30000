Pope, AI development is based on public profits and warnings by IT companies
Pope Francis warns the IT companies, diplomats, investors, and investors if they are not accompanied by the ethical evaluation of public interests, the AI development competition and other digital development would increase social fairness.
The Pope stated that the government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists, and ethics were held at the Vatican Conference.
The conference was invited by a few scholars and Catholic bishops.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence that the Vatican had the opportunity to participate in the future of sexual and dangerous discussions in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions on the futureness of war development and increasing machine work were conducted at the same time, and at the same time, some cases were verified about the response of social media companies in the New Zealand Civil War.
In his speech at the conference, Pope commended the development of technical progress, stating that the machine was liberated from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the revolution.
However, if it is too much to rely on robot engineering to pursue profit, there is a fear that the dignity of labor is taken from human beings.
"If technological advances are becoming increasingly prominent, it is not true progress."
If the so-called technology progress is against public interests, unfortunately, we will be able to reverse the condition that is based on the theory of strong people.
According to the conference organizer, I would like to find people who will be able to know the future advisors of the Catholic Church on high-tech fields.

Turn the accelerator pedal to eliminate the accident!
4th selection of emergency prevention devices - Yahoo! News
it's obvious that you can buy it at reasonable prices.
A traffic accident occurs by driving errors.
In particular, the accident caused by a brake and accelerator step by older drivers is increasing.
In particular, when you move forward, it becomes a panic state, and it is sometimes possible that the accelerator is taking on the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with a safety drive support function that is not covered by such driving errors, but there is also a device that can be installed on unsuitable vehicles.
These later parts manufacturers develop and sell fast prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what kind of features they have.
At the same time the accelerator and the brake pedal interval is narrower.
[e-ACELALRM] The idea of informing a pedal from a new perspective is "e-ACELAL ARM developed by Pibots."
The pedaling mistake is to avoid the warning sound.
The mechanism occurs when the brake is stopped or slow driving, and the accelerator pedal needs more than necessary.
In response to the sound, we encourage the accelerator to return quickly and recognize the pulses quickly.
It is also effective for the elderly drivers who are unable to understand the changes in engine sound due to the pulse.
The OBDII connector is attached to the OBDII connector and the body is attached to both tapes.
The price is 9800 yen (tax included), and the price is also attractive.
The World Wing launched its launch in mid-September, but it is said to be safe to see the accelerator brake failure.
It is also possible to reverse (back) without advance.
At the time of the stop (and less than 10Km/h) the accelerator pedals are rapidly moving forward and down, the vehicle's vehicle's speed signal and brake signals are detected, and the accelerator's opening power prevents rapid progress.
When it comes to the accelerator pedal, the signal from the accelerator will not be transmitted and immediately control the rapid progress in the cleaning state (in which the brake is removed in the D range).
There is also a function that detects the speed of more than 5Km/h in the retreat (back) and reduces the vehicle to the cleaner state.
The mounting is only possible for the calibration and simple wiring processing.
The property price is 37,000 yen (tax tax).

The relationship between the Bols Johnson and the women's businessman Jenniferri to the police director
The police director (IOPC) examines whether the President of London should examine the Prime Minister Johnson as a violation of the penal code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that the GLA's director had recorded the "Community" of the Prime Minister's policy on the action of the Prime Minister.
GLA says that there is a information that shows the possibility of a crime.
This is never proven.
IOPC is considering whether it is necessary to investigate this issue.
The problem was given to IOPC, but IOPC is an institution that responds to charges issued by the police in England and Wales.
The problem was taken by the police director, and Johnson was at that time, as he had a position equivalent to the police officer.
Johnson rejects the fraud associated with the relationship with Arcade.
Prior to this point, Johnson stated that "the difference is the difference," but he would follow the instructions of the London Parliament to seek detailed information about the relationship with Arcade.
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but by the press, Johnson paid 126,000 pounds from the public in London during the time of the mayor of London, and was encouraged to participate in three times as well as by Johnson.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of 10,000 pounds to the company, the hackershouse.
The company will ask questions about the investigation process before the subsidies are paid.
He was a member of the House of Representatives of the Digital Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said that the company owned a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California Office, which is believed to be the current location.
The relationship between Prime Minister and Women's businessman was "the secret between the staff."
The movement of GLA to try to deposit the Prime Minister's office was touched by the anger of the Prime Minister.
The government officials said that this was an attack based on political motives, and the timing of the party's previous night was "very party party."
"There was no evidence for any charges, and the Prime Minister did not receive the opportunity to respond to the director's office before the announcement of the press on Friday night.
The public and the media will also be able to see political Kyogen that was organized by the people.
As I mentioned earlier, the standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessman who supported the tourism and regional promotion department in London was "public secret."
The former staff members of London and Partners (L&P) expressed their privilege to accompany the foreign trade-related meetings under Johnson's mayor during the time.
It is a safe and secure fund that can be used to form a property!
Today's 20th anniversary of the capital fund - Yahoo! News
I heard the future outlook for the future.

Do you look back for this 20 years and feel the current feeling?
First, in the history of 20 years, there were many people's thoughts and efforts.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude for all the people involved in the relationship, rather than the history that I played with only the money fund.
Originally, it was said that "I was able to support the formation of the property of the general living people."
The spirit of this spirit has remained unchanged, and has been pursued for over 20 years.
When the generals are removed from the anxiety of money, the world will become bright as the foundation, and we are encouraged to work on a daily basis.
In the long term, operation does not work together with beneficiaries and steps.
At the time of the decline in the yen such as Lehman shock and IT bubble, there are many money.
"It's time like this, so I feel that we have been able to support companies that are needed in the world."
As a result, it is the reason why it became a longevity fund for 20 years, and I believe that it was a direct sales system to deliver messages directly to many people.
We have disclosed all investment companies, money and costs at the end of each month.
In general, the information that you're buying now is black box, but "I'm sure all the money funds are disclosed.
What is the reason why this initiative can trust you?

However, all the silver color is silver.
Gold was not completely visible.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!

Although the size of the ring is small, the one side of the left side of the bag is lined up with the bag, the same creation ...!
At this point, the road to the bag repair was opened.
It is attached.
what?!
The ring opening is broken into the inside and is strong to pull the outside.
I was attached to a bag.

So I tried to make a ring together.
Because of the lightweight parts, the weight is no problem.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts of Kirara has increased, and I feel that the design has been improved.

As a result, only three weeks after the EU summit, the Prime Minister's concern has been growing around the prime minister.
Bolz Johnson is facing the rebellion of the cabinet seeking to reduce the demands of the EU and to connect the EU and compromises.
The negotiations on a new tariff system that replaces the back stop clauses related to the Irish border, and the EU considered the replacement of Johnson's alternatives as "to run impossible."
The senior ministers of the United States, led by the Prime Minister of Germany, would like to propose a compromise on the three-year period of time remitto, which led by the Prime Minister of Germany.
The San paper heard that after the election of the Conservatives held in Manchester next week, the Ministers' Meeting was held.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the "experience" strategy, which would not be threatened by the withdrawal of the EU that was invented by the senior advisor Domin Minikkamings, and to accept the provision of the EU to limit time.
One Ministers said that the Supreme Court would be illegal in the closing of the Congress on Tuesday, and even "in the current situation, compromises were the only way we could withdraw from October 31."
We won't win the number of people in the House, and they oppose us.
The Prime Minister has to use it more than a step.
Even in the extremes, the plan of Castings was clearly unsuccessful.
It is not possible to fight in many areas.
Another minister, however, promised to talk to Johnson to run the agreement for Prime Minister Terry Mayo.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I would like to talk to Terryza to return to the House."
For this reason, everyone is trying to end this.
If you don't delay, Boliss ends, and we all end.
John Mayer claimed that he was not serious about negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party said, "The Prime Minister wants to connect with the EU to the agreement.
However, we do not look at the fact that the Prime Minister has established an agreement with the EU.
Instead, the Prime Minister, in Scotland, examines the eggs and discuss with the people in the Ulez as well as debates on the nationals.
The Prime Minister said yesterday that the agreement is still far ahead of the agreement, and if no one does not think, the way is still long."
However, the press officials also stated that the Ben bill, which forced to re-election for three months, said that in Brussels, "the position of our negotiations is very weak."
"There is no doubt that this bill prevents us from the position of negotiations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are trying to work hard despite the establishment of the bill."
Stephen Barclay, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the European Union, returned to Brussels for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two discussed how the regulation area of all Irish islands on food and livestock is functioning.

he was afraid of a trap in Zimbabwe
According to the government officials, Prime Minister Constantino Chiwenga resigned from the fact that President Robert Mugabe's request from President Robert Mugabe would be a trap that could lead to the action of the Army in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the Defense Forces continued to be held, and Mugabe offered the presidency to Chiwenga, and the last week in Zimbabwe's Indiana Pendent paper was reported.
However, due to the fact that Chiwenga refused to offer, it is due to the fact that he saw the intention of the Mugabe to use Chiwenga to use the leaders of the world and the African Union for the use of Chiwenga, rather than anxiety.
According to a series of Twitter reports that the authorities confirmed that the government was a senior of the Cabinet Office's Cabinet Office's Cabinet Office, Mugabe, who had been holding the government for 37 years, was said to have been a strong deal of negotiations at that time.
Mugabe, who knew that he had lost power, said that the government authorities had tried to contact Chiwenga by the messenger.
According to the government officials, the arbitration between the Army Command and the former President was held by three.
He and his senior officials were involved in negotiations with George Charanba, the head of the Central Information Agency at the time, and the Roman Catholic bishop, Fideris Mukono, who were involved in negotiations.
Gudeon Gono, former Governor of Zimbabwe, is a member of the role of the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe's Republic of China's Republic of Defense.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, attempted to blame the forces of the African Union while seeking intervention by leaders of Africa.
The service to the former CDF (the commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of President before the death.
"It was an effort to save the rapidly growing situation in some parts of the former president's family," he wrote.
However, at least, the political goal of the late President was slightly different.
If you want to destroy the Constitution, you would have to clash with the views of the African Union on the coup, but you would like to remember that the commander did not defeat the Constitution and would not break it.
President Mugabe, who was the top of the army at that time, hoped that Chiwega would be a trap, and the commander of the commander who claimed that he had not defeated the Constitution.
President Mugabe, President of the Republic of Africa, who did not decide whether the situation should be considered as a coup without knowing the entire situation, would eventually be considered to be a valid case.
That was the intention and calculation of this offer.
When I realized that by the defense forces, Mugabe was moving, and the authorities speak.
He was alerted to be executed like Kadafi in the army, and Mugabe was unable to write a post-chief.
The commanders of the army were sent to Mugabe, although they were not able to invade the president's home called Blue Luff.
At that time, Mugabe wanted to protect his family and prove the power of the army.
The commanders and commanders at that time read exactly their intention.
In the words of the messengers who told the President's desperate speech, "We belong to the Istire Bikepa Macwapa (which is part of the army), we were used as a strong metaphoric expression, which is not only during political competition without politicians."
The Army said that through the military commanders in the region, the purpose was to remove the "criminal" around him, rather than to defeat Mugabe.
In order to discuss the coup and successors, Mugabe attempted to return to South Africa using the same method as the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe was required to support the region.
The key South Africans who refused to intervene in this process, but the South African forces would soon be sent to Harare when the South African forces were invaded by the President.
"It wasn't supported by the President Putin and the African leaders, so it was not possible to achieve it."
The treaty ratified by the United Nations was ratified in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[New York] On the 26th of the UN headquarters in New York, the meeting was held for the world without nuclear weapons, and Mr. Takeuchi, who was the grandson of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital) at the time of the bombing of the atomic bomb, spoke with the support of the Nuclear Weapons Convention.
The treaty was ratified by the new five countries and ratified by the Treaty of Nuclear Weapons in 32 countries.
The treaty should be ratified by 50 countries and regions.

China needs a strong leadership force, but if you don't have a "fall" policy document
China has required the Communist Party to have a powerful and unified guidance, and the country would be "resolved" before the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government announced on Friday.
The Chinese Ministry of Affairs of the Republic of China said that the Communist Party had established the government over 70 years ago, and the success of the previous year was due to the leadership of the party.
China is wide, and the situation in Japan is complex, but there are few political problems.
Without a strong leadership force, China is said to be a great disaster for the world to move to split and collapse.
As the Chinese authorities have been required for the stability of the nation, it has been justified for a long time to deal with problems in a robust way, like the abolition of democracy in Beijing in 1989.
On Tuesday, the second largest economic power ceremony in the world was held on Tuesday, and the president of the U.S. government in the second half of 2012.
He also directed the modernization program of the army that threatened the region.
China does not intend to export its own development models and not to incorporate other models, but also to seek peace as well as policy documents.
Among the Chinese national genes, there are no other national invasions and world control.
In modern times, China has been bullished from the column, and the war and chaos left deep scars with pain; China will never be able to bear the pain they experienced.
China's strong trade war with the United States faces a great deal of problems such as the slowdown in the economy and the anti-government movement in Hong Kong.
It is said that China will never abandon nuclear profit and will not be able to harm security and sovereignty.
"There is no tariff that continues to rise with the threat of trade war," says White Paper in relation to the trade conflict between Washington and Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with a full industrial chain, a wide market space and a strong economic development momentum.
"It is never possible to weaken the trade war," he said.
It is convinced that China has a power to open a new world by changing the crisis to a chance.
In China, there is no idea to counter the U.S. and I don't want to replace the U.S., so the U.S. should be calmly aware of the development of China.
U.S. can't control China and stop the development of China.
If the U.S. would not maintain its strength if it would prevent other countries, suppressing, suppressing, and move abroad.

Judge's Court of Justice: How about Hokkaido newspapers?
In a lawsuit against marriage, the "no marriage" was held during the same period.
There are more than 20 countries that acknowledge the marriage, and there is no legal effect in the country, and the municipal government, such as Sapporo, has become a system to authenticate the partnership.
Based on the judgment, two women were admitted to the fact of marriage.
It is considered to be the first judicial judgment that approved legal protection for couples.
It is not possible to accept the same marriage due to the provisions of civil law and family register law, but a lawsuit for damages in the country is conducted in five jurisdictions such as Sapporo.
In the mouth of the judgment, I would like to deepen understanding of the rights of sexual minorities and discuss the ways of the law system to recognize various families.
She lived in the United States for about seven years and received a marriage certificate in the U.S., but the plaintiffs sought compensation for the former partner.
The judgment was recognized as "the reality of marriage between men and women" due to the achievements of two people.
It is a revolutionary decision to expand the marriage certification with the right to marry in social insurance.
In addition, it is important to note that the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of marriage is only based on marriage agreement only.
It is said that "It is not possible for the purpose of denying the marriage of the same marriage at the time of the establishment."
It is expected that the Constitution would not be considered to be the same marriage, but it is expected that the government will not be able to hear whether it is prohibited or not.
On the other hand, however, since the marriage was not accepted, "the difference between men and women" was different from legal protection.
If you accept the same status as men and women, you might not be able to separate the right to protect.
In the study of national home trends for married women, more than 70% of the people who had to admit that marriage should be legalized.
As a result of the diversification of lifestyle, the law is tied to traditional family statues, making it possible to take the right of people who are not able to afford it.
Due to the fact that marriage is not accepted by the law, there are still few restrictions on whether it is not a spouse, but there is no need for a joint parent.
In addition to marriage between marriages, it is necessary to review family legislation from various perspectives, including the expansion of legal rights of marriages.

[New sports]
it's obviously a serious pollution of popular tourist attractions, videos
In Sydney, Sydney, Australia's tourism resources that will bring $2 million to Australia's economy, Sydney Harbour is the largest producer of operahouses, surfer key, Luna Park, and famous Herbert Bridge.
However, under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
The famous port of Sydney is one of the worst waterways in Australia that flows around 15 cups of swimming pool every year.
Thanks to this statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to the new video from Sydney Harbor, Australia's most popular cities around the area of the city, there are plenty of food, clothing, clothing, and animal dead bodies - all flows into Sydney Harbor by rain flowing through the road.
In particular, the biggest factor in removing waterways is plastic.
A video released on September 27th of the world's tourism program, Dr. Claudius, Vice President of Sydney Harbor Research Program, said "This is a paradex."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of Japan's coastlines very modified and contaminated mouths.
According to CSIRO, about 1560 kilograms of plastics flow into the waterways, most of them are flowing into Sydney Harbor via the rainwater drainage route.
"There was a lot of heavy rains, but after that, Sydney Harbor was quite a tragedy."
Two-thirds of pollution flows from rain water flowing through the road.
However, it is like a part of the ice mountain, and the bottom of the water of the Sydney Harbor, 70 percent of plastics flowing into the ocean are stored in the sea.
"I don't really know what's going on under the sea level, but I don't know what's wrong," says Dib Center Manley, owner Richard Nicole, the owner.
If you know more (how many people are under the water), I think everyone is really happy.
It's overwhelming, but we're more than half of the whole things we discover.
The remaining half is used for plastics somewhere.
Sydney Harbor looks beautiful, and soon down the water, everyone can't believe that all plastics and garbage flows.
One of the founders of Ocean Protech, Jeremmy Brown, said that it could be possible for local residents to reduce plastics and garbage in the waterways.
we should start from the source of occurrence.
By reducing the use of plastics, recycling more well, and eventually flows into the sea, we must be more conscious about what flows in the water mouth.
The 50 percent of oxygen that we sucked will come from the ocean to kill ourselves.
Oceans absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
But we repair Sydney Harbor and return to the old appearance, but very simple.
killing the sea is killing humans.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also announced in this month, as part of the activities to provide a wide range of knowledge about the environmental protection and reduction of the effects of beverage containers in the natural environment.
According to a new survey, about 546 children aged 12 and 18 years old, 82 percent of them have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is an adult.
The study also expressed concern about the problem of plastic waste in the fourth place of concern for parents, and the parent of 551,93 percent of the survey said that the amount of plastic waste that flows into the ocean was increasing.
Most of the research participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but how did you change it?

It is open to a breakthrough that researchers may face the key to cancer treatment.
The medical researchers tried to find out how some cancer cells were.
Researchers found that the same process occurs in the Samanmandville and humans.
In this discovery, a new method of treatment for cancer patients is expected.
What is the common common common relationship between the people and humans?
It is a cancer cell that cannot be seen.
The team, including researchers at Peter Mac column Cancer Center in Melbourne, found a great discovery that could significantly change the treatment of cancer.
It is possible that there is a possibility that the key to working on a severe face tumor that threatens the future of the Samanmandeville.
In this study, some cancer cells in humans and bags were reacted by markers to use a series of proteins called PRC2, and the immune system failed to attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called a small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, Merkel cells.
Dr. Mark Doson, a researcher of Peter Mac column, said, "This project is very important for patients who show resistance to immune therapy," said AAP.
It may be possible that the immune system will be able to identify the cancer cells again as a marker, which is known as MHC.
Dr. Doson said, "There may be considerable impact on patients with lung cancer."
"The lung cancer is an infectious disease in the world.
And it may be possible to treat in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery eventually to be used for treatment of the face-of-the-face tumors that are happening in the case of cancer cells escape detection.
"It's surprising that the same process will occur at the Guns of Human and Tusmandville."
"I've never been able to treat the tumor in the Tusmandeville.
However, if the drugs that are effective for humans may be useful for the control of tumors.
it's a huge planet that orbits the star.
Scientists discover the solar system that covers the current understanding of the formation of the planet, which is known as a red dwarf, orbits around a small star called a red dwarf.
On September 26, 2019, a large gas planet GJ3512b was released around the red dwarf star.
The stars are usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, there is no difference in the size of stars and planets, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star known as GJ3512 is the size of about 12% of the Sun, but the planets that orbit around them are at least half mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"That's why it's another surprise."The research led by the research led by the University of Catalonia, a physicist at the Institute of Space Sciences, Juan Carlos Molaez.
The theoretical formation model shows that usually low mass stars are the main stars of a small planet similar to Earth and small sea kings.
In this case, a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter was discovered around a very small star."
The planet, which is composed of gas mainly like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope of the Spanish Color Alto Observatory.
The planet takes about 204 days while drawing an elliptical orbit around the star.
Red dwarfs are small and low surface temperature.
GJ3512 is not only smaller than our Sun, but also the same size as the giant planet, which is about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the radiation energy is smaller than the sun, the surface temperature is much lower than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 degrees.
That's why I have a red color."
On the other hand, while the second planet is now orbiting the stars, the third planet may be released from its star system in the past, and the description of the elliptical orbit of Jupiter-type planets was explained.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of stars and dust that generate their orbit.
In the most powerful planet formation model called core integration model, the object is generated from solid particles in the disk, resulting in the atmosphere of the surrounding gas generated by the force of producing the eggs of the planet.
It may be possible to explain this unusual planet system by using a conflict model called self gravity instability model.
"If this is the case, the primitive planetary disk surrounding stars may be slightly larger than the thought, and the temperature was low."
Because the disk becomes unstable, some density areas may appear.
These traps grow until the collapses and form planets.
i'm going to eat a cockyp with an expiratory employee, adamant.

Trump's hotel owner's complaints, and there's a license to sell sake.
Washington (AP communication) - Washington's alcohol beverage officer in Washington, resigned from the appeal of Washington to review the permission of local Trump International Hotel.
The committee was held on Wednesday, because most of the petitionees had no fixed assets in Washington, Washington, or the same state had no fixed assets.
According to Washington Post, it is the second time that, according to the law of the state that the applicant is required to obtain the license of alcohol, it is necessary to cancel the rights of the hotel.

The appeal was rejected because the permission was already accepted.
In addition to the renewal of the permission certificate, the second appeal was issued.
It is the first harvest of honey, which is collected by Benteller's "Fold Beses" to feed.
How about the taste of the honeys collected by the flyB's knees.
In May 2019, it was held on the board site of Benteller's crew in England, and the first harvest of honey was harvested in September.
In addition to the lack of loss to the staff working at the crew factory, they gathered more than 100 bottles from a single nest box.
In the factory site where the car is assembled, why did Bentling have been making a feeder?
I want to see it!
It is here, here are 11 pieces of honey.
Peter Bosh, director of the company's manufacturing department, commented below.
"The aim of contributing to the conservation of biodiversity in the region was to establish a nest box for the first time on the vast grounds of the crew factory.
From the mountains planted on the grounds and around Nonoyama, honey bees have been attracted to various flowers.
I found that this place is suitable for breeding, and it is wonderful that there are so much harvests in the first year.
Bentling is a part of the production of crew factories and our company's business as much as possible as possible as the top of the high-end automobile manufacturers.
The staff actively cooperates.
It is very happy that the first harvest was completed, and next year we established more nest boxes and plans to increase the amount of harvests of Bentellers.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to work on various initiatives in order to play our own role, and we will continue to work on various initiatives in May 2019.
In September of the same year, in September of the same year, the work of taking the nest from the nest box was completed and the nest was cut off, and then the bottle was packed.
You can also see the bottle and package of honey and honey.
The design of the label was directed by designer Louise Mac column, who is responsible for the interior of Benteller.
The bottled beads are not only covered by staff but also gifts to customers and customers who visit the crew factories.

After the war, the police sent the police to the United Kingdom the worst.
The Cleveland Police reported that it was inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continued to "a serious deterioration," and Phil Gomley said.
In six years, the police officers were replaced by five police officers, and now they are facing a voice asking for new destruction.
According to the report, he tried to prevent crime and arrest the suspect and to protect the vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley, the police director, said, "We're going to be very serious when we finally investigated."
The head of the police station, Mike Vil, resigned from the office for less than a year, but on his own actions, however, had been examined by several non-published charges.
The deputy director Adrian Robartz was arrested after being arrested on charges of illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, who had been involved in sexual activity last year, led to an illegal investigation committee for his colleagues.

Nancy Pelosi: William Bar has to be a criminal, and there is no need to be a dispute with the punishment.
I don't know who will happen now.
At present, we believe that we have been involved in the incident, and we may take some time to study."
"We're going to work based on the time to discover facts and facts."
With the record of the White House published in this week, Trump found that the President of the Ukraine asked the President of Warrodi Mill Zerensky to ask Vice President Joe Biden and his son.
According to the call record, Trump also found that he was asked for Zerensky to cooperate with the Bar clan and his personal advisor Ledi Julia.
Trump refuses to deny it.
CNN first noticed the internal charges against Trump's actions in Ukraine, before more than a week of formal inquiry, and reported on Thursday and Thursday.
The Ministry of Justice, who was charged with a complaint from the information agency, decided that Trump's call conference would not be involved in the investigation of political financing.
In response to the question that the bar should testify, Pelosi said that the intelligence special committee would determine who witnesses the witness.
However, Peroci added that Bar said he would become a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was quite before.
"It was the name of the bar at the end of the year," Mr. Peroi expressed his view that Trump had given the name of the bar justice.
It's interesting that the bar will be facing the judgment on the disposal of this accusation.
On the other hand, Mr. Peroci said, "I'm very concerned about the internal accusations that became the source of information, Trump attacked the charges as a spy on Thursday, and that in the past, he had been treated differently for spy."

The review committee should be configured with a fair neutral member from the outside without any interest.
For example, Davis signed a contract with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Mr. Osse Kuwak Perma about 10% reward.
He is also known as the Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, he had a interest in him, so he did not allow the commission to be allowed.
According to the Committee of the Olympic Board, Fred Papoee attended the Committee of the Olympic Committee, he suggested that if he attended the Committee on the side of the chairman's relationship with the club, he suggested that he would have prejudice and unfairness.

According to the survey of the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54.2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture believed that it would be "good for the minimum wage thousand yen."
In FY2018, 90% of companies were hired, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of plans was around 50% of new graduates and senior employees.
Many companies responded to the increase in the yen (100 percent) and the construction industry (70,6 percent).
The majority of the percentages that were opposed were the manufacturing industry (51,9 percent) and the service industry (60,9 percent) including food and dining, and accommodation.
The members of the conference said, "There is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in parts and time-consuming industries, but it is difficult to secure human resources, and there are many companies that think that labor costs increase.
The average amount of money was 895 yen (about 829 yen from October 4 to 829 yen).
When I heard the situation where I joined the company in March 19, the new graduates were employed at 61,3 percent, and the mid-term adoption was 54,5 percent, and non-regular adoption was conducted by 154%.
It was 8.6% of the program.

before the Battle of Tiprick, the enemy
"Now I'm going to show that Wales will meet the World Cup King Tianshan, Australia's victory, Jassin Tiprick said.
When Wales wins the Wala beads, they will be the most hot victory candidate in the pool D, perhaps the semifinals against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia won the 14th victory against Wales, Tiprick and the team were one of the best eight races in England.
"It's natural, I want to end up with both teams and win at the top of the group."
There was a severe result in the fight against Australia, but in the autumn of last year it was good.
Australia seems to be very upset to return the loan, but it's until it's hard to win again.
Before I came here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I came here now, and now it is a real show.
In the past World Cup, Wales won only one win in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and won the victory for Wala beads 32 years ago.
And under the supervision of Warren Gattland, the total score for the Southern Hemisphere's weight class three teams was 41.
Wales stopped the last November test match in Australia, but Tiprick included a number of representative members who won the match 9-6 and one of the players playing at Tokyo Stadium on this Sunday.
Before that victory, I heard that Tiprick said: "It is difficult to answer."
Surely, it was a game, and maybe I thought that everyone would not win.
As a result, I was able to score more than 15 points in the final game, so I thought it was more than usual.
In order to win Wales, a combination of Australia, who is worshiped as Back Lo, Michael Fuper and David Pokeke, and a breakdown battle with Tiprick.
In the past, Tiprick, who has experience in the 7th international tournament, has fought against any player in the past and knows what is waiting for.
"They're definitely the world levelbacks players."
When you fight against the back edge of the world glass, I always know that I'm going to play a tough match.
The two remain the world's highest level.
So I don't know what kind of game is.
Pokeck is one of the best players in the world, but if Michael is one of the best players in the world, it is possible to know that rugby is more likely to be right in the way needed.
I would like to increase myself with the world's best players.
If you want to fight with the best opponent, then you'll have to be able to make yourself feel better.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important game for us.
The momentum is important.
If you continue to perform a good performance, then you can play a game without losing the momentum.

East Enerders, Planetor: After the bomb news, Ben kisses the column.
In East Eders, a sudden bomb news of Hotney Dean (showna Macgerty) was surprised, and the column returned to the original of love, and the hot tension of the column and Ben Mitchell ( Max Bowling) was also near the explosion.
But why do you regret this hot moment?
The column helped Ben, and since the help of Boby Beer ( Clay Miller Russell), two people have continued to slowly, but the column has recently been happy to see Ben's weakness and gentle appearance.
tonight, Hutney, but better feel better than before you go, return from vacation.
Immediately after the death of Walford, who was supposed to be a sad wedding and a wife of a flower, it was obvious that she had a very effect.
When Hotney came home, he had to talk about the column and the stomach.
However, shortly thereafter, Hotney added a bow to the column where he knows new facts.
The column turns out, and Jammy Borswick is worried about seeing a column to drink at Queen Vick.

However, the column with a new confidence towards the father of the gay father decided to fight to get the right things they want.

If Yoshimoto's business takes about 90 percent of Gala's work, it's true that he will receive a gift from the performers.
In a series of issues in Yoshimoto's business, which led to the development of anti-social forces, the problems surrounding Gara are closed.
Mr. Taro Okamoto, President of the conference on July 22, said, "It's not true that the company's talent is 9 and that's not exactly what it's like."
If the percentage of "9:91" is given by Yoshimoto, the view of investors who had been paid to Yoshimoto was considered to be a gift to Yoshimoto, and the view of investors who had taxed is flowed over 30,000 times.
If Garra's withdrawal was "9:91," it would be possible to pay the tax.
He heard that he was a taxman.
In the first place, the company is not the subject of donations.
In any case, we will answer you from the tax position.
Since Yoshimoto's business is not an individual, it is not the subject of the gift tax.
In the case of "9:1" of work, Yoshimoto's business will increase the profit of ¥90 million and the amount of ¥90 million.
This is the subject of corporate tax.
Of course, you should have a tax statement and already pay the corporate tax.
In addition, even if you think about the allocation, it is not that the amount of money you have actually received is different from the amount you should get.
And I think that the amount I received is issued as sales.
The gift shall not be given as an individual if the person is not aware of it.
Obviously, there is a price (e.g., real estate trading) which is a problem with the calculation of taxes if trading at the original price for tax avoidance.
However, as this time, there is no need for third parties to decide whether the appropriate price of tax is at any time.
Personally, I think that the payment book for 1 yen is a poison.

Members of the White House reported that on Thursday, the new Democratic Party's objections were made to counter the pressure against the new Democratic Party, and the relevant parties discussed the fact that there were no plans to cope with new reality.
The person near the White House said that about the atmosphere of the West Building, the opinion of the internal defendants seemed to have been increasing due to the possibility that the President and some surrounding people would have greatly damaged.
He said, "I don't know what's wrong."
The White House officials said that there was no clear plan for this situation, and the possibility that the President could not apply the usual measures for the president's decision to work well, so this claim was very serious, so I didn't know how to proceed, and that's not what the next news was reported."
Another person who is familiar with this dispute was expressed as "the state where the atmosphere in the White House has been increased by alarming" due to the fact that the President would respond to a long-distance hearing.
Another problem is that the pressure of the President is expected to be raised every day, and there is also a close relationship between President and President, who is expected to act as "respondence."
Trump's actions are more likely to be predicted, and concerns about the possibility of a violent attack outside the expected way, and is concerned about President and politics in the environment of elections.
Trump faced the greatest threat to the president's term, and had changed his hand to the attack side, such as restoring strategies that were deemed effective during the Russian investigation.
Trump tried to look at the request for the President of Ukraine who wanted to cooperate with the government's investigation and tried to withdraw the trust of internal prosecutors as well as the motivation for the candidate of the Democratic Party and Joe Biden.
However, many of the White House officials had to endure the trial of Moler's investigation, but this time they began to feel different.
He is said to be the president of the brand, but he seemed to be invited by the press conference on Wednesday, so he said that he was familiar with this situation.
Trump enjoyed a question about Russia's alleged investigation, but it seems that he didn't answer questions about Ukraine.
There is a person who knows the fact that the internal charges are not directly informed by President Trump and the President of the Ukraine, who have no direct information on the call, claim that he is convinced that he can reduce damage.
In addition, when the president is attacked, it is likely that the momentum of the support layer to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategy near the White House pointed out that the government's basic support rate is already very high, and the effect of acquiring new supporters is not too much.
In particular, if the punishment is interrupted by the legislation, the news will be limited to 4-6 o'clock, and there is no advantage to focus on the appeal of the President.
Another informational muscle said that the people who claim to be able to help the President would not fully understand how much the President responds.
Members of the White House, who are concerned, are seeking advice on the advice of their advisors in order to organize the support team.
According to those who explained the bones of this plan, this initiative was still in the early stages, but it was not clear whether or not it would be implemented in any manner.
However, it is believed that the organization's legal strategy and communication strategies, and the public's public opinion that the publication and the release of the criticized internal prosecution documents must be a clear leader who can organize public relations activities effectively.
According to this situation, it is clear that the lack of long-term strategic perspective is clearly visible.
According to a person who is involved in the investigation of Robert Moler's investigation, it is expected that the person who has been involved in this investigation is now more pressure than Robert Moler's investigation.
However, Luwandouski said that it was not accurate to suggest that he would become a leader of such efforts, and NBC News.
"We've been able to support the President and Policy for the last five years, but we've never met with President and close advisers."
Trump's external lawyer, J. S.C., was also involved in the promotion of the punishment.
In the interview with NBC News, Sesha said, "The problem is properly processed."
He was involved in the arrest of Clinton and left the White House to the end of Moler's investigation, and the current White House legal advisor, Pat Sipoonron, who had no experience in the White House, currently in the White House, has a lack of legal experience.
For more information about the strategy of the White House, the parties are generally aware that, in general, it is far far away from the building of human resources invitations and strategies, but organized and recognized that all people need to lead their efforts and political struggle.

it's possible to reduce emissions from biofuel research
In recent years, although the track of electric vehicles and Tesla, semi-finals are exclusive to news, it is the only aircraft to fly the sky, which is not able to reach renewable energy.
However, Professor of Alberta developed technology that could be used as a jet fuel.
Dr. David Bressler, professor at the University of Alberta Agricultural Sciences, started the project in 2003.
The professor's laboratory has developed hydrogen fuel from lipid waste such as oil fat, livestock rendering, canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low-quality oil fats to produce, and carbon emissions are less than 85% of crude oil base fuel.
This technology also acts as a reproduction of coal-fired hydrogen in crude fuel.
Dr. Bressler said, "This technology achieved in the first generation was a coal-fired hydrogen in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, traditional biofuel technology tends to be unstable at low temperatures, causing serious problems to move high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is something like Zirenma."
There is no value for diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bressler's laboratory focuses on two options as fuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires another treatment of coal-fired fuel and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue research on chemical reactions that maintain the stability of fuel at low temperatures.
Dr. Bressler commented on the second option, "It could be possible to test the chemical reaction in the reactor as a little change."
This option is high risk.
As the airline and Canada and the U.S. Army have increased investment in the available options, the subsidiary of the University of Alberta has been working on productization.
"They predicted that someone would take carbon taxes in the future."
In the worst case, I would like to prepare a draft.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmonton's waste management center, and recently, the company has invested 400 million US$2 million from Rockyd Martin as a support support for construction in Nelson Bra.
The plant plans to produce a biofueling plant every year.
Dr. Bressler said that carbon returns are about 85%, but the reason why the fuel transport method and the production method are not reduced.
"It's a technology shop."
My job is to create a option that allows you to achieve multiple options in parallel with the decision received.

The Ministers pointed out that Johnson's warning at the House of Representatives, and if the British failed to withdraw the EU, it would be said that the credit for Japan's political system would be destroyed.
"The Ministers say that if a vote of 100 million people in the referendum, 66% would vote for the EU, 100 million people would be disappointed."
Even if the voters opposed the withdrawal of 99 percent, they would not give up to 10 million people who were very angry to write letters to the House of Representatives.
It is not so much time for people to repeat the streets.
A senior minister added that if the second referendum would cover the results of the first round, there was a risk that the violent riots in the country would occur.
Johnson decides to take part in the general election and take the decision to the voters.
Johnson is reported to have faced a rebellion in the House of Representatives seeking to beat EU and hand in a compromise plan.

exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack.
It is shown in the latest study that the risk of the heart disease may be higher.
This is the result of a tracking survey for over 30 years in Hawaii.
Compared with men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is that when exposed to pesticides is exposed to work, it is important to note that there is a drug exposure in work and reduce the standard risk factors of heart disease."
Dr. Rodrigues is a professor of medical care at the University of Hawaii.
This is the result of the study of data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Ohushima, who participated in the KANA Honolulu Heart Program.
This study suggests that women and other races cannot be applied to women and other races.
Due to the long-term decline in pesticides, the effects of health may appear after years after exposure.
This study saw the greatest impact within ten years after exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between the exposure of pesticides and the heart disease in the work is no longer important."
This is probably because of the importance of other factors associated with aging, and in his later years he hides the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease.
Researchers found that exposure to low and middle concentrations of pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack is not important.

Los Angeles's lost dress, the Hampton Court Palace
It was made by the silver foil thread of the highest-class camtlet silk, and the luxury embroidery of plants, beasts, butterflies and butterflies.
He claims that the dress collection curator of the Royal Palace was one point.
It is said that one piece of cloth that had been placed on the wall of a small church in the countryside was placed there 100 years ago, and it seems to be part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
After three years after the discovery of this luxurious cloth used as the altar of the church in Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited near that room that could be worn over 450 years ago.
In addition to the remaining dress in the 16th century, it seems that it was an important discovery in the entire Royal dress collection.
Although Elizabeth did not have the perfect evidence of the dress through sleeves, he was convinced that the dress was not a town of royal ownership for three years.
Although it was prepared by the royal court only for senior members of the royal family, it was suggested that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen, and bearers were added later.
At that time the dress was made, it seems that the price was equivalent to the one-hour residence.
In the 1590s at the end of Elizabeth's morning, the queen was expected to be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, and the rivals wearing such luxurious clothing were not satisfied.
Mr. Lin told me that it was important to publish, so I came to see my colleagues.
Everyone looked at the cloth and said, "I'm really happy to always watch the Royal dress one."
The long second life of one of the dress used as the altar cloth of the church of the Bakton Church is not so much like expected.
Barton is a village of Bransh Paley, who served as a woman in the long life of Queen Elizabeth, and is said to have been associated with the local legend for a long time.
The dress was after the death of Paley's death in 1590, but the experts believe that Elizabeth died in 1603.
For more than 1000 hours of repair, the altar cloth, which was spent in a very delicate hands-up using silk and thin surgical needles, will be exhibited next to Elizabeth's portrait, which is one of the most praised contemporary paintings that have been loaned from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The vast space as much as possible as possible as part of the very expensive tatries was only renovated greenhouses on the Hampton Court, and the work was almost here, and Leeby Thompson said, "I feel really respected by the craftsmen who created it."
When you look at the embroidery on the back of the table, it is a great respect for those who made this.
I had never seen this sophisticated work ever before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held from 12 October at the Hampton Court Palace.

A single-point gap lawsuit, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
In July this year, the first oral statement of the trial that the voters wanted to invalidate the election was opened in the Fukuoka High Court Miyazaki Branch, where the gap was not correct.
The plaintiffs claim that this year, compared with the number of voters per member of the House of Representatives in July this year, the value of one vote is 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture, and only 0.48 votes in Kagoshima Prefecture.
On the 27th day at the Miyazaki Branch of Fukuoka High Court of Appeals, the plaintiffs claimed that the value of one vote was equal to inequality.
In response, the members of the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court asked the Court to reject the claim as "there was no doubt that there was a significant inequality that occurred in the case of a constitutional issue.
The judgment is passed on 30 October.

A large track of Isuzu's large track Giga, the latest model in the world... Tokyo Motor Show 2019 - Yahoo! News
Isuzu Motor Show 2019 will be held in Tokyo Big Sight from October 24 to November 4.
In addition to the latest advanced safety equipment, the Isuzu truck's flagship model, Giga also expanded its fatigue reduction equipment to the driver.
We will contribute to safety driving due to the warning brake that detects pedestrians and bikes, and the blind spots monitor and variable-modified LED head lamps that help prevent accidents and changes in the lane.
It also contributes to the improvement of the driver's fatigue due to the cruises of all cars that follow the front car at all speed.
In addition, the vehicle service management system also expanded the vehicle conditions.
The operation of safety equipment also monitors and supports safe operation.
It is also the world premiere of FL-IR, which represents the future logistics network as a show model.
FL-IR is similar to the contrast between ultrasound conversation and behavior, which is seen in fish, and connected and column driving.
It is characterized by the combination of bio-designs that give the image of efficient robots with a motif, and the contrast between the hard-quality Aero device that covers its surroundings.
The interior is equipped with a layer design that replaces dashboards with manual and automatic driving modes.
The seat is placed in the center and combines comfortable operation and housing.
It is also the first public in the world, but the next generation is the "EfEV Walk-through Bang."
In addition to zero-emissions and low noises, we also focus on improving the efficiency of the driver's labor environment and collection work.
By installing a rotating seat on the driver's seat, the driver supports the driving.
It also features a wide range of electronic mirror systems and 3Dsa round multi-views that can be seen around the vehicle.
In addition, Japan's first hybrid line bus, Elga duo, and a small track "elf," which has been developed by Sunno, presents a diesel 4JZ1 engine that combines the latest emission gas regulation and fuel efficiency.
In addition, we introduce the support of the operation support "PREISM" and the activities of natural gas vehicles.

We arrived at the unmanned supply and space base and catch up with robot arm | Shizuoka Shimbun
At the end of the International Space Station, the No. 8 was installed.
The robot arm of the station is growing from the left.
The International Space Station has successfully caught the 8th U.S. Space Station, and is pleased to announce that the JAXA staff members of the Tohoku University (JARC) - 28th (International Federation)
At the end of the 28th night, when the astronauts arrived near the station, they captured the robot arm.
The supplies were launched on 25th from the Seed Island Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and were gradually advanced by the control of the JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, the distance between about 10 meters is approaching.
The robot arm of the length 176m is flowing through the supply force.
There are approximately 5 tons of supplies.
After the installation of the station, the crew moved the luggage.
i've been involved in the three-thirds of Mexican drug trafficking.
After the sunrise of Chicago Westside, CBS News captured the rusher of drug trading.
Brian McQueen, a drug control agency (DEA) revealed what was happening in the white day.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died in excess drugs.
McQueen said that '90 percent of drugs were brought from Mexico.'
DEA focuses on the king of Mexican drugs, known as El Mencho and Nemecio Servantes.
Dr. Matthew DonahDEA, a member of Mexico, said, "Mancho is the top priority of the federal law enforcement agency."
The winning prize at El Mencho reached $1,000.
In response to the help of Donahh, hundreds of drug manufacturing bases in El Mencho were stormed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisko Nueba (CJNG) is involved in at least one third of the drug that is brought to the United States by land and seaways.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the same cartel has sold over a large amount of "co Cain, methane fetamin, Fentayl mixed Heroin."
El Mencho's neck is estimated to be $1 million.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California for 30 years, but was arrested and sent to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel.
He owns a huge amount of weapons, rockets, and 50 calibers.
In fact, his own special mobility team was owned by Donah.
After six deaths from the Mexican Army helicopters, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders have been reported to be due to the conflict of drug trafficking.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, about 94 murders occurred on 1 January.
In Chicago, it is necessary to wear protective clothes while handling the treatment.
In the manufacturing center, the paper of cocaine has been pushed by the seal of the dealer.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho drugs.
Donah said, "The Mencho is involved in the flow of harmful substances that are virtually captured by women and children's lives."
In other words, when someone died, he said, "It is likely to be a drug that was brought from El Mencho's organization."
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died of excessive intake.

The Council of the People's Republic hopes to continue (North Korean newspaper) - Yahoo!
As a result of the aging and aging population, on the island of Noo, No. 26 on the island of Noo, where the shop was reduced, the move was started by the "Notoshima Regional Development Council."
During the trial of December, the day-to-day wagons with daily goods, seasonings, food, and the first day, the Suso-machikaikaikai and the semi-ura town council.
There is also a quick sale of goods that have been sold over expectations, and the local residents asked the locals to choose "a fun choice of goods."
The wagons had 110 points, including the total vegetable, the city designated garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat one person's life, a total of vegetables such as potato salads that were divided into the pack, as well as a premium of 100 yen and affordable.
At the Susso-cho meeting, the people's columns were cut off by salt and sugar.
Mr. Nakamura, the chairman of the Council, said, "I didn't expect to sell it so much."
At the same time, Mr. Mizuta (83) of Notoshima Suso-machi, who is shopping at her husband's driving, said, "I don't know if my father can drive, and I would like to continue."
The user received orders such as "can coffee" rather than "cany coffee," but "I want to add coffee to myself."
The Council examines items that were requested by the Council.
At Noto Island, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily goods, and the Council tried to save the "marketless people."
From December to December, 20 towns in the island will be held every month, and after fiscal year, they will continue as business.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed the decision to further support the residents affected by drought.
The cash support policy for farmers with droughts has been extended, and the existing farmers' benefits are significantly visible.
In addition, about 30,000 million dollars were reported to the refugee support agency, and the target farmers were able to receive emergency assistance for up to 30,000 dollars.
As a result of the drought-free regional grant program, a total of 13 municipalities are supported by a total of $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought prevention measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion as a drought support.
Ronald Lee Hazkel: a former wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Hatzkel (39) was convicted in the spring of 2014, and was convicted of killing four of Steven and his children.
On July 9, 2014, Huskel was forced to enter the house and asked her to find out where her wife Melney Hazkel was located.
Melney was not absent, but his sister, Caty State and his family.
Huskel fired and killed Stephen State (39), his 13-year-old son, nine-year-old and seven-year-old daughter.
In the family, only one of them was 15 years old, and only one of them left their lives.
At that time, the authorities were seriously injured and reported, but then completely recovered.
On Thursday, the jury refused to claim guilty by the loss of the heart of Ronald Lee Haskel.
The jury was dismissed from the court until the monthly sentence was held.
"If you select us disappointed, you never forgive me."
Is the appeal of a girl who was struck by anger?
Global warming has increased significantly.
In the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, a 16-year-old environmental activist Gregta Tuhnberg spoke for strengthening measures.
As a result, the school's strike spread around the world, such as Bocott and sitting in front of the parliament.
The young people who raised anxiety and anxiety were engaged in a protest campaign throughout the world including Japan.
It is said that over 150 million people participated.
He also held a message board in Morioka.
The threat of climate change is closer.
The Paris Agreement, which launched a full-scale launch in 2020, aims to minimize the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the world in the latter half of the century and to lower the temperature rise in the industrial revolution.
We will take steps to implement all participating countries without distinction between developed countries and developing countries.
However, due to the relationship between climate change, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, abnormal weather points in various regions.
It is necessary to strengthen the efforts of one step toward global warming at a fast pace.
A long-term goal was to make a real zero by the 77 countries by 50.
In other 70 countries, the goal was to increase.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, China and India expressed the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not explicitly express the new goals, and the decline in the movement of the power of the nuclear power generation was in place.
The criticism of Japan's strong contribution to coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy shows zero emissions as early as the latter half of the latter half of the century, and the separation between countries that aim to achieve 50 years zero.
At the summit, Japan had no chance to speak.
In the meeting of the Environment-related meetings, Koryu-jijiro, who presented Japan's efforts on climate change, said, "It should be fun, cool and sexy."
Although the appeal is not denied, it is too poor than the appeal of the girls.
We don't have any opposition to Gerta, who is now a symbol of environmental movement.
The wound that cannot be discussed will not be replaced by the "pointing of the question."
The international community must respond to the common crisis of mankind.
There is no need to be sufficient effective for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Greta.
It's an adult to do so as to avoid the future.
it's a step to realize quantum internet
Based on the results of the U.S. Army's research, we approached the realization of quantum Internet.
In such Internet, it may be possible to secure military safety and provide measurement and measurement capabilities that were impossible for conventional networks.
According to the U.S. Army Research Center, the U.S. Army's Integrated quantum information center, researchers from Inssbrook University achieved a record of quantum distribution between material and light - using optical fiber cable.
Entangling is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If the two quantum bits are in the Entanguy state, even if the other quantum bits were measured in one another, the other quantum bits have been physically distant places.
"This distance [50 km] is a realistic distance than the past, and it is better to start building a quantum network between cities."
The city's quantum network is composed of networks between physical quantum bits in Entang, despite a large distance.
The distributed distribution of this Entangment is absolutely essential for the establishment of the quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize a large distributed Entangment," said Dr. Sara gambling, Deputy Secretary of the Army Program to support research.
In addition, the Entangification at the exit of the fiber is also sufficient to meet the number of conditions required for some difficult quantum networks.
The team started experiments with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
The researchers wrote quantum states on the ions using laser rays, and at the same time the quantum information was absorbed into the photons.
As a result, the quantum state of the atoms and the light particles became the Entangy state.
The challenge is to send the photon into a fiber fiber cable.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and the optical fiber cable is absorbed immediately."
At the same time, Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. A team sent the light particles through a non-linear crystal that emits strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted into 1550 nanometers, which are the standard wavelengths of current distance communication.
Later, the photon was sent through the fiber fiber cable of 50 km long.
In the measurement results, however, the atoms and light particles moved long distances, despite the conversion of the wavelength.
By using calcium atoms, calcium can be captured at the same time as high quality "watch" quantum bits, but this experiment results lead to the realization of a network of Entangling at long-distance atomic clocks.
A large Entangling watch network is a very important field for the Army from the viewpoint of accurate position measurement, navigation and application of time."
