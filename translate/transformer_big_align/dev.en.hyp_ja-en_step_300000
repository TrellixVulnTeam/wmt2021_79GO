Croatia is planning a nuclear treatment facility, Bosnians protest.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina to protest the Croatian plan to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near a river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The protesters in the town of Novi Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the remains of the barracks in Turgovska Gora, and vowed to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kursico.
The Bosnians, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," and "Don't stop it firmly."
We must oppose it.
Miloslav Driaka, head of the municipality of Novi Grad, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko Nuclear Power Plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss the expansion of waste treatment facilities next week.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had yet to decide whether to build its own storage facility, or whether Slovenia should pay for the amount of waste processed in newly constructed facilities.
Tomislav Chorich, Minister of Environment and Energy of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia has problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents of all ethnic groups in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location on its own near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the pockets of Bosnian pants - the Turkovska Gola - be the best place in Croatia?"
Don't let us hurt our self-esteem!

PayPay salesman "I'm on the Wave" "I'm on the Wave" cashless wake up "I'm on the Wave" Will the waves swell (Tokai TV) - Yahoo!
Tax increase starting in October.
In line with this, the country will start the cashless point reduction project.
It is to reduce up to 5% to reduce the coldness of consumption.
[See in the image] just before the tax hike... shops and businesses "cacheless introduction."
Therefore, what is happening now is "initial introduction."
It is a cashless store that used to be a cash business.
We adhered to the installation site.
[Cashlessing] immediately before the tax hike.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" in Chita City, Aichi Prefecture.
It is a popular shop operated by Takeshin Seika, and there are more than 100 kinds of Okaki and Ashi in the store.
Mr. Yasuda, a smartphone payment service that boasts 12.5 million users, visited Tatsushin on this day.
PayPay Yasuda: "Is there any payment method other than cash now?"
President Shinmi Takeyoshi: "No, we only deal with cash, old-fashioned ...."
PayPay Yasuda: "I wonder if the cash register will be rotated faster because it will not be possible to receive the tsurisen, and if you get used to it, it will be easier than cash."
Up to now, we have launched a 100 billion yen campaign to reduce 20% of our usage by points.
Although the number of users has increased dramatically, Yasuda is an "employee man" who sells the introduction of PayPay to customers, that is, the store.
"Okakiya Tatsushin" was a cash business until now.
The president also listened to Mr. Yasuda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay Yasuda: "It's really busy, and I think it's a peak now.If you're not able to talk to me before you jump in, or if you're going to do a consumer reduction business together, I'm going to register as a member of PayPay and I'm riding a wave now quite a bit."
Ride "Cashless Wave" in the country's consumer reduction business system!
Mr. Yasuda gave the reason to ride the waves to "Consumer Reduction Project" in Japan.
With the consumption tax increase from October, the government introduced a system to reduce up to 5% of the shopping amount to consumers to prevent the cold of consumption.
As in "Okakiya Tatsushin," there are few small and medium-sized retail stores that consider introducing cashless payments before the tax hike.

What is the representative Munichhausen syndrome that appeared in The Politicians of Netflix?
The symptoms are that parents and parents false that healthy children are ill.
The Politician is broadcast today on Netflix.
The drama is about Patton Hobart, the president of the United States, but the first step is to become the student council president of his high school.
The film was produced by American Horror Story and Gree creator Ryan Murphy, starring Gwinness Partlow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Bointon.
This is a mental illness that parents act as if they were physically or mentally ill, even though the person under the protection is not really sick.
There are many different types of pathologies, including Münchhausen syndrome, which is said to be a disease of himself.
However, the surrogate Münchhausen syndrome clearly implies that others under their protection are ill.
It is also known as FII, a type of child abuse.
It is a rare symptom, but usually parents exaggerate or cause symptoms, as if children are sick.
So what are the signs of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS points out the following cautions.
The child seems to be healthy, but if he is ill, he tries to persuade the medical practitioner.
It can be described as exaggerated or false.
The test results are fabricated to make the child feel sick, such as mixing glucose into the urine sample and showing it to be diabetes.
Excessive medications and other drugs can cause disease symptoms.
How general is Muhnhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
A study published in 2000 estimated that 89 out of 100,000 people had developed in two years.
what should we do if we suspect children's damage?

Nigeria: Police investigations into caduna schools, rescue 300 children
The Kaduna Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
Police say that children were placed in an inhuman environment, but the school denied this claim.
The residents, who call themselves the school's pastor, say, "All children are in school with parental consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering the school, parents signed their consent.
Parents come to deliver meals to their children every day, so they know what kind of environment they are in.
I was very surprised to have closed the school after the police came and took the kids away and all the food the parents had delivered.
There are parents who can testify to whether the police had left children in such a terrible environment, but this is unfair treatment."
He adds that Abdullahman, former head of the National Police Agency, once visited to see what kind of environment the children were, but never complained.
It is also said that children can learn Koran and that's all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Sabo said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the state government.
"In the name of acquiring knowledge about Koran, they were placed in an inhuman environment.
Many children were injured in the back.
So I'm investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

The man told the girl, "Don't speak loud.
If you don't mind, you'll have to do it."
The man had a knife on his right hand, tied the girl's hands and feet with cable tie, and then hit the tree and abused it for nearly an hour.
When a man broke the cable, the girl ran into the school crying like crazy.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m., with several phone calls and phone calls from his colleagues.
The man stood out with mud, grass, and trees on his clothes, and was involved in street violence, and when he chased the driver to the bush, he claimed that he had fallen by hand.
The trial will continue on Tuesday.
Pope, warning IT representatives that AI development is based on public interests
On Friday, Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors that the competition for artificial intelligence and other digital development would increase social injustice if not accompanied by ethical assessments of public interests.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethicists met.
In the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a small number of scholars and Catholic bishops were also invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the conference, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increased mechanical work, while case studies were conducted on gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the responses of social media companies during the atrocities.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
However, he warned that if he relied too much on robotics to pursue profits, he could take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technology advances cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it will not be the right true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will go back to a kind of savage state based on the theory of the strong.
According to the organizers of the conference, they want to take advantage of the expertise of the participants in the meeting to find a person who can become a future advisor to the Catholic Church on the high-tech field.

Real Madrid loan players Martín Udegor and admirable fans
Martin Woodegor was surprised by Michel O'Yarsabar's preemptive assist.
Real Madrid beat Ossana in 2-0, breaking the national record for the season and reaching the top of the La Liga rankings.
However, this season, despite not losing one game at La Liga, director Ginedine Zidane is under tremendous pressure, due to the intense open battle and the inconsistency with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the Champions League, pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniol is one of the future stars of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, another young Norwegian Martín Udegor, who was loaned to Real Socieda, also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socieda against Araves, was surprised by Michel O'Yalsabar's preemptive assist, and Real Socieda won 3-0 home.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, was a dribble that pulled the opponent's crotch and sent an exquisite pass through the inside of another two players to Oyal Sabal, where he scored the goal with this completely accurate slew ball.
With the second goal of Willian José and the third goal of the stunning Oyalusabal penalty spot, Arabes' midfielder Manu Garcia secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just five minutes before leaving.
Martin Udegor joined Real Madrid in 2015 at the age of 16, but struggled to demonstrate his reputation.
The young Norwegian, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally developed his own territory.
Anna Hazale and Sharad Powerl were surprised at the fraudulent financing of the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When the lawsuit came in contact, Sharad Powerle's name was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerl in the Maharashtra Cooperative Bank Fraud incident involving tens of thousands of rupees.
The investigative agency's executive branch (ED) filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Powerl and his nephew Ajit Powerl, former deputy minister of Maharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Financial Cleanup Prevention Act, an executive report comparable to the police's primary report was registered by the central authorities.
The lawsuit is based on the Mumbai Police First Report charged with the name of the former chairman of the bank, Ajit Powerl and the former staff of the 70 co-operative banks.
When the lawsuit came in contact, the name of Sharad Power was nowhere.
An executive lawsuit and suspicion that Sharad Powerl was involved in the fraud, Anna Hazale said on Thursday that "they only know how Sharad's name emerged and who referred it."
Anna Hazare, critic of Sharad Powerl, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted a detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazare, a veteran of numerous anti-corruption activities, said, "The executive will know how his name emerged in this incident."
Sharad Powerl denied any misconduct, claiming that it had nothing to do with the joint bank, and questioned the timing of filing a lawsuit just weeks before the October 21 elections in Maharashtra.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, declaring that he would not surrender before Delhi's "kingdom."
The NCP called the action by the Executive Bureau a political abbreviation.

Stepping the accelerator pedal eliminates accidents!
The following four devices are available: Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by a mistake in driving.
Among them, accidents caused by brake and accelerator mistakes by elderly drivers are on an increasing trend.
Especially when it comes to sudden departure, it becomes panic, and sometimes the accelerator is still stepping on the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with safety driver support function to cover such errors, but there is also a rearing device that can be attached to an unattended car.
The system is developed and sold by after-sales parts manufacturers.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and it is stepping on at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] From a new perspective, it is "e-ACCEL ALARM" developed by Pivot.
It is to avoid pedal mistakes with "an alarm sound."
The mechanism generates an alarm sound when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake of the brake when stopping or driving at low speed.
It is to react to the sound and encourage the accelerator to return, and to avoid rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the mistake of stepping.
It is difficult to understand changes in engine sound due to the mistake of stepping on the accelerator, and it is effective for elderly drivers who can hear easily.
It is attached to the OBDII connector, and the body is only attached with double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is affordable, and it is also attractive that you need to set up.
[Ashimo Watching Kun] The World Wing started its launch in mid-September with the Ashimo Watching Kun, an accelerator brake step prevention device.
It is also possible to move back without moving forward.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is stepped rapidly, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and the accelerator opening is electrically suppressed to suppress the rapid advance.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I did not tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantaneously controlled the advance by turning it into a creeping driving state (the state that left the brake in the D range).
It also has a function to detect the speed of approximately 5Km/h or more at the time of retreat (back) and force the vehicle to be cleaned up.
Installation is possible only with couplerion and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

"Shirakishi Town Childcare Support Circle Haguhagu" (Representative of Tomoko Tanaka) opened a discussion on the experiences and lessons of the Saga Torrential Disaster at Ariake Public House in Sakata, town on July 27.
About 20 mothers who are raising children consider the form of disaster prevention suitable for each family and summarize their awareness and requests to local governments.
Mr. Saori Kusumoto (32) of Kitamachi, Takeo City said that three-year-old children who liked the nursery school suddenly lost their desire to go to the nursery school after the flood, and they began to stay at night.
"It's because adults are busy cleaning up the house and have not had enough time to face it," he said, "I want to prepare for a disaster so that adults can not panic and say "OK."
Yukari Ogushi (36) of Shiraishi Town spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families, including three-year-old children.
He said, "If you have a child who can't stay still, you will use your mind around you."
A woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children between 4 and 12 years old, was watered around her house.
"I can't run away with five people," he said, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in a disaster and have food and a simple toilet.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the necessary preparation changes in the situation of family structure and residence."
Ms. Shinako Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a child of 6 and 8 years old, proposed that "the elementary school had a closed school e-mail the previous day, but the nursery school had no communication network or mail system, and there should be a uniform mail transmission system."
There were also requests to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed from before, and I can't understand "the last time was okay."I want to prepare for disasters by taking care of small ingenuity and connections with people."
President Tanaka said, "I will also consider communicating opinions to the government as a group."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Arcuri has been questioned by the police authorities.
The IOPC will examine whether or not Prime Minister Johnson should investigate the alleged misconduct of the Mayor of London in violation of the Penal Code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts of conduct" on suspicion that Mr. Arcuri had received preferential treatment from friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"A matter of conduct exists if there is information that indicates that a crime may have been committed," says GLA.
This was never proven.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate this matter.
The issue was entrusted to the IOPC, but the IOPC is an agency that responds to accusations made by the English and Welsh police.
The problem was entrusted to the police supervisory authority because Johnson was in a position comparable to the Chief of Police at the time.
Johnson denied any misconduct related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he was going to follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information on his relationship with Arcuri, while claiming it was "a misconception."
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it seems that the press had received preferential treatment for U.S. citizens who had emigrated to London seven years ago, paying £126,000 from public money during the Mayor of London, and joining three foreign trade delegations with Johnson.
The government has since frozen a £100,000 grant to Hacker House, a company under investigation.
The company will be asked puzzled questions about the investigation process done before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Wahman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "regular proper assessment" and that the company owns a British telephone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Aculi (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessman was "public secret among the staff."
The move of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police supervisory authority touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack," and the timing of the night before the Conservative Party was "too pro-party."
"The supervisory authority has not submitted any evidence on any charges, and the prime minister has not been given the opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority prior to the press release issued late on Friday night."
Both the public and the mass media will be able to see the political Kyogen that has been created by the amazon.
Earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the friendship between Johnson and California businessmen, supported by the London Tourism and Regional Promotion Division, was "public secret."
The former staff of London and Partners (L&P) stated that despite some who considered the company "untrustworthy" at that time, Arcuri had the privilege of attending trade-related talks abroad led by Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used by ordinary people to form property!
Today is the 20th anniversary of the Sawakami Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Sawakami Toshin, about the future prospects.
The Sasakawa Fund celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
Looking back on the past 20 years, what do you feel now?
First of all, there were many people's thoughts and efforts in 20 years of history.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all those involved, not to the history that has only been achieved by the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" came up with the idea of "supporting the formation of property of ordinary people."
This spirit has remained unchanged for 20 years.
If the general public resolves from anxiety about money, the world will become brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operations do not yield results unless they walk with beneficiaries.
When the market plunges, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble, the "Sawakami Fund" comes in a lot of money.
I feel that we have understood the message that we have always said, "We will support companies that are needed in the world at this time."
The result is a 20-year long-term long-term fund and we believe it is because we continue to be a direct sales system that can deliver messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
Generally speaking, just by telling the results, the information about what you are buying now is black box, but "Sawakami Fund" has all been disclosed.
This is why we can trust you.
mc. miller's death, the third drug arrester is key.
Los Angeles (AP) - A third man was arrested and charged for drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller of overdose of drugs last year.
According to the court records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit tablets of oxycodon containing fenthanyl, which Mr. Miller had previously held before he accidentally overdose cocaine, alcohol and fenthanyl and died last September.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Petitt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record released on Tuesday, Petitt was getting drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Levis, arrested earlier this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, is accused of delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Mr. Miller, and there is still a defense against individual cases.
Walter, currently in detention, was under probation for a drug case in 2005, and he was sentenced to five months in prison for violating his compliance.
The first public prosecutor in charge of the case, reported by Celebrity Site TMZ on Thursday, called for Walter to be detained until the trial began due to the high possibility of escape from abroad.
There was no immediate reply to the answering machine.
Petitt was indicted by the Federal Court on 4 September, but the defense counsel refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics contain frank words about depression and drug use, and he has earned fans as one of the great palaces in the hip hop world.
Miller's real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, who broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a love-loving mirror video to his Instagram account and published a song called "Sancue Next" with affection for Miller.
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in connection with recent opioid drug abuse.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, also died of drug overdose in 2016 and found fenthanyl and hydrocodon in the body.
In this article, Walter's name was corrected by Stephen rather than Steven.
developed over 30 mobile games for nineyearolds in nigeria
These nine-year-olds are using a free programming app called Scratch 2 to create hide-and-do games.
Scratch 2 allows you to create games, anime, and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
The player gets points when they catch the bats that come out of the hiding place.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Basil told CNN that he spent time building games when he was bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, sponsored by Codefest International, was introduced to give children like Basil the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Clash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, his interest in making games grew.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was too obsessed with the game, so I was a bit angry," his father said.
I was so frustrated that I said, "I'm always playing games, but what if I make a game myself so that others can play it?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't think Basil really care."
Since then, Basil, who was interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step in game production.
Basil-chan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, bears the name of his game as it is.
One of the games, "Mosquito mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The youth population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if it becomes African innovation, young people like Basil take the initiative.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians have been awarded the award by creating robots that use program code to organize household chores.
In May 2019, Akrobo, a female high school team from Ghana, who programmed boxed robots, won the Robofest Contest.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil-chan and children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, convicted of bribery.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to falsely testify to federal agents investigating corruption related to major political donors.
In the federal court case list, Robin Hayes is convicted next Wednesday.
According to a fact-based document prepared as part of a judicial transaction and signed by Hayes' attorney, Hayes was aware of false statements to FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which sin Hayes admits.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return for special treatment, the prosecution sued former Congressman Hayes for involvement in the insurance company's plan to fund the state's insurance director.
Greg Lindbergh and two co-owners were accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cosey.
Lindbergh is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated over $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016 and has recently become the state's top political donor.
Lindbergh supported Republican principles and politicians, but also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindbergh's lawyer asked for a comment by email on Friday, but did not respond.
On Friday, Hayes' attorney, Kearns Davis, also received an email asking for additional comments, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes said he had never spoken to Cosey about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to a factual document, Hayes actually spoke with the State Insurance Supervisor about a request from Lindbergh to transfer personnel within the Insurance Department.
The prosecution said Hayes helped Lindbergh's request for a meeting with Cosey, and also discussed direct bribes with the supervisor.
The indictment, published in April, claimed that Lindbergh had sought special treatment for his insurance business, and had planned to hold up to $2 million in his campaign to re-election in 2020.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for replacement of officials who had reviewed Lindbergh's company.
Republican Corsey reported suspected attempted bribery to federal agents and helped them stand.
Cozy has no suspicions.
The indictment described in a conversation, including Lindbergh and Cosey, that Lindbergh co-owners instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cozy's re-election campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially objected to the fact that he would pay attention if he did so much money, but he eventually broke up in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "I will do whatever you want."
okay, i'll do it.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office of Public Prosecutors requested an email to provide detailed information on judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aiming to improve user's happiness, like! number hidden test plan
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's sense of happiness, some users will soon like to post others!
This change, following the launch of a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, makes Good! an individual and only Posters appear.
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy director, Mia Garrick, said that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who consider the number of likes to be the cause of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "We had very positive feedback from a number of affiliated bullying groups and mental health organizations."
It only removes numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchanges rather than the number of likes and reactions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more securely than they feel competitive.
Garrick said that business operators on Facebook also receive the same metrics and insights they've accessed so far.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., the test is conducted in the same way.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test will end or if it will remain unchanged.
"There was initially positive feedback on Instagram experience, but now it's a stage to listen and learn to feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very aggressive "technologically familiar" Facebook and Instagram user.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

"Holder Part (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!News
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag, and I couldn't move anywhere.
If the fittings of your favorite bag are broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to use it.
Cando's handcrafted parts helped me at that time.
when i gave up saying, don't sell anymore
Her mother's broken bag, the first is the ultimate Petit Pra product.
Therefore, if you ask the store for repair, it became a situation that greatly exceeded the main price.
My mother unfortunately said, "I'm sorry, but I didn't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the home center and looked for a replacement for this fitting.
However, even if there are ring-shaped fittings, all of them are silver color.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Cando, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it at the handicraft corner.
as expected, everything will be matched.
It is originally a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
It is planned to be used one by one at both ends of the bag handle, and we bought two items.
Although the size of the ring is small, if you align it with the bag fittings on one side left, make it exactly the same ...!
This paved the way for bag repair.
It is attached immediately.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor and cramped ...
So I decided to make the ring a couple.
The metal fittings increased, but because of the lightweight parts, there is no problem with weight at all.
Rather, I feel that the number of sparkling parts increased and leveled up in design.
Aso, an express train of Japan National Railways, is on a temporary train Hiroshima - Kumamoto, a 10-hour trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train with the image of the JNR express "Aso" = 28 days
People who enjoy a special train trip inspired by the express train "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A temporary train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
On the morning of the same day, about 240 railway fans boarded a blue 12-car train from Hiroshima Station, and departed for Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
Aso was a night train that connected Kumamoto and Tokyo in 1950-80.
The tour was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the "Kumamoto Destination Campaign" organized by JR companies, a tour of Japan was organized.
The train is a seven-car train that runs along the Sanyo Line, Chikuho Line, and Kagoshima Line.
A special headmark was drawn on Mt. Aso.
his brother was sentenced to life for the honor murder of kandir barochi, a Pakistani social media star.
Candir Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was strangled in July 2016.
A Pakistani social media popular, Candir Barochi's brother, was convicted of murdering his sister on Friday and sentenced to life in prison for the most popular "honorary murder" in Pakistan.
He was strangled in July 2016 by a famous self-portrait photograph - which is not as big as Western standards, but was provocative in Pakistan, which is a very strong contempt for women.
His brother, Muhammad Vasam, was arrested.
His brother said in a press conference a few days later that he had killed his sister, of course, and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Sardar Memood, a lawyer, told AFP that a court in the eastern city of Murtan convicted and sentenced him to life in a waiting sentence.
"Inshira (God's will) will be acquitted in the Supreme Court," the lawyer said.
Prior to this, Barochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Barochi's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as a result of neglecting the rules of father-right society, the voices of victims, most women, are rekindled to seek action against the so-called "honorary murder."
Women have been burned, shot, stabbed or strangled in crimes such as choosing their own marriage partner, or appraising their sexuality and exposing their family to shame.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisas and Deya laws allow perpetrators to be pardoned by relatives of the victims.
Three months after Barochi's murder, Congress passed a new bill requiring life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, it is up to the judge's discretion to determine whether a murder is an honorable crime, and the murderer can theoretically claim another motive and may be pardoned.
In Barochi's case, his parents initially insisted not give his son a pardon.
However, his parents changed their minds and asked him to forgive him.
With international hatred of murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented steps to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Barochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a red dress with a wide chest on Valentine's Day.
Although it became critical and threatening, it was recognized by many people, including young people, that the creation of a new heaven and earth in a country where expressing oneself as an existence such as Kim Kardashian is considered a bold political activity to improve the status of women.
The roots of "honorary" murder are ethnic social norms, which still remain widely throughout South Asia, particularly affecting women's behavior, although men may be victims.

There was no large tsunami, and most of the refugees returned home without moving to a second evacuation site with accommodation facilities and facilities.
As a preparation for similar disasters, countermeasures against severe cold periods and wind and rain were one of the issues.
Seats that can cover the whole body during evacuation and relieve cold and wind rain.

In addition to actively cooperating in projects carried out by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish mutual support systems in terms of health management and prevention of injuries, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both groups mediate and send trainers and instructors when training related to sports and share information.
When teams from remote islands participate in tournaments outside the island, they work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of trainers in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, a general incorporated association of Kagoshima Prefecture, which is affiliated with the ASA, during tournaments on the mainland, such as the prefectural tournament, we will support the athletes to prevent the performance of the athletes from falling due to fatigue on board trips and consecutive nights.

Kenichiro Mogi "Now is the era where conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo!News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Mogi has been thinking twice as much about "mote."
"The Theory of Brain Science" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and the latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the first part (see related article), Mr. Shigeki extorted that the incompetent otoko stick to the conventional "man's fantasy" and that the pattern learning for mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the second part, we talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool and cool guy.
if you are bound by what you should do
In the first part, we talked about how "coolness" constantly evolves, so we need to look at various works and behavior of people and learn patterns every day.
When you learn patterns, you will be able to live in comfort because the brain systemizes the behavior by doing this better.
I think I'm evolving every day, apart from whether I'm "mote" or not.
So it is easy to live.
I was taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, so I talked a lot with young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful if you stick to the old pattern of being a university teacher is more dignified.
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say "I should do this" or "I should do this," you will survive.
Because people and society change without changing themselves.
I've talked about that in my recent interview book, Living - No matter how terrible the world is.
The "heavyness" and "authority" are things that come out naturally by admitting that person.
It's not that easy.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
What was Takeshi doing at the Cannes Film Festival?
Although he is light, his surroundings will be treated as "a wonderful filmmaker."
If you have a track record, you don't have to act great.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," it is not easy.
As far as I have heard from a variety of women, regardless of position or age, "cute" for any man seems to be an excuse and salvation.
It is difficult to wonder what this "cute" is.
what is it?
Nigeria's illegal northwest, doubles to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's Friday announcement, in the past four months, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria has doubled to about 40,000 due to intensified violence.
According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, a new $35.5 million fund-raising activity will be required by each institution.
UNHCR spokesman Barrok said that Bokoharam, an Islamic extremist organization that has been working on anti-government activities in northern Nigeria for ten years, has nothing to do with the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, increased violence in Nigeria over the past ten months in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina was caused by organized armed groups.
"We often show the fear of illegal and unstable situations," Barrok said on Friday to the press.
The media reported that kidnapping, torture, robberies, murder and sexual violence were frequent, and raiders destroyed houses and worked on theft.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime groups in the area.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoharam and the West African branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," says Balok.
What they bring is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR stated in a statement that the security situation, especially in Sokot, was deteriorating, and refugees across Niger were expected to increase in the coming months.

According to Polk County Court records, Marvin Escobar Orellana (31) was indicted for first-class murder in three cases under the false name of Marvin Eskibel Lopez, who was initially referred to as the police.
He pleaded guilty.
According to the police, he shot Rossibeth Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and her son (5) in a house in Des Moines on July 16.
In court records, the date of the trial will be decided on January 27 to give the plaintiffs and defendants more time to prepare.

The Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) has launched an advertisement for header binding by "Prebid.js" in LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to the needs of each advertiser.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header biding is a system in which multiple bidders (advertisers) compete in fair bids to deliver high-priced ads preferentially to media operated by media companies.
It has been introduced mainly by major media as a solution that is transparent to media companies and is expected to improve profitability.
In the past, we have been providing advertising frameworks through SSP.
In recent years, in response to requests from advertisers that "we want to deliver to specific ad frames that have high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," LFP, in cooperation with media companies, started in December last year to directly purchase ad frames to meet the needs of advertisers.
This time, the introduction of LFP will be expanded by supporting header binding.
As a benefit for advertisers, LFP header bids allow them to participate directly in bids for header bids, thereby improving the delivery of ads.
In addition, because the target media companies are limited, the advertisement frame of the destination according to the individual commercial materials and brand image is secured, preventing damage to brand value.
One of the advantages for media companies is that LFP's "wrapper solution," a solution that manages the code of each bidder company, can be implemented with the hope of introducing media companies.

Cabinet Revolts Requests Boris Johnson to reduce demands for EU withdrawal and to make compromises with the EU The Sun
Now that only three weeks have passed since the EU summit meeting, there is a growing concern around the prime minister that the prime minister may be out of time to withdraw substantial concessions.
Boris Johnson is faced with a cabinet revolt that seeks to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and compromise with the EU.
Negotiations on a new tariff system that replaces the Irish border-related backstop clauses are clogged, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative to "impossible."
The Senior Ministers hope that the EU's black curtain led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel will propose a compromise proposal on the ground, including a three-year time limit on the backstop, to the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Sun spoke to three ministers who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the next Conservative Annual Conference in Manchester.
They will demand that the prime minister abandon the "extreme" strategy of threatening the EU, devised by the senior advisor Dominique Cummings, and insist that the EU accept the offer to withdraw at a time limit.
One of the Ministers called the Supreme Court's ruling on Tuesday that the closing of Congress was illegal, and said, "At present, the compromise is the only way we can leave on October 31."
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister shall use whatever is available from his steps.
Even if it becomes radical, there is no effect, and Cummings' plan clearly fails.
We cannot fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to implement an agreement with former Prime Minister Terryza May if not yet.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will tell Boris to return Terryza's proposal to the House."
There are a number of reasons for this, and everyone is trying to end it.
If there is no delay, Boris is over and we are all over.
Sir John Mayer accused Boris of not seriously considering negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party, in a harsh speech, said: "The prime minister wants to sign an agreement with the EU.
However, we have not seen the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to form an agreement.
Instead, we saw the prime minister in Scotland fighting bulls, inspecting eggs in the Whales, and discussing with the people on the street - as if the election campaign was in full swing."
The prime minister's spokesman yesterday acknowledged that the agreement was still a long way ahead, saying, "No one can make a mistake - if it is to achieve the goal, the journey is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which would force a three-month postponement in case of an uncontracted withdrawal, would "make our negotiating position much weaker" in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the prime minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue their progress despite the passage of the bill."
Stephen Berkeley, Minister of Departure of the European Union, returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two deliberate on how food and livestock are regulated in Ireland.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly revealed in his Glasgow accent that he was told by TV station bosses that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, "I was so nervous," Kelly, 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was 25 years old and I was very nervous," she says.
I worked as an investigator at the BBC Scotland branch, and my boss told me that your Glasgow accent would never succeed in the television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone on the TV-am team and to see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget Ann Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing legendary actress Betty Davis that morning.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my favorite place is here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for local newspapers in East Kilbride, Scotland, and became a reporter for the TV-am Scottish branch in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Davelake, and later began a program named Lorraine.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, she presents a special program that looks back on Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews.
" passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity" were the secret to survival in the television industry, and the moderator said, "You have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
Do what you should do, get interested and interested in various people.
Looking back on the news that struck her heart, Kelly revealed that the Dunbrane shooting incident was "very painful."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think many of the families of children who were killed or injured watched us live broadcast the show from Dunbrane.
Pam Ross, one of her mother's five-year-old daughter Joanna was killed, personally told me to meet me, so we talked for hours at her house.
Not taking it all on the show, I went to Joanna's funeral, Pam and I've been friends since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Gerry McCann's daughter Madeleine were missing, stating that it was "very painful" and "very respecting the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painful and spooky net that they do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really sorry.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 a.m. on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, Chiwenga, fearing a trap.
According to high-ranking government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined the offer of the presidency from former President Robert Mugabe in the midst of a political change due to anxiety that it might be a trap to defy military action in November 2017.
During the coup, the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week that Mugabe offered Chiwenga to cede the presidency as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the Defense Forces.
However, Chiwenga declined the offer, not because of anxiety, but because he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform leaders and African Unions around the world that he had been stripped of his government in a coup.
In a series of tweets by Jamwanda2, which confirms that officials are senior officials of the President's Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is willing to cede the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munnagagwa," it is said that intense negotiations were held at that time.
The government official said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, made contact with Chiwenga by messengers.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three persons.
President Spokesman George Charamba, former deputy head of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, Aaron Nepera, and Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Muconoli, were involved in negotiations, and high officials said.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, was one commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat alone to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces Tiwenga.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death, attempted to denounce military action by the African Union, seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to cede the presidency to the former CDF was not due to the choice of the former president.
"It was an act of abandonment to save the dangerously rapid expansion of the situation, starting to get tired of part of the late president's family," he wrote.
However, there was a little political aim of the late president, who wanted to change the flow at least diplomatically.
If it were to destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the African Union's view of the coup, but remember that the commanders had declared that they would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would be trapped and crushed the claims of the commanders claiming that the constitutional order was not broken.
The late President Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, would decide whether to position it as a coup, would eventually be called a coup, and that military intervention requests would be considered valid.
That was the intent and calculation underlying this offer.
The authorities say that Mugabe moved when he realized he was not protected by the defense forces.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write a resignation letter.
The commanders of the military told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the presidential house called Blue Roof, they would not turn guns on the citizens.
At that point, Mugabe said he wanted two things: to protect his family, and to prove his military deprivation.
The commanders and commanders of the time accurately read their intentions.
A powerful metaphorical expression was used in the words of a messenger (gono), who told the president's desperate message: "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa (we belong to the camouflage group, the military), and we are not politicians or just in political competition."
The Army told the other commanders of the region that through the military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the objective was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coup and successors, Mugabe attempted to bring back Munangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed assistance from the region.
Not only had economic power and regional power, but because then President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the South African Development Community, South Africans, who were key to this process, refused to intervene, but repeatedly threatened behind it, clarified that the South African army would be immediately sent to Harare if the military invaded the presidential residence.
"Just because it was not supported by President Putin and African leaders, it did not come to fruition," the sources tell the Independent.
The second atomic bomb in the United Nations appeals to ban nuclear weapons ratification in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[Joint New York] On the 26th, a meeting was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.
Five new countries ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that day, totaling 32 countries and regions.
The treaty requires ratification of 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the 26th International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, set by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also delivered a speech, expressing strong concern that in recent years there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

China needs strong leadership, otherwise collapse - policy documents
Prior to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday.
In a white paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party's administration 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast and complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China will face division and collapse, and will be a catastrophe for the world."
As necessary for national stability, Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratic movement in Beijing in 1989.
President Xi Jinping, who will play the leading role in the commemoration ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held on Tuesday, has strengthened the party's control since the latter half of 2012.
Xi has also overseen military modernization programs that threaten the area.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development models, nor does it intend to adopt a model of other countries, nor does it merely seek peace rather than supremacy.
The Chinese people's genes do not invade or control the world.
In modern times, China was bullied by the powerful, and war and chaos left a deep scar with that pain; China would never take the pain he had experienced to others.
China is facing difficult problems such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in Chinese Hong Kong.
The White Paper states that China will never "abandon" its core interests and will not allow its security and sovereignty to be undermined.
"The threat of trade wars and rising tariffs do not lead to any problem solving," White Paper states in relation to trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market space and momentum of strong economic development.
"It will never weaken in the trade war," White said.
I am convinced that China is capable of facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities and opening a new world.
Since China has no idea of countering the United States at all, and does not want to replace the United States, the United States should take the development of China calmly.
The United States cannot control China, and it is even more unlikely that China will stop its development.
If you try to suppress, suppress, and move domestic contradictions abroad, the United States will not maintain strength.

In the future, Taiki Takayama will be acting as the coach and the director (responsibility teacher) will decide promptly.

The Spice Girls' Mel C, eating disorders, and eating disorders prevented dieting at home.
The Spice Girls' Melanie Chizom admitted that diets were banned at home, with his own experience of eating nothing but fruit and vegetables for many years.
Sporty spices, under pressure from members of the global pop group, have been "excessive exercise" for many years without having enough food, and have subsequently been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chisom said that his experience had influenced his daughter Scarlett's child-rearing, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"Scarlet is now 10 years old, and it's getting more attention to his appearance," Mel says.
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was able to be very careful when talking with my daughter.
Positive words, now it's habits.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of the Spice Girls, still in front of SNS, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that "bad" comments about himself written in the press led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself properly, I pulled out certain food groups, became more and more obsessed with exercise, and I was too thin," Mel said.
I was sick, and that condition lasted for about a few years."
Same-sex marriage justice judgment The opportunity to broaden diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court's Maoka Branch made a decision to approve the case in which 'in fact marriage (internal marriage) ' that conforms to marriage was established even between same sex.
More than 20 countries recognize same-sex marriage, and there is a system in which local governments, such as Sapporo City, recognize same-sex partnerships, which are not legally effective in Japan.
Based on this, the court recognized the fact that two women were actually married.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to grant legal protection to same-sex couples and is meaningful.
The same-sex marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Registration Law.
I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights and security of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system to recognize diverse families.
The women lived together for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the United States.
The decision was based on the results of the two living together and recognized "the reality that is not the same as true marriage between men and women."
It is an epoch-making decision to extend the recognition of actual marriages with the same-sex rights, such as social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that defines marriage as "only based on the consent of both sexes."
It is important to note that "the same-sex marriage was not expected at the time of establishment, so it is not understood as the purpose of denying same-sex marriage."
Although the Constitution does not assume same-sex marriage, it is expected that it will be a driving force for same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, since same-sex marriage was not permitted, the issue remained that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection differ from those of men and women."
It is difficult to distinguish the right to protect, while recognizing the reality of equal status between men and women.
According to a nationwide survey of domestic trends for married women, 70 percent of respondents believed that same-sex marriage should be recognized by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, if law is bound by traditional family images, it will take away the rights of those who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a legal spouse, so there are still few restrictions, such as being unable to receive preferential treatment in the tax system and not having joint custody.
In consideration of same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, such as expanding legal rights for same-sex marriage and expanding legal rights for actual marriage.
to the trial and jury trial of former athletes prosecuted for rape of multiple women.
A jury trial is held in the trial of former Delaware University baseball players accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and argument, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
A 21-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted after she drove Conaway home.
The two met after three weeks at the meeting site Bumble, where Conaway sent her nude pictures to women.
Conaway was charged with sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that women resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense argued that women were inconsistent and misrepresented, and that women had regretted having physical relations.

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, obviously in video
Sydney Harbour is one of Sydney's largest tourism resources, bringing $2109 million to the Australian economy every year.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 cups of contaminants in the Olympic pool every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions can be said to be one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video titled "From Sydney Harbour to Down," the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with husks, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes lost by someone, and even animal corpses - all flowing rainwater into Sydney Harbour.
Among them, plastic is the biggest factor in clotting waterways.
Coincidentally, in a video released on September 27, the day of world tourism, Dr. Katherine Dafoon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
Although its appearance is certainly beautiful, it is one of the highly modified and polluted estuaries of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, 1560 kilograms of plastic per hour is expected to flow into the waterway, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"There were heavy rains several times, but Sydney Harbour after that ... was quite tragic," Dr. Daforn said.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
However, it is a part of the iceberg, and under the surface of the Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited on the seabed.
"If you really don't go down the sea level, you don't know what's there," said owner Richard Nichols, Dave Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what's under the surface of the water), I think everyone will be really surprised.
Although overwhelming, more than half of what we discover is plastic bags.
The remaining half is plastic at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and no one can believe that all of these plastics and garbage are flowing right under the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said that local residents and tourists may be able to reduce the amount of plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source.
It reduces plastic usage, recycles better, and eventually flows into the ocean, so you need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a source of food.
But we can repair Sydney Harbour and return it to its old form, which is very simple.
killing the sea means killing people.
A new study on plastics and mental health was also presented this month, coincided with the release of the video funded by the recycling company TOMRA, as part of a broader awareness of environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of 546 children between the ages of 12 and 18 have a feeling of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent believe that disposable plastic waste is an adult's fault.
The study also stated that 93 percent of 551 parents surveyed were increasingly worried about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.

For me, actor Hideki Takahashi transcends his father and is like a teacher.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
What I am doing is different, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to gain knowledge, and what is important as a working person.
After 120% of my efforts, I finally became an announcer of the TV station, but when I was told to be a connor or a busaik, my father said, "If I thought it was a connor, but it wasn't so.
Then, around the 2nd to 3rd year of joining the company, "Anyone with an empty girl can do it," and even when I did not get motivated because I wanted to do the work I wanted to do, even when my heart was rotten, "Anyone should do the work hard."If so, "I asked everyone to do it, but I was glad that I was in charge of Mama.

In the workshop, members of the OB Group, Department of Ryukyu Performing Arts, Prefectural University of Arts, introduced the role of each instrument in kumidori while playing sanshin, koto, taiko, kokyu and flute.
The host was Mr. Kawaman Kota from Miyakojima City, who was a member of the OB Association, and introduced the charm of kumidori.
In this workshop, I learned how five kinds of instruments are represented in dance by taking up "music" among the three components of kumidori (music, chant, Ryukyu dance).
As for the Sanshin, it was explained that it was an element of the movement and emotional expression of the characters along with the songs, and that Kokyu was pulling up the songs and the melody of the Sanshin while playing.
In the latter half, the students actually touched the instrument and felt its tone, and felt the charm of the instrument.
The purpose of this initiative is to get familiar with "Ryukyu classic music" through musical instruments, and to get interested in "gumi Odori" by many students, this is the first time in Miyako.

The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
It is the first edition of the Yahoo! News.
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The FIA announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship Japan Round will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Look back at past WRC World Rally Championship with images!
18 cards.
The last event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships under the jurisdiction of the FIA, alongside Formula One and World Endurance Championship.
Since 1973, it has become the world's highest rally championship with a history and tradition, and the competition is said to be the toughest car championship because it runs not only on closed roads (paved roads), but also on gravel roads and snow roads at high speeds.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title for the second season since 1999 and became a big topic.
This time, the Japan Round Invitation Preparation Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Corporation), the governor of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing WRT, said the following.
Mr. Hideaki Omura, Governor of Aichi Prefecture
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan in 2020, and we will work together with stakeholders to ensure that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in the fall of 2020.
Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the Japanese round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.It is the first global motor sports tournament for this prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you all here."
Mr. Shoo Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.)
"I am very happy to run Yaris WRC in Japan.
Thank you for your support."
In addition, many people, including Keiji Furuya, Chairman of the Association for Promotion of Motor Sports, commented on the Japan Round.
The WRC World Rally Championship will be held from 19 to 22 November 2020.
The area is a public road in Aichi Prefecture (Nagoya, Okazaki City, Toyota City, Shinjo City, Nagakute City and Shitara Town) and in Gifu Prefecture (Nakatsugawa City and Ena City).
The main venue is the "Love Earth Expo Memorial Park" which was opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exposition.
The Japan Round Invitation Preparatory Committee will hold a decision-making meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 test event will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is tasmaniadeville the key to cancer treatment?
Tasmanian devil may be the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could lead to major reforms in patient care.
Medical researchers have identified how some cancer cells camouflage.
Researchers have found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans.
It is expected that this discovery will create a new way to treat cancer patients.
What is the commonality between Tasmanian devils and humans?
It is an invisible cancer cell.
A team of researchers, including a researcher at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that cancers that do not respond to immunotherapy may significantly alter the treatment for cancer.
It may also be the key to addressing deadly facial tumors that threaten the future of Tasmanian devils on the verge of extinction.
The study found that some cancer cells in humans and bags use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camflage, causing markers to no longer react and the immune system to no longer attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
Peter McCallum researcher Mark Dawson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Traditional treatments may be reused to reactivate markers, or proteins known as MHC, and the immune system may be able to identify cancer cells.
"There is a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dawson said.
"Lung cancer is a disease prevalent in the world.
And it could be treated in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat face-to-face tumors in Tasmanian devils, where similar cases of cancer cells escape detection.
"Unsurprisingly, exactly the same process occurs in humans and Tasmanian devils," Professor Dawson said.
"It was very difficult to treat tumors in Tasmanian devils.
But if drugs that are effective in humans can be used in Tasmanian devils, they may be useful for controlling tumors."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting tiny stars.
Scientists have discovered the solar system, 30 light-years away from Earth, which overturns the current understanding of planetary formation, where giant Jupiter-shaped planets orbit around small stars called red dwarfs.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas giant GJ3512b orbiting its main star, the red dwarf was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
In this case, however, there is no big difference between the size of stars and planets.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% the size of the Sun, but the planet orbiting around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences, who led this research published in the journal Science, said.
The theoretical model of formation shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star," Morales added.
The planet, composed primarily of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Calalto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only much smaller than our Sun, it is almost the same size as the giant planet and only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the Sun, and the surface temperature is approximately 3800 degrees Celvin (6380 degrees C / C 3527 degrees C).
That's why I have a reddish color."
While there is a sign that the second planet is currently orbiting the star, the third planet may have been released from its stellar system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of its Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are produced from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gas and dust, which created the star that orbits itself.
In the most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core accumulation" model, objects emerge from solid particles in the disk, and the attraction created by the egg of the planet causes the surrounding gas to become the atmosphere.
A conflict model called a self-gravity instability model may explain this unusual planetary system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might have been slightly larger than expected and had lower temperatures," Morales said.
In this state, the disk becomes unstable, so some dense regions may emerge.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
a deli employee, a mame dip containing a stimulant, was charged with eating to his colleagues.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is accused of having his coworkers eat a dip of beans containing a stimulant.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Anni Medina Hernández (38) was accused of having taken methanephetamine transfer and regulatory drugs to others for Class B felonies.
The charges were caused by an incident at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to an estimate of the affidavit obtained from OregonLive.com, a suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Marion County Sheriff's deputy to taste it a bit because he saw Medina Hernández making beans dips.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane fetamine before, "After eating a few mouths, I thought it tasted strange, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach became sick and her legs became flat.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman went was judged to have contained methane fetamine in soy dip.
According to The Smoking Gunn, another Sliftway employee said Medina Hernández "was told" to the victim's food, while the third employee said the suspect had sent a message saying that he accidentally put methane fetamine into the bean dip.
According to an Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deli shows Medina Hernández pointing his back to the camera and clinginging behind the microwave, but taking something out of the brazier.
After that, he stood up and wiped his nose, walked toward the table and put a bean dip in a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brazier were also placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff, for now, did not think there were customers who had contaminated food.
Medina Hernández is held in Marion County jail instead of a bail of $5.2 million.
According to The Smoking Gunn, Medina Hernández's long-term arrest record includes assault, robbery, spoofing, the transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "The Challenge Can be organized" President of JR Tokai, attach importance to early construction | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
At a press conference on 27th, President Shin Kaneko of JR Tokai reiterated his stance on early construction, stating that "it is better to separate the issues that arise in consultation with Shizuoka Prefecture in the issue of reducing the flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the South Alps tunnel of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen, and that it is better to separate things that should be done before starting construction."
Specifically, he said, "We will talk at the meeting place and at the front stage."
President Kaneko said, "When we organize a lot of problems, it is difficult to start construction, and I think it is possible to divide them."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our thinking, we must talk to the prefecture."
The prefecture is concerned that the spring water from the tunnel construction cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he said, "If there is something that can be realistic, but I think it is difficult to think from the safety side of construction."
Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that the route change mentioned was "not possible."
President Kaneko pointed out three locations in Minami Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station and Nagoya Station as places that take a particularly long period of time for construction.

5 Medical Institutions in Saga Prefecture | Public Administration and Society|Saga Newspaper News|Saga Shimbun
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced the name of the hospital on June 26 that five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture needed to be reorganized and integrated.
Of the 13 medical institutions surveyed in the prefecture, 38 and 5% are the 10th highest in Japan, and three have already been integrated and relocated.
The hospital is named after the National Hospital Organization Higashi-Saga Hospital (Miyaki-cho, Miyoki-gun), Takyu Municipal Hospital (Takyu City), Kojo Municipal Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Imari City), and Tatara Hospital in Taramachi, Fujitsu County.
Of these, Takyu Municipal Hospital and Kojo Municipal Hospital are planning to build a new hospital in Higashi Takyu-cho, Takyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital has been relocated to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of community comprehensive care in the town, and has been operating in surplus for several years.
Mayor Takayuki Nagabuchi emphasized that "As a town, we have the idea to operate alone and cooperate with hospitals in neighboring cities, and hospitals must remain absolutely for the residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The administrative director of Higashi-Saga Hospital said, "We do not hear the contents from the prefecture," and concluded that "We will actively participate in the prefectural Regional Medical Design Coordination Conference and respond based on the purpose of the discussion."
The Organization for Promotion of Regional Medical Functions (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not a mechanical decision to determine the direction of public hospitals, but a request to consider again at the regional medical concept coordination meeting in each prefecture."
"We would like to hear from the parties about the future operation of the hospital.
In some cases, it may be necessary to review medical subjects and to further reduce the sickbed."

According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, only Queen and Prince Philip are frequent customers of royal aircraft.
During the "Royal Flight Secrets" program, the Queen's former flight attendants revealed that many of the hairy guests with the family ride frequently.
Bob Shields said, "Sometimes, like most important royal customers, there are also very important royal dogs."
The Queen's Coggy Dog Privileges are famous, and it is not surprising to request a cute pet to travel together.
Queen Elizabeth is said to have loved dogs since she was a child and had more than 30 coggy dogs when she became queen.
In 2007, she had five dogs, Monty, Emma, Linette, Willow and Holly.
In addition to these five, five Cockerspaniel bists, oxo, flash, pick, and spans, and four coggie mix dogs cider, berry vulcan and candy were added.
The staff on the Royal Aircraft will be busy.
The Royal staff were seen asking the dogs to leave the lawn before boarding, and Seals continued.
I have never been in an accident.
The show also found that her luggage during her public service trip was known for shocking amounts.
According to the Narrator, "There were 12 tons of Queen's luggage on a 44,000-mile British federal tour in 1953."
It can be understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
However, the queen does not like fashion.
The wife of the Marquis of Cambridge is also said to have a unique taste when carrying her own clothes, and she says that she takes one sheet for each dress.

In the first wave of Republicans in Deep South, Jack Edwards, a retired Alabama state senator who served ten terms as a federal legislator, died Friday.
Edward's family announced through his agent that he had died at Fairhope's home after suffering from pancreatic cancer.
While the Republican Party gained momentum in Deep South, many of Alabama's Republicans were elected federal legislators, Edwards was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1965 as one of its first wave.
Edwards served ten terms in Congress.
According to the announcement made by the bereaved family, Edwards recently asked what kind of world he would like to leave to his grandson's generation and replied that he would like to return to the liturgy.
According to his family, he said, "I want my grandchildren to grow in a country where they have regained thanks for their daily conversation and efforts to solve the problems of their homeland."
Governor Kay Ibii said Edwards served the state and state at the highest level.
He also said he plans to hold a half flag at the Alabama State Capitol.
"Mr. Edwards was a true public servant and the largest politician in Alabama.
My state lost one of the best politicians," Ibii said in a statement.

Michelle Obama, instagram, praised Megan Markle as "inspiration."
Michelle Obama appreciated Megan Markle on Thursday in a favorable Instagram, calling Duchess of Sussex "a thoughtful leader who breaks the mold and makes the world better."
Duchess and Prince Harry, along with his son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Winzer, attended a youth reception this week and met with executives from the Obama Foundation.
The former President made a very positive post saying, "Thank you, my friend, Duchess of Sussex, a thoughtful leader who breaks old customs and makes the world better."
Mrs. Obama published a photo of Mrs. Megan, who posed with the Foundation's executives, adding that "even in interviews with the Obama Foundation's executives, the support of girls around the world who seek appropriate education has inspired many people."
She served as guest editor in the September issue of Vogue magazine and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In his frank conversation, his former wife looked back on how mother and mother changed herself.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "Being a mother is like being in a senior class to let go."
My job as a mother was almost always to find myself that children want to be, and to leave a reasonable distance to grow.
To find out who they are, in essence, rather than the ideals of their parents or their childhood aspirations.
Mrs. Obama, who knows the pressure to be spotlighted in the world, advised Duchess little by little in the interview of Good Housekeeping.
sometimes you feel too much pressure from yourself and people around you.
So, my biggest advice is that there is no rush to do anything over time.

Trump Hotel owner complains about the suitability, but also holds a liquor license.
Washington (AP) - The Washington State Board of Alcohol and Beverage Auditors dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the local Trump International Hotel's license to sell alcoholic beverages because of questioning the suitability of the owner.
On Wednesday, three MPs, two former judges and two Jewish leaders complained that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the second attempt to revoke the hotel's alcohol right is based on a state law that requires the applicant's "suitability" to obtain a liquor license.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year cited Trump's assault charges and repeated fraud, claiming that he violated state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time that an appeal was made to update the permit.
The first harvest of honey collected by Bentley's "Flying Bees."
How is the taste of honey collected by Flying Bees bred at the foot of Flying B?
In May 2019, honey was harvested for the first time in September 2019.
More than 100 bottles of honey were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the site of a factory that assembles cars?
I want to taste this!
Click here for the honey produced by Bentley (11 sheets).
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we installed a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant at the beginning of this year.
The beekeepers watched the bees from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains collecting nectar from various flowers.
It turns out that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley is engaged in a wide range of activities through its Crew Plant and its operations to become the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers.
The staff are actively cooperating.
We are very pleased to receive the first harvest safely, and we plan to install more nest boxes next year to increase the yield of bentree honey.
Taking a small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to carry out various initiatives to fulfill our role."In May 2019, 1.2 million honeybees, Flying Bees, were launched.
In September of the same year, after a summer, the work of removing the nest frame from the nest box was completed, the nest frame was placed on a centrifugal separator, filtered the fallen honey, and then bottled.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like commitment.
The label was designed by Louise McCallum, the designer responsible for Bentley's interior.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to staff but also given to important customers and guests who visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
In addition to fennel tea that is compatible with honey, we also want to enjoy afternoon tea together with "Flying Bees" honey such as scones.
The Cleveland Police, a series of scandals, a report of fraud that is considered the worst in the United Kingdom
The police were accused of being the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud and were rated inappropriate in all areas.
According to Phil Gomley of the Cleveland Police Department, "a serious deterioration" continues.
In the past six years, five police chiefs have been replaced, and now they are facing a new demand for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect the socially vulnerable.
Phil Gomley of the Police Directorate said, "It has been a serious deterioration since our last investigation."
The Chief of Police Mike Wiel resigned in January less than a year before his inauguration, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was suspended after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Lieutenant Simon Herwood, last year, went to the Commission for the Investigation of Illegal Acts because he directed his colleagues to do sexual acts.
He resigned the police.
Conservative Mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Ministry of Home Affairs intervenes."
Police chief Richard Lewis said, "I have been improving, but I have full responsibility for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr became a "criminal," and impeachment has to be settled.
Nobody knows what will happen.
Currently, we believe we are involved in a cover-up case, which may take some time to investigate."
"I'm going to do a job that I'm starting to do based on the time it takes to discover facts and facts," Pelosi said.
In a White House record published this week, it was found that Trump asked Ukrainian President Vladimir Zerensky to investigate former U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
According to the call records, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his own personal advisor, Rudy Giuliani.
Trump denies fraud.
CNN reported Thursday that it was the national security attorney of the Ministry of Justice who first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine, more than a week before the formal inquiry.
The Ministry of Justice, charged as an inquiry by information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not cover the investigation of violations of political funds.
In response to Burr's question of what to testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Committee of Intelligence decides who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that he thought he was "criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from beginning to end," Pelosi said, and touched upon Trump's naming of the Attorney General for the July telephone talks with the Ukrainian president.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be forced to make a decision on the handling of this accusation.
Pelosi said he was "very concerned" about the whistleblower who was informed that Trump attacked the whistleblower as a spy on Thursday and hinted that the treatment of the spies was different in the past.
The President's statement is too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that whistleblowers play an important role in the disclosure and disclosure of fraud within the U.S. government, and that "the president did not say anything about the person who could have provided information to whistleblowers is a significant loss of the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi announced that he would formally impeach Trump on suspicions of putting pressure on foreign leaders for political gain and noted a historic step.
The call was included in a statement released on Thursday, in which the whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his authority to "quest for intervention" in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that White House advisors instructed officials to remove call records from cabinet-level computer systems and transfer them to special sensitive systems.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Bentek, driving ban by speed violation
Christian Bentek, the Premier League star who was cleared for two speed violations in two months, is likely to be banned from driving.
Crystal Palace's 28-year-old forward admitted on January 20, that he had driven his own Bentley, driving 50 miles per hour at the A3 speed limit in Richmond, southwest London.
The Belgians then shot a speed violation camera at Patney, south-west London, driving 89 miles per hour, more than 40 miles per hour.
Bentek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, does not have to attend the Court of Justice of the Security of Lavender Hill this morning.
In early July, Bentek was convicted of these two violations under a single trial procedure in which one of the magistrates tried and sentenced to light crimes.
9.2% of high school students in Taiwan "experienced" percentage increase that does not contraception = Health Authorities Survey (Central Focus Taiwan) - Yahoo! News
(Taipei 27) National Health Department of Sanitation and Welfare (Ministry of Health) announced the results of the survey on sexual intercourse experiences among high school students in Taiwan on September 26.
According to this, 9.2% of students answered that they had experience.
It was revealed that about one in five of them did not contraception.
The survey was conducted in 2017 for students enrolled in high schools, specialized high schools, and vocational schools.
Compared to the previous survey of 15 years, the percentage of students with sexual intercourse decreased slightly from the previous 11.1%.
On the other hand, 22.6% of men and women aged 15 to 17 answered that they did not contraception due to the latest sexual activity, exceeding 19.2% in the previous year.
The breakdown is 28.8% of males (22.6%) and 12.2% of females (14.5 percent).
The station pointed out that there are many opportunities for young people to get information on the Internet, and it is easy to bias their way of thinking by touching wrong information.
The lack of contraception calls for correct knowledge, not only for pregnancy but also for increased risk of infection.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu is concerned about the composition of the judging committee.
Cofi Manu, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasaccus, expressed concern about the composition of the judging committee for the upcoming Ghana Football Association (GFA) election.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davids, and expressed dissatisfaction with it.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu stated that the chairman had a stake in the results of the review process and that it was fair or doubtful to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside who is not affiliated with each member or has no prior interest.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote to Osay Kwak Parma about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, Manu argued that he had interests and that the commission of the review committee should not be allowed.
Mr. Manu stated that if Olympic director Fred Papoe attended the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to his association with the club.
The members of the committee were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4.
The Chairman is Frank Davis, a Corporate Governance Consultant, and the Chairman is Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Emmanuel Darkwer.
Other members include Reginald Laliair, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Akpocavi, sports director and lawyer.
According to a survey by the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered it appropriate to raise the minimum wage by 1,000 yen per hour.
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies applied for recruitment, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of appointments was around 50% for new graduates and mid-career regular employees, and only 30% for non-regular employees.
Many companies responded that they "approved" to raise the yen to 1,000 yen per hour, including information related (100 percent), construction (70.6%), and wholesale (61.7%).
The majority were manufacturing (51 and 9 percent) and service (60 and 9 percent) including food, drink and accommodation.
The representative of the conference said, "Although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with high part-time and hourly wages, there are many companies that think it is difficult to secure human resources and that it is likely to increase labor costs."
The average amount paid by companies who answered "the opposite" was 895 yen (from October 4, Fukui Prefecture was 829 yen).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 2007, 61.3% of regular employees hired new graduates, 54.5% employed mid-term, and 15.4% employed non-regular employees.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of scheduled graduates was 44.7%, 50.3%, and 31.1%.
In particular, transportation (37.5%) and construction (24.1%, 38.1%) struggled.
86.4% of the total number of applicants had challenges in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the number of applicants was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in the recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the second graduate (department within three years after graduation) and mid-career recruitment.
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's GDP growth strategy has already been approved.
Including 20 and 3% of "I intend to admit in the future," one-third of the total showed acceptance.
64.4% of companies were "not admitted," with construction (82.8%), retail (73.1%) and manufacturing (72.7%).
The survey was conducted from July 19 to August 2, targeting 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

Tiplic, the voice of the time before the battle with the Australians
Justin Tiplic said, "It's a show now," when Wales is heading for the World Cup Tennozan and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales wins Wallabeads, they will be the hottest candidate in Pool D, and will likely be the quarter final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, which has played 15 matches, wins 14 against Wales, Tiplic and the team will be the best eight straight line against England.
"It's a matter of course, both teams want to try and win at the top of the group and end," said Tiprick, a Welshman.
The fight against Australia had been tough, but it was good to win last fall.
I think Australia is quite blaming me to repay my debt, but I will try to win again.
Before coming here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And now I'm here, this is the real show.
Wales has won only one World Cup against Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Wales has won the third place since 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gutland, the Southern Hemisphere weight class 3 team achieved only seven victories in 41 races.
Wales finished 13th in the Test Match Australia match last November, but Tiprick was included in several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said, "It's hard to answer.
I'm sure the game was tough, maybe, but I don't know.
As a result, he scored about 15 points in the final game, so he seemed to be much closer to the score than actually."
The key to Wales' victory is the break-down battle between Australian duo Michael Hooper and David Pocock, who are worshiped as Buck Law.
Tiprick, who has played 67 international matches so far, has fought several matches and both players in the past, and knows exactly what is waiting for them.
"They are definitely world-class backs players," he says.
When I play against the background of the World Glass, I always know that I will be in a tough game.
They are always at the highest level in the world.
So I know exactly what kind of game it will be.
Pocock is one of the most defensive backs players in the world, and Michael is an aggressive backs, but it may be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense that he is going to the right place when necessary.
I want to improve myself by fighting the world's best players rather than confronting a very strong background.
I want to fight the best opponents, and if I play against them, I have to keep myself up.
This Sunday is not the final level, but it is an important match for us in the World Cup.
momentum is important.
If you continue to pile up a good performance, you will be able to play a game that won't lose.

Before the match, I was convinced that I would win, but as I got worse at the end of the game, I heard a loud voice similar to shouting "No."
When the game ended, the inside of the store was silent.

But will the relationship between the two begin or will you regret this hot moment?

If Yoshimoto Kogyo brings "90 percent of the gala," would it really be a gift from comedians?
A series of problems with Yoshimoto Kogyo triggered by the black sales of antisocial forces have also been solved.
At a press conference on July 22, President Akihiko Okamoto said, "The company has 9 talent at 9 and there is no such thing as 1," on average, "5:5-6:4," but the geisha protested.
If Yoshimoto brought 90% of the "9:1" ratio to Yoshimoto, it would be considered that there was a gift from comedians to Yoshimoto, and the investors' view that taxes would be on Twitter, and it was retweeted more than 30,000 times.
If Gyara's share is "9:1," will there be a gift tax?
i heard from you.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the tax standpoint.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to gift tax in the first place.
If the amount of work for 1 million yen is "9:1," Yoshimoto Kogyo will earn 1 million yen in sales and 1 million yen in expenses.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should declare your tax and already pay corporate tax.
Also, even if you are wondering about distribution, you do not claim that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount received is declared as sales.
The gift is said to be an act that firmly recognizes both sides of "I will give you a circle, I will receive it."If the performer who gave it does not recognize it, it will not be a gift even if the opponent is an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g., buying and selling real estate) at a price that is far from the original price for the purpose of tax avoidance, it is a problem in calculating taxes.
However, as in this case, a third party will not be able to decide on how much tax-appropriate prices are for those that both parties have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think it is a poison to pay for 1 yen.

the white house, a panic without a foothold of impeachment.
The White House officials were excited to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, explaining that this week's "great panic" was felt against the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the atmosphere of the West Wing seems to be increasing " Concerns, Anxieties, and Concerns" about the possibility that the appeal of whistleblowers could damage the President and some of the surrounding persons.
He said, "I don't really know what's happening."
The White House official joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, or that the usual measures that the President had made to deal with the matter so far could not be applied, so there was no confidence in how to proceed as this claim was so serious.
Another person familiar with the controversy described the atmosphere in the White House as "a state of great shock" as the President's unwavering response to the impeachment interrogation would increase the likelihood of being "incompetent."
Another source of information says that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised every day, and some of the close associates of the president are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump has spurred concerns over increasingly unpredictable actions and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means, and has been concerned about Presidents and Politics in an environment of election years.
Trump faced the greatest threat he had ever faced during his term of office, and reviving the strategy he judged to be effective during Robert Moller's Russian investigation, he became an attacker, a defender, and changed hands.
Trump attempted to deprive the Ukrainian president's request to cooperate in the investigation of political opponents, disinterested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for partisan conflict.
However, many White House officials have endured the Mora test, but this time they are beginning to feel the difference, the close advisers said.
The president, whose power is considered a brand, seemed to be attending a Wednesday press conference, said a person familiar with this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but did not seem to have been willing to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers are convinced that damage can be mitigated, arguing that it is a fact that it undermines the credibility of whistleblowers, as some are aware of the fact that they did not have direct information on the calls between President Trump, Vladimir Zerensky, and Ukrainian Presidents, which are controversial.
Furthermore, it often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of support increases to defend against such facts.
However, Republican strategists close to the White House point out that the president's basic support rate is already very high and that the impeachment will not have much effect on the acquisition of new supporters.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative agenda and monopolizes the news within 4 o'clock, "there is no advantage to focus on impeachment by the President for the next four months."
Another source stated that those claiming impeachment could help the president did not fully understand how uncertain the president's response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice from advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to an official who explained the plan's origins, this initiative is still in its early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the Strategic Decision Office will be implemented and how they will be implemented.
However, he said that there is a need for a clear leader who can aggressively organize public relations activities in order to counter organizational legal strategies, communication strategies, and the publication and publication of critical internal accusations against the momentum of Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munusin stated that they would not publish a note on Trump's call with the Ukrainian president 48 hours later, saying that the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible.
According to a person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called Trump's external pitbull and Corey Luwandowski, former head of the campaign headquarters.
However, Luwandowski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we've never talked to the president or his close associates about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Clow, is also involved in impeachment.
In an interview with NBC News, Clow said, "The problem is handled properly."
Emmett Frad, who was engaged in impeachment by Clinton and led the White House until the end of the Moller investigation, left the White House legal adviser Pat Sipolon with less experience and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience in impeachment.
More information on the White House's strategy, in general, noted that stakeholders are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but are aware of the need to be organized and capable of leading all-out response and political struggle.

Only 16% success rate Tomoyoshi Morikawa - Yahoo! News
9/6 (Fri) 13:51 delivery
I had a boyfriend all the time, but due to his work, I had a long distance love ....
I was told to marry someday, but I couldn't see the goal.
In such a situation, how can we connect the situation to marriage by side?
Editorial I of Nikkei doors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa to give a lecture on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice derived from detailed data analysis is mandatory.
what's this?
I am worried whether I should continue dating my boyfriend during long distance love.
I want to continue living in Kansai where I work and my parents live, but his place is Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is also possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, administrative office)
The couple who got married from long distance love is a minority.
Nikkei doors Editorial Department (--) C is in a distant relationship with her boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also the word "to be tested in distance and the two become stronger."
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) Speaking of distance love, a survey conducted by DeNA Travel (in August 2017, 1147 people answered) is famous, but according to the data, only 16% of couples from distance love to marriage are known.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by seeing the other person (visual), listening to the voice (heart), connecting the hand (touch sensation), smelling (olfactory sense), kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are many cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep up with hearing alone situations.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to your opponent's house, you will be burdened with time and effort to move to the transportation cost, and even though it is a holiday to heal the tiredness of your work, your body is a clutter.
I feel refreshed when I return home.
Is it necessary to break up when it comes to distance?
Morikawa If you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently, or a couple that has a certain period of time in advance, I think it will work.
I'll be engaged a year later, or I'll be back from work two years later.
It may be difficult if you do not see a future landing point.

Devin Nunes accused the Democrats of demanding Trump's nude pictures.
Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems to be reluctant to consider President Donald Trump being investigated.
On Thursday, in a comment defending the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain presidential nude photos.
Senator Nunes, a Republican executive at the House of Representatives Information Special Committee, filed a complaint at the beginning of the hearing about internal charges that Trump had requested to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
He accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the president's naked photographs, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left wing and its "media assets."
"The Democrats of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians to obtain Trump's nude photos."
It is natural for everyone to ask why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the President, that there is a chance within a year.
After Congressman Nunes' scolding ended, HuffPost's senior political reporter Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democrats were trying to find the truth.
Only Congressman Jim Heims of the Democratic Party of Connecticut has responded so far, but many other members are questioning whether the answer is red-naked truth.
MediAit.com speculates that Senator Nunes' nudist comments may be related to the "more unconfirmed details" that are said to have been written in the controversial steel document.
It is a notorious report that former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele collected a shocking claim against Trump, referring to a "stick tape" in a hotel room in Moscow where Trump is said to be watching prostitutes urinate, suggesting existence.
Origami, wallet and real cards.
Money Transfer, Loan, Insurance, Investment - Yahoo! News
In addition to paying by Origami Pay, Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to move deposits and withdrawals through remittances and cooperation with financial institutions' accounts.
There is also a charge function.
Together with partner companies, they will start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing can be used in Origami Wallet.
Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services, said, "We will create new financial services to solve the challenges of the younger generation who need to live with various problems related to money, such as pensions and low interest rates."
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have an Origami ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get timely information.
He also explained that by expanding the app not only on the Origami app but also on the app of partner companies, it will be a service available even if you do not have the Origami app.
Regarding loans, we introduce the functions that can be used to pay back in conjunction with settlement.
In addition, when funds were suddenly needed, it was completed on the Origami app from application to repayment.
As for insurance, he introduced Aioi Nissei Insurance and Dai-ichi Life as a partner company.
The two companies will use the data and knowledge of both companies to develop insurance products in line with life events.

New businesses for effective use of data
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business to support the effective use of data, including data held by companies, in addition to digitizing customer contacts through its own Pay through the payment function provided by Origami.
In partner companies that partner with Origami, such as payment and settlement functions, effective utilization of data such as structured data such as sales, acquisition of unstructured data in real society, accumulation, processing and analysis of such data will become a challenge.
Among them, Origami Technologies supports acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with payment data by its Pay and structured data held by affiliated companies.

Potential reduction of exhaust gas in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks and semis have monopolized the news, they are the only ones flying in the air that cannot reach renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta professor developed a technology to make renewable biofuels available as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Sciences, Alberta, launched the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil and fat from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality oil and fat to be used in production, while carbon emissions are 85% less than crude oil-based fuels, and waste from other industries can be used during production.
This technology also contributes to the reproduction of hydrocarbons in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "The first generation of this technology achieved (actually generated) is hydrocarbons of molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for biofuel use, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The jet fuel problem is like an irreplaceable dilemma," Bresler said.
It is not as valuable as diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as biofuel for jets.
The first is a low-risk approach that requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bresler said of the second option, "You can try it in the reactor to change the chemical reaction a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the US Army increasing investment in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future," he said.
I want to prepare the worst case alternative.
Currently, Foge operates a testing plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center, and recently invested $4 million from Lockheed Martin to help build a 25 million US production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant will produce approximately 1 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bressler argues that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate does not increase in fuel transport and production.
"As a technician," Bresler says.
My job is to create options so that you can make multiple choices in parallel with the decisions made after the explanation.

[High school entrance examination 2020] Hokkaido Public High School entrance examination and gender field of application are abolished (Lisemam) - Yahoo! News
The Hokkaido Board of Education announced on September 26, 2019, the selection of Hokkaido Prefectural High School students in fiscal 2020.

Boris Johnson's camp warns that if Brexit is over, the UK will face riots like Los Angeles Prime Minister calls for calm.
A senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the outcome of the first round, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
High officials in the prime minister's camp warned that Britain would face the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and civil riots on the scale of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson said he needed to "quench anger" against the political words exchanged in a fierce argument, but insisted that he would not use the word "defeat."
Despite the prime minister's appeal to regain calm, one minister told The Times: "In this country, there has never been anything like the Gilles Joan or the Los Angeles riots of 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a book called the Yellow Best Movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and then a few populists who use dirty hands to fuel people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when a jury sentenced four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King to acquittal.
This year, the French anti-government protesters wearing eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives, stating that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people vote in a referendum and 66% vote for those staying in the EU, 10 million people are dissatisfied," the Ministers said.
Even if 99 percent of voters oppose withdrawal, 100,000 very angry people will not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to go on the street.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum was to overturn the outcome of the first round, there would be a risk of "a violent riot by the people" in this country.
Johnson wants to hold a general election and entrust Brexit to voters.
Johnson has been reported to be facing a House of Representatives rebellion demanding lower demands on EU withdrawal and instead calling for a compromise to hit the EU.

The opening match of Niigata will be played at Away on Saturday, October 5.
pakistan, brother of social media celebrity, life imprisonment for honor murder.
The procedure is often prolonged and time-consuming to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed out and the memories of the incident fade, the female rights expert says.
"It takes too long to forget people," said the women's rights activist and founder of Pakistan's first gender department, Farzana Bali, adding that even the case of Barochi, which is attracting attention, took more than three years to resolve.
Human rights groups say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honorary murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the actual number of honor killings is much more than that, because it is estimated that Pakistan accounts for about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings of honor-based violence surveillance organizations worldwide every year.
1.3 billion yen countermeasures against pork cholera To add to the September correction plan in Shizuoka Prefecture (Asatsune Shimbun) - Yahoo!News

flood and chaos caused by prolonged monsoons in india
The monsoon season in India lasts for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and deaths, and many crops are beginning to rot.
Monsoons in northern India usually weaken their forces in early September, but the average rainfall in this month is usually 37% higher.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues for a few days, the monsoon will weaken at the latest decades.
Many parts of India still have unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in Pune, western India, heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays destroyed buildings and killed several people.
The houses are flooded, and the inhabitants walk through the streets with water on their knees, usually seen only at the height of the monsoon season.
Other cities such as Kolkata, Raknau and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rains.
In northern Uttarakhand, heavy rains caused significant damage to houses.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
With water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for possible droughts.
Long-lasting monsoons are not desirable for farmers.
This rainfall is not uncommon at this time.
Prakash Meherah, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarakhand, said, "We are currently making cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes, but the vegetables will rot in the rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak monsoons.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees (23 pence) of onions are usually sold at 80 rupees per kilogram.
The festival is also in danger.
The next big festival is on October 8 in Dashela, where the Hindus set up a giant comic book-style doll, Ravana, the evil smiling figure of the beard-boo appearing in the epic "Lamarana."
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if the monsoon pulls long, the last laugh may be Lavana.
[Sendai] Defeat Yokohama M with a Compact Defense Director Watanabe, Response by Private Practice (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo!News
J1 Begarta Sendai conducted private practice for 24 to 4 consecutive days (open to the press only 20 minutes at the beginning) for the 28th Battle of Yokohama M (at 7:00 p.m.).
Yokohama M lost 15 points in the last three games of the league, but Shin Watanabe (45) responded by saying, "The players showed me powerful, battle-like exercises."
Last season, he lost 8 games in the clubworths at home on July 18 and lost 5 in the enemy territory.
It is a difficult enemy to lose in 1-2 this season.
Yokohama M ranks third for Sendai, which currently ranks 14th.
In addition to strong front-line players such as the 13-point FW Marcos Juniol (26), 10-point 7-assisted FW Nakakawa Teruto (27), Japan National Team DFB Makinosuke Hatanaka (24) and the Brazilian DF Chiago Multins (24), J's leading CB duo are also waiting.
Director Watanabe said, "There is plenty of aggressive play in and out, there is also a speed CB, I want to protect compact and fight with confidence without seeing the tear."
The Emperor's Cup, which aimed to win the first championship, was defeated by J2 Nagasaki on the 18th, and only the remaining eight league matches were played.
The commander said, "It was a regrettable loss, and it is the most important thing to stand up from there."
It enhances feelings and shows the results of the measures on the pitch.

Exposure to large amounts of pesticides and increased risk of heart disease and heart attack
Current studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides may lead to higher risk of heart disease.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent compared to men who did not work around pesticides.
"This research highlights the importance of wearing personal protective gear when exposed to pesticides at work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure at work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the research.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of the Department of Elderly Care at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu who participated in the Kakini Honolulu Heart Program.
The research focuses only on Japanese-American males, so it may not be applied to women or other races.
Due to the long half-life of pesticides, health effects may appear years after exposure.
The study had the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of follow-up research, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and heart attack at work is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said in a press release.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to aging and hiding the possible relationship between pesticides and heart disease in his later years.
Researchers have found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides has no significant relevance to heart disease or heart attack.
Poloshenko intervention at the Zerensky Trump telephone meeting
The impeachment procedure for U.S. President Donald Trump was a dramatic week on Washington political issues.
For political novice Vladimir Zerensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals.
However, what has been known to date on the Zellensky-Trump telephone issue, and is there a widespread impact on Zelensky?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had more convenience in Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not literal, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing more on the specific proposal.
Zerensky's response to Trump's 1000% argument is controversial.
Zerensky added that both President Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko posted on Twitter that "there is no previous support from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for support, including EU sanctions and economic aid, during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Voytica, said: "Can we negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Trump then mocks military aid and asks Zerensky to investigate two rather than one, one against the son of Joe Biden Hunter, and the other on the server of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting Ukraine was involved in the Democratic e-mail incursion during the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would hinder European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to talk about anyone.
Thanks to the announcement of the call records, I would like to thank those who support me."
Zelensky will meet with Russian, German and French leaders at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.
Ghana won two awards at the International Civil Aviation Organization
Ghana won two prestigious awards at the 40th ICAO General Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The award was awarded for Ghana's provisional implementation rate of 89.89% and the highest score in Africa for air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed its coordinated verification survey (ICVM) on April 3, 2019 in accordance with the United Nations Air Force's World Safety Audit Report.
The safety award is a result of the recognition that Ghana complies with the standards and agreements recommended by ICAO on safety at airports and national airspace.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's delayed National Zero Campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications for safety evaluation and 17 certifications for safety evaluation were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was given to Joseph Kofi Ada, Minister of Aviation of Ghana, Simon Alati, Director General of Civil Aviation of Ghana, Nii Icoi Otou, Ambassador of Ghana to Canada, and Yau Kuwakwa, Director of Ghana Airport Company.
In his speech, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmiwa Bennard Aliou stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in the participating countries.
"It is important to continue to be aware that aviation safety, security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in this era of innovation."
Mr. Ada said that this award complements the indomitable efforts and perseverance of the sector and is a gift of Ghanaian efforts.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a tremendous potential to develop the domestic economy, as "air is likely to change our lives dramatically."
There are social and economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

Trump and Peter Gianno are appointed as FEMA Chiefs: White House
On April 3, 2019, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency deputy Peter Gino smiled on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA Budget Claims Tribunal at the National Security Senate Committee in Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gino as Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday.
Mr. Gino, Deputy Director of FEMA, was in the position of deputy director of government disaster response, such as hurricanes and wildfires.
The office had been vacant since March when former Secretary of State Block Long resigned.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, the upper body of FEMA, decided that Mr. Long had illegally used government-owned vehicles to commute between Washington and his home, Norcarorina, and he resigned.
Another recommended candidate, Jeffrey Baird, was suspected of being drunk and involved in a riot, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of the month after consideration.
Mr. Gino's appointment as Secretary was as expected.
In the future, the majority of the Senate will need approval.
Prior to joining FEMA in 2018, the White House stated that he was on duty at the Emergency Management Department in Rhode Island and had naval soldiers.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (CBSLA) - Police shut down illegal marijuana Beiping activities in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant on suspicion of selling illegal marijuana pen-shaped beeps, care began at 4:37 p.m., and a large container of Butanhanie Oil (enriched cannabis oil) was found in an office building located at 9600 blocks on Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said the investigators also found equipment to pack the beep cartridge.
"This process is very dangerous," Kano said.
He had previously been involved in narcotics investigations and stated that there was a possibility of a fire in the process of extracting oil used in the beep product.
"It is possible that static electricity from clothing alone can be ignited, and since it is concentrated, it causes not only fire but also explosions," says Kano.
In addition, if there were multiple containers like this, the entire building could be blown away as well as a fire one after another.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office to seize illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
The investigators said they received some anonymous information, which led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still pursuing who is the black curtain of illegal Beip activities.
The police said that because the office was empty, Zhang himself believed that he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continued, the police stated that they would like to receive recent news, especially regarding the dangers of bating, and prevent illegal bating products from appearing again.
"I don't know if it's real or what they're buying."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great deal of harm to our community and children, so police are constantly warning people not to approach these activities.
In the middle of the concert, there was a big earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6!
Evacuation training at the Miyazaki City Hall - Yahoo!
Based on the assumption that an earthquake occurred during the concert, a practical evacuation drill was conducted at the hall in Miyazaki City.
This training is held every year.
On the stage, a performance by the Miyazaki City Fire Department is actually performed, and an earthquake with a seismic intensity of 6 is expected to occur during the song.
About 300 people including kindergarten children, local residents and hall staff participated in the training on the 27th.

Exhibited at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was made of the finest Camlet silk, woven with silver foil yarn, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Elery Lynn, the dress collection curator at the Historic Royal Palace, is determined to be one.
This faded piece of cloth, hung on the wall of a small church in one rural area, is said to have been placed there 100 years ago, and seems to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lynn accidentally found this luxurious cloth, which was used as an altarpiece for the church in Baxton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at Hampton Court Palace near exactly the room that the Tudor Queen might have worn over 450 years ago.
Only one of the remaining 16th-century dresses is known to have been an important discovery throughout the Royal Dress Collection.
Although there is no perfect proof that Elizabeth passed the sleeves to the dress, three years of research has increased the confidence of experts that the dress is not part of the royal possession.
The exquisitely expensive textile "silver silk cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but it also suggests that the quality of plants and flowers embroidered, as well as the patterns of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears that were added later were noble people.
It is believed that the dress was equivalent to a Tudor mansion when it was built.
In addition, in the late Elizabethan 1590s, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or could not tolerate rivalries wearing such luxury clothing.
Mr. Lin said that it is important to publish it, so he came to see his colleagues.
Everyone was really happy to see the cloth and say, "It's amazing," and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of a piece of dress that was cut and used as an altarpiece of the St. Faith Church in Baxton is not as expected.
Baxton is a village from Blanche Parry, who served as a court lady throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life, and a local legend says that the cloth has long been associated with Parry.
Although the dress dates back to 1590, experts believe it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Parry before Elizabeth died in 1603.
Over 1000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles were spent on very delicate hand-sewing, the altarpiece will be displayed next to the portrait of Elizabeth wearing a similar dress, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The large enough space to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only in a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, where most of the preservation work is done and led by Libby Thompson, who said, "If you're dealing with historical fabrics, you'll feel really respect for the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered surface and back, you will find a great respect for the person who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
A week after "the scope of the request has been searched" female child missing The Self-Defense Force withdraws Volunteer men are also missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first-year elementary school girl disappeared at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew on the 28th.
The search for Kokura Misaki, the first grader of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, disappeared and the search for the 28th day began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village requested the Self-Defense Forces to withdraw from the area they requested, and the search for the Self-Defense Forces ended at noon.
From 25 days to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed a total of 650 people, mainly in areas with high risk, such as mountain slopes and saws.
Also, on the 27th, the whereabouts of 20-year-old men who volunteered to participate in the search were lost, and they searched together, but they have not been found.
The police and fire department will continue to search from 6:30 am on the 29th.
1st Oral Speech - Yahoo!News
The first oral argument of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election.
As a result of the appeal, the plaintiffs sued for invalidation of the election because the value of the vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared with Fukui Prefecture, which has the lowest number of voters per member in the House of Representatives in July.
In the first oral argument held at the Miyazaki branch of the Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that the value of one vote was unequal and unconstitutional.
On the other hand, the prefectural election management committee on the defendant's side requested a rejection of the claim, saying, "It should not be said that the issue of unconstitutionality was in a significant inequalities, but should be constitutional."
The judgment will be passed on October 30.

Arriving at Space Station, Unmanned Supply Vehicle Catching with Robot Arm | Shizuoka Shimbun
"Konotori" No. 8, an unmanned supply vehicle that arrived at the International Space Station.
The robot arm of the station is growing from the bottom left (NASA provided).
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught Konotori No. 8 and applauded JAXA officials on July 28.
On the night of the 28th, the unmanned replenishment machine Konotori 8 (JAXA) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), which carries supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), which is about 400 kilometers altitude, arrived near the station.
The spacecraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by controlling JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, flying at the same speed as the station eliminates the difference in speed and approaches to a distance of about 10 meters.
The robot arm is 17 and 6 meters long and grabs the supply machine.
It has about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
After attaching it to the station, the airmen carry the luggage.
he was involved in one third of the mexican drug cartels
Shortly after sunrise on the Chicago West Side, CBS News caught rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the daytime.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of overdose.
McNnight said that "probably 90%" of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king Nemecio Cervantes, commonly known as El Mencho.
Matthew Donahew DEA, executive officer in Mexico, said, "Mencho is a DEA and, indeed, a top-prior of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $10 million.
With the help of Donahew, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were exposed.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisco Nueva Henneración (CJNG), is involved in at least a third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel has sold "massive" cocaine, methane fetamine, and phentanyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's head is awarded a $10 million prize.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels there.
It has a large number of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
Donahew said he actually owns his own special mobile unit.
From the death of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions this summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by drug cartels.
According to Mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
In Chicago, the confiscated Mexican drug is toxic and must be used in protective clothing when handled.
At the manufacturing base, the bag of cocaine is stamped on the smuggler.
More than a third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahew said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively capture the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child died, Donahew said it was "probably" a drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of Koalasha, where eucalyptus grows.
He is 12 years old.
Coala's breeding life spans 15 to 20 years, and it is thought that he will complete tenju in the UK where he is married.
Mr. Hideki Tsujimoto (40), the keeper in charge, cried, "It is hard to put the curtain on the breeding of koala, and it is full of gratitude."
Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news released PS4 games in the old days
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition The Last of As Part 2.
As part of the recent state of play announcement, Sony announced the release date of its sequel, Last of As, February 2020.
Some of the video games of this new action game were also shown to fans.
More details have been published a few days after the Last of As2 announcement.
Sony and Noty Dog seem to return to the old style in many ways.
The last-of-a-part 2 that has not been seen since PSwan's time has been released on multiple discs.
In a great telegraph interview, Nortedog's Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous one, the story is magnificent and complicated," Drackman said.
And it was necessary to make it bigger to tell a story with many characters like this.
I didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but it eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolded, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game was so spectacular that it did not enter a single Blu-ray that it contained two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 contains one or two Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that do not open at work.
I don't want to ruin this surprise, but the Easter Eggs in the game contain some nostalgic Noty Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 exclusively for PS4, you will see more.
Those with PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered in PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019.
MLB The Show 19 will also be released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like the Last of As Remastered and want to book a sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie's backpack and bracelet replica, and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notojima Mobile Sales "Save" Council Trial Residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notojima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to the aging of the population, the Notojima Regional Development Council (Notoshima Regional Development Council) was established by residents.
During the trial until December, wagons loaded with daily necessities, seasonings and food crossed the Somachi-kai and Hanpo-machi-kai on the first day.
There were also products that were quickly supplemented with sales that were more than expected, and residents said that it was fun to choose goods.
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
In order to be able to eat even the elderly who live alone, the total vegetables such as potato salad and kinpiragobo, which are divided into packs, were lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Somachi-kai, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akinobu Kikuchi of the council said, "I didn't think it would sell so much."
Mr. Mitsue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with her husband's driving, said, "The price is cheap and convenient, I do not know when my father can drive, and I hope he will continue."
The user also ordered "not canned coffee, but also coffee that drips on their own."
The council will consider the requested items.
On Noto Island, there is currently only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to buy and sell goods to save "shopping weak."
Until December, the 20 town councils on the island will be held once a month, and we will consider whether they can continue as business after next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that he had decided to provide approximately $100 million additional assistance to drought-stricken residents.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by drought have been extended, and existing farm allowances have been revised significantly to simplify.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be allocated to the drought-affected residents' support organization, and the target farmers will receive up to $3,000 emergency assistance.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to 100 million dollars of drought relief money to develop infrastructure and prevent drought damage.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already budgeted over $7 billion for drought assistance.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing Stephen, Katie Stay, and four of his five children.
Haskell said on July 9, 2014, he was pushed into the house of Stay and asked for the whereabouts of his wife Melanie Haskell.
Melanie was absent but had a family with her sister, Katie Stay.
Haskell fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Stephen Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), thirteen and four-year-old son, and nine and seven-year-old daughter were killed.
Only one member of the family, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived.
At the time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but he recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed Ronald Lee Haskell's innocence.
The jury was dismissed until Monday's trial.
"If we choose to disappoint us, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook her anger resonated with the leaders of each country.
Global warming is increasing.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tunberg delivered a speech seeking to strengthen measures.
He boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread "school strikes" around the world.
Young people, who raised anxiety and anxiety, protested all over the world, including Japan.
It is estimated that about 4 million people attended in more than 150 countries.
He also marched in Morioka with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will be launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the latter half of this century, and to reduce the temperature rise before the Industrial Revolution by less than two degrees, if possible, to one or five degrees.
All participating countries shall take measures that are determined by each country without distinction between developed and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is pointed out to be related to global warming.
In order to achieve global warming at a fast pace, one step of efforts is required.
At the summit achieved by the call of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to intensify the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal of virtually zero by 50 years.
The other 70 countries decided to raise their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not explicitly stated new targets, and the movement of the emission powers has become conspicuous.
Japan's strong criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy is to set zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but there is a great gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who demonstrated Japan's efforts at environmental-related meetings, said at a conference on climate change, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of the girls.
There is no opposition to Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The uncontroversial scars are nothing more than the "replacement of issues" that the person himself refutes.
There is no longer a grace to cope with global warming, and the international community must respond to the common crisis of humanity in a timely manner.
We can't expect the effectiveness of each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act without taking the future away.
one step further to realize quantum internet
The research results of the U.S. Army led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such an Internet may be able to provide military security, measurement and timekeeping functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the Army Research Institute's Distributed Quantum Information Center of the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Department, funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University have achieved a record of quantum entanglement transport between matter and light - a distance of 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are entangled and measured in one, even if the other quantum bits are physically far away, the measurement results in the other are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is twice as large as the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building intercity quantum networks," says Ben Lañon, an experimental physicist and project leader at Insbruck University, who announced the results in Nature's quantum information.
The intercity quantum network can be said to consist of a network between physical quantum bits in an entangled state despite the large distances.
The dispersion of this entanglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of quantum internet.
"This proof is a big step towards realizing large-scale distributed entanglement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
The enthanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and at the same time excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and they are immediately absorbed by optical fiber cables," says Lañon.
First, the light particles were sent through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to the optimal value of long-distance transport - 1550 nanometers, which is the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a 50-kilometer optical fiber cable.
In the measurement results, atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-distance transfer of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms is because calcium can be captured simultaneously with high-quality "clock" quantum bits, which leads to the realization of entangled networks in long-range atomic clocks.
The large-scale enthangler clock network is a very important field for the Army in terms of accurate position measurement, navigation, and time-keeping applications."
