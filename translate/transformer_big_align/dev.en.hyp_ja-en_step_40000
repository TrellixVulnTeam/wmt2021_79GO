Croatia's nuclear treatment facility plan, Bosnians protest
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the town of northwestern Bosnia and protested the plan of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant near the river known as beautiful nature near the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The protesters gathered in the city of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly requested Croatia to abandon the plan to store the site of the garrison of the Turkovska Gola.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant in Kussko.
The Bosnian people said that the nuclear waste treatment facility could threaten the lives of approximately 250,000 people living around the Una River and its surrounding areas.
We must oppose.
The head of the Novigrad municipality, Miros Love Rodrika, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and rivers.
It was founded in the 1980s and is owned by Croatia.
The two governments will open a consultation next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
On Friday, the Croatian state broadcast reported that Croatia should build its own storage facility, or that Slovenia should pay for the amount of waste of Croatia, which is processed in the newly constructed facility.
Minister of Environmental Protection of Croatia, Minister of the Environment and Energy of Croatia, said that Croatia has a problem with public waste processing from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find full solutions.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents of the country claimed that Croatia would search for another construction site near the nuclear power plant.
Why would the Bosnian pants pocket in all Croatia be the best place?

Pope Francis, AI development, based on public interests, warned IT companies.
Pope Francis warned IT companies, diplomats, investors, and so on that there would be fears that artificial intelligence development competition and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope stated in the Vatican Conference where the government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met in one hall.
In this conference, a number of scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in the discussion of future and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions on the future of war development and increased machinery work were held at the same time, and a case verification of the gunfire incident in the New Zealand Church and the response of social media companies at the time of the violent video spill.
In his speech at the meeting, Pope praised the development of technological advancements, citing how machines were released from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if it was too much to rely on robot engineering to pursue profit, there was a fear of taking the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances are more and more prominent, it is not true progress," Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, we will be able to reverse the state of a kind of barbaric based on the theory of strong people.
According to the conference organizers, I would like to take advantage of the expertise of the participants at this conference to find people who can be a future advisor to the Catholic Church on high-tech areas.

This lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, which was accused of the former president of the Bank of the same bank and the former staff of the 70 joint union banks.
When the lawsuit was contacted, the name of Sharad Powerle was not anywhere.
On Thursday, Anna Hazale asked questions about the lawsuits and rumors that Sharad Powerr was involved in the fraud incident, saying, "Who did the name of Sharad appear?"
Anna Hazale, criticizing Sharad Powerle, expressed the expectation that the Executive Bureau would be able to identify the truth if detailed investigation into the fraud case.
A veteran of many corruption prevention activities, Anna Hazale said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."

Step off the accelerator pedal!
Four out-of-the-counterfeiting equipment - Yahoo! News
it's surprising that you can buy a reasonable price.
Traffic accidents caused by driving errors.
Among them, the accident caused by the failure of the brake and accelerator by older drivers is increasing.
In particular, when you move forward, you can become a panic and the accelerator is on the side of the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with a safety support feature that covers such a driving error, but there is also a rearing device that can be mounted on unmounted vehicles.
These later parts manufacturers have developed and sold rapid prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what features they have.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrower at the same time.
[e-ACEL ALRM] To inform the mistake of pedaling from a new perspective, the "e-ACEL ALRM" developed by Pibot was developed.
The pedal's step mistake is to avoid using the alarm sound.
The mechanism occurs when the brake is stopped or slow, and the accelerator pedal needs more than necessary.
To avoid rapid acceleration by reacting to sound and encouraging the accelerator to return quickly.
It is also effective for elderly drivers that are difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the error of the accelerator.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the body is attached to both tapes.
The price is about 9800 yen (tax included) and the amount of light that you need to set is attractive.
The World Wing launched its launch in mid-September, but it is said that the accelerator brake step is a fault prevention device.
It is also possible to retreat without advance.
At the stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedals were rapid, the vehicle's vehicle's speed signal and brake signals were detected and the accelerator is electrically suppressed.
When you accidentally step through the accelerator pedal, you don't tell the signal from the accelerator, and quickly control the rapid progress in order to remove the brake in the D range.
At the time of the retreat (back) there are also features that detect the speed of about 5Km/h and force the vehicle to switch to the cleaner state.
The mounting can only be done with a capon and simple wiring processing.
The unit price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

Mr. Kawazaki said, "I don't understand that the weather has changed before, and the last time it was okay."I want to take care of the connection between small ideas and people and prepare for disaster."
The representative of Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions were made to communicate to the government as a group."
Contact the police officer with Boris Johnson and the women's businessman Jennifer Currii.
The Police Agency (IOPC) examines whether the President of London should examine the President of Johnson as a violation of criminal code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that the director of GLA recorded the matter of action by the Prime Minister regarding the alleged suspicion that the Prime Minister had been given preferential measures by the Prime Minister.
"The matter of action" exists when there is information that indicates the possibility of a crime."
This is not a proof.
IOPC will consider whether to investigate this issue.
The problem was given to IOPC, but IOPC is an organization that responds to charges issued by the police in England and Wales.
The problem was that Johnson was in charge of the police officer's office at that time.
Johnson denied fraud related to the relationship between Mr. Arculi.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information about the relationship between Mr. Arqueli.
It was reported by the Sunday Times, but the press reported that Johnson had paid 126,000 pounds of money from the public during the London mayor's reign, and was given a special measure to participate in the foreign trade-related dispatchers.
Since then, the government frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to the company and hackers house in the survey.
The company will ask questions about the investigation process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
In the House of Representatives, Mr. Matt Waman said that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office, which is said to have been located at the site of the Archici clan (34).
The relationship between Prime Minister and women was "the secret between the staff."
The movement of GLA, who tried to take care of the Prime Minister, was touched by the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
The government officials said that this was an attack based on political motives, and the timing of the previous night of the Conservative Party was "very party."
"There was no evidence for any charges, and the prime minister was given the opportunity to answer the director's office before the announcement of the press on the late Friday night."
The public and the media will also take a look at the political Kyogen that was organized by the people.
As I mentioned earlier, the standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and the California businessman was "the secret of the public."
The former staff of London and Partners (L&P) said that despite those who had thought that the company was "accreditable" at that time, he had a privilege to accompany the foreign trade-related talks led by the Mayor Johnson.

"It's time for us to support companies that are needed in the world," I feel that we have been able to understand the message that we have stated in the past.
As a result, it is the reason why it became a long-term fund for 20 years and it has continued to be a direct sales system to deliver messages directly to many people.
At the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
Generally speaking, information about what you're buying now is black box, but all the funds have been disclosed.

the former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, the suspect in the investigation of bribes.
According to the court documents submitted on Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to be false to the Federal agent who conducted the corruption investigation of major political donors.
In the list of federal courts' lawsuits, Robin Hayes was convicted on Wednesday.
According to the fact that Hayes was prepared as part of the judicial transaction and signed by a lawyer, Hayes was aware of the fact that he had written a false statement to the FBI investigators in 2018.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed and the documents based on facts are not specified to indicate which sin is written.
Hayes was initially accused of conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
The prosecutors accused him of being involved in the plan of the heavy insurance company, who had been involved in the plan of raising funds to the state insurance director for special treatment.
The two co-founders and co-owners of Greg Lindberg were accused of attempting to bribe the Secretary of Health, Mike Corsey.
Lindberg, founder of insurance and investment companies, has donated more than $500 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported Republican principles and politicians, but was also offered to the Democratic Party.
There was no reply to Lindberg's lawyer on Friday and E-mail.
On Friday, the defendants of Hayes asked Carnes Davis to add additional comments via email.
The court documents submitted to Friday were described as false statements by the FBI agent in August 2018.
However, according to the fact-based documents, Hayes actually talked about the personnel transfer requests in the insurance department from the state insurance director and Lindberg.
The prosecutor said that Hayes helped the request of Lindberg, who would like to meet with Corge, and also talked about direct bribes with the director.
In April, the prosecution announced that Lindberg would seek special treatment for his insurance business, and he was planning to take over $200 million to re-election in 2020.
According to the prosecution, the conspiracy involved a request for a replacement of the authorities who had reviewed the company in Lindberg.

In a conversation involving Lindberg and Corsey, the co-founder of Lindberg instructed Hayes to transfer $25 million to the reelection campaign.
According to the prosecution, Hayes was initially accused of taking care of the expensive money, but the conversation ended.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes said, "What do you want?"
i understand.
There was no response to the Federal Prosecutor's Office to ask for more information about judicial transactions by email.
It's a good idea to improve the happiness of Facebook and users!
In the world's first attempt to raise the sense of happiness of users, some users would like to post others soon!
This change followed the similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, and it's good!
The new attempt on Facebook began on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager, Amgerrick, said this change is based on the feedback of mental health experts who consider the number of social comparisons.
Garric said, "There was a very positive feedback from many bully groups and mental health groups in collaboration."
It is only to remove numbers that allow users to focus on quality of exchange and content, rather than the number of actions.
Garric said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform rather than feel competition.
Garric refused to receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed Facebook.
It is time to say that instagram tests such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland and other countries have been tested.
Instagram, under Facebook, has not been announced when this test ends.
"There was also a positive feedback about experience in Instagram, but now it is a stage of listening to feedback and learning."
Garric, in Australia in the world's training countries, pointed out that Australia has a very active "technic" Facebook and instagram users.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback about whether this is a valuable experience for people.

I helped them in such a way, but it was a part of the art of Cando.
when i gave up
His mother's broken bag is the ultimate pchipra.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair the repair, the price of the body was significantly exceeded.
My mother said, "I don't want to give up."
First of all, I was looking forward to the home center and looking for what was changed to this consolidated gear.
However, even if there are rings, there are only silver colors.
Gold did not look at it.
I went to Candu and finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it in the hands-on corner.
As expected, there are 100 levels and everything.
It was originally used for key holders and craft DIY.
Each bag handle is scheduled to be used one by one side.
Although the size of the ring is small, the left side of the bag fittings are lined with the same shape ...
This opened the way to repair bag.
It is attached.
what?!
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is strong to pull outside.
I installed it on my bag.
The color of the gold system is good!However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor ...
So I tried to make a two-sided ring.
Because of its lightweight parts, there is no problem with weight.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts of the Kirakira has increased and the design level has been improved.

Pakistan's social media star, Candy Baulch's honorable murder, his brother's life imprisonment.
Mr. Candy Barrowchi, who was famous for photos posted on social media, was killed in July 2016.
Pakistan's popular social media, the brother of Cumberland, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday, and was sentenced to imprisonment with a "religible murder" that attracted the most attention of his father's state Pakistan.
In July 2016, Mr. Barrowchi, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, was killed in July 2016.
He was arrested by his older brother Muhamad Eagle.
After a few days in the press conference, his brother said that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and did not regret what he did.
AFP, a lawyer of the clan, said that the court of the Eastern city Muletan was convicted of the defendants of the eagle and sentenced to life imprisonment.
He said, "Inshaler (God's thoughts) will be innocent at the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, his mother Annwald Mai told AFP that his son wanted to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Barrowchi's murder became a major news worldwide, and as a light view of the law of his father's rights society, most of the victims were killed and most of the women were forced to act against the spread of the so-called "primary murder."
In the case of Mr. Barroch, women chose to marry themselves, and in the case of Mr. Barroch praised their sexuality, they were burned in crime, such as shameful of their families, killing guns and hanging.
The murder is usually performed by close relatives.
After that, the perpetrators of Pakistan can be forgiven from the relatives of the victim.
After three months of murder, the Congress passed a new bill that would require a life sentence to honor the murder.
However, the possibility that the murder is an honorable crime is in the discretion of the judge, and the killer may claim another motive in theory and be forgiven.
In the case of Mr. Barroch, the parents initially claimed that their parents would not be forgiven for their son.
However, when I lose my son, my parents changed their thoughts and asked him to forgive my son.
In response to international hatred against the murder, the Pakistani government made an unprecedented means to declare the country as a successor, but the lawsuit continued.
The famous action of Mr. Barroch offered to show a strip show at the Pakistan Cricket Team, and on Valentine's Day, she wore a bright red dress.
It became a critical and threat, but it was recognized by many people, including young people, who opened new heaven and earth in a country where it was considered to be a bold and political activity to express themselves as a presence like Kim Kadanian.
The roots of the murders are ethnic and social norms, and are now widely left in South Asia, especially in women's actions.

A huge amount of knowledge and the latest knowledge is the " brain science theory."
Then we will send you a piece.
In the previous section (see related article), Motoko is a traditional "man's fantasy" and the pattern learning is overwhelmingly lacking!
Later, I talked about how to become a cool man and become a man.
i'm going to live with you.
In the previous section, I talked about the need to learn patterns everyday by looking at various works and people's behavior.
When learning patterns, I think that the brain will be able to live in a rack because it is better to do so.
I think I'm still evolving every day as my own "mote."
That's why we live.
When I was teaching at Tokyo Tech and the Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked to many young people and learned many patterns of interaction with them.
However, if you are in the position of a professor at the university, you might be a little bit spicy.
I don't care about it every day.
After all, I'm going to live by saying, "What should I do?"
However, even if I don't change it, society will change.
I've talked about it in my recent talk book "No matter how bad the world lives."
It's natural that people around the world recognize their people and recognize them.
I don't think it's light.
It's hard to get around.

In the northwest of Nigeria, the number of refugees doubled: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the announcement of the United Nations on Friday, the number of refugees from the northwestern part of Nigeria doubled by about 40,000.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization, the "new humanitarian crisis" has been created by this confusion, and each institution will work together with the end of the year, with a new 3550 million funding activity.
The UNHCR report states that the Islamic extremists who have been active in anti-government in the northern part of Nigeria over 10 years have been unrelated to several recent armed attacks.
Rather, violence in the state of Sokot in Nigeria for the last 10 months was organized by organized armed groups.
"The fear of illegal states and unstable situations," said Barok press officials on Friday and Friday.
The kidnappers, torture, assaults, murders and sexual violence often occurred, and the raiders were working to destroy their homes and the press officials said.
The military and police are also sent to confront the crime organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with the western African branch of the Islamic State, which was split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugee does not come with the name of the group."
What they're doing is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees go to Niger next to the country.
In the statement, UNHCR announced that the security situation in Socot has worsened, and that refugees across the Niger will increase in the next few months.

Sonet Media Networks (hereinafter referred to as SMN) was offered (hereinafter referred to as "Prebid.js") in LFP.
LFP provides services to purchase and planning their own advertising frame according to the request of advertisers.
The Services will provide effective advertising frames via DSP through collaboration with media companies.
In order to achieve a fair bid competition with multiple viders (adverted companies), the system is able to deliver high-cost advertising to media operated by the media.
For media companies, it is becoming increasingly transparent, and it is expected to improve profitability.
Until now, SSP has been offered to the advertising frame.
In recent years, from advertisers, "I want to deliver to a specific advertising frame with a high affinity with individual goods and brand images," the LFP was launched in December last year by collaboration with the medium company to directly purchase the advertising frame that was attached to the request of advertisers.
This time, the introduction of the LFP will be expanded due to the response to header binding.
The benefit of advertisers is that they can participate in a bid for direct header-by-sided advertising frames, thereby increasing the opportunity for advertising.
As the media is limited, the advertising frame is secured along with individual retail and brand images and prevents brand value damage.
The benefits of media companies are said to be a solution to the implementation of media companies by integrating LFP's code, called "Rapper Solution," which is called "Lapper Solution."

The rebellion of the cabinet requires the Bols Johnson to reduce the demands of the EU withdrawal and to compromise with the EU.
It was only three weeks after the EU summit to be settled, and now the concern that the Prime Minister would take a significant amount of concessions is growing around the prime minister.
Bols Johnson is facing the rebellion of the cabinet that seeks to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and to make a compromise with the EU.
The negotiations on a new tariff system to replace the return stop clauses related to the border of Ireland, and the EU considers the alternatives of the Johnson clan as "operable."
The senior ministers are expected to propose a compromise on the ground floor by the Conservative Party leader of the EU, led by the German Prime Minister Anton Merkel.
The San paper heard about three ministers who were facing the Prime Minister after the Conservatives' annual meeting in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the "gravity" strategy that threatens the EU, which was invented by the senior advisor Dominique Camingz, to accept the offer that the EU will limit time.
One Ministers said that the ruling that the Supreme Court was illegal on Tuesday was "the police bell," and that the compromise was the only way we could withdraw from October 31.
They are opposed to us in the House of Representatives.
The Prime Minister must use what can be used more than a step.
It is not effective even in extremes, and the plan of the cachings is obviously unsuccessful.
We cannot fight in many areas.
Another cabinet, however, promised to talk to Johnson to run the agreement with Prime Minister Terry.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I would like to talk to Boris to return to the House of Representatives."
As a result, everyone is trying to end this.
If there is no delay, Boles will end and we will end.
John Mayer accused Boris not to think of negotiations seriously.
The former leader of the Conservative Party said, "The Prime Minister wants to connect the EU to the agreement.
However, we do not look at the fact that the Prime Minister will establish an agreement with the EU.
Instead, we saw that the Prime Minister, in Scotland, examines the eggs in the Ulez, discuss the nationals and discussions with the people on the big street.
The Prime Minister said yesterday that the agreement is still far ahead, "If anyone does not think differently, the way is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben bill, which forced to postpone a three-month delay, would significantly weaken the position of our negotiations in Brussels.
The press said, "It is no doubt that this bill is hindering the position of our negotiations, but the Prime Minister and colleagues are trying to work hard and continue forward despite the establishment of the bill."
Minister Stephen Barclay, the European Union withdrawal minister, returned to Brussels today for further consultations with Michel Barnier of the EU.
They discuss how the regulation zone of all islands on food and livestock is functioning.
Loren Kelly: The Glasgow accent was said to be absolutely successful in the television world.
Loren Kelly was said to be the boss of the television station that he would never succeed as a host of the Glasgow accents.
For the first time in the television screen, Kelly, 59-year-old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I'm still 25 years old and very nervous."
I was working as a researcher at the BBC Scottish Branch and said that the boss's boss did not succeed in the absolute television industry.
Before his departure at the Glasgow office, he went to London to meet everyone of the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that Anne Diamond and Mike Morris had interviewed the legendary actress Benty Davis.
I didn't believe in the same room as a living legend.
I found that I was here.
Kelly began working as a local newspaper reporter in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and in 1984 he became a journalist of TV-am Scottish Branch.
In addition, Kelly served as a host of programs for GMTV and ITV's Breck Fasts and Day Breaks, and then began to show her name.
To celebrate the 35th anniversary, Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews were broadcast.
"The passion and enthusiasm" and " curiosity" were the secret to survival in the television industry, and the host said, "I have to do it."
It must be honest and honest.
I am interested in many people and interested in them.
Looking back on the news that was shocked in my mind, Kelly revealed that it was "very painful."
On the following day, a terrible incident occurred that 16 students and teachers were killed, and many of the wounded children were killed or injured.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, who was five-year-old daughter Jo Anna, told me personally, so we talked about hours at her home.
I went to Jona's funeral and Pam and I've been friends since.
In addition, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry Maccan's daughter Made Rain was missing in 2007, but said it was "very hard" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the wife."
The couple must endure the net as if they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter.
The couple really don't poison.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine was broadcast on 8:30 on Monday, September 30.
gwenga, afraid of traps in Zimbabwe
According to the government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined due to anxiety that President Robert Mugabe's offer from President Robert Mugabe might be a trap that could lead the military action in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the defense forces continued to be held, and Mugabe offered the presidency to Chiwenga, and the last week the Zimbabwean Independent paper was reported.
However, the reason that Chiwenga refused to offer is because of anxiety, it is the cause that he saw the intention of the Mugabe to use Chiwenga to know the leaders of the world and the African Union on behalf of the African Union.
According to a series of Twitter reports that the authorities confirmed that the government was a senior in the Cabinet Office of the Cabinet Office, Mugabe, who had been holding the government for 37 years, was willing to give the administration to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Muanguwa.
Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, told the government officials to contact Chiwenga by the messenger.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was conducted by three.
He and his senior officials were involved in negotiations with the President George Charanba of the Central Intelligence Organization at the time, Aaron Nepela and Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonoli, who were the first representative of the Central Intelligence Organization.
Gideon Gono, former president of the Zimbabwean Reserve Bank, was the one commissioned by Mugabe, who was entrusted to the position of President to the commander of the Zimbabwean Defence Force.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, attempted to condemn the African Union's military action while seeking intervention by leaders in Africa.
The offer to transfer the president's position to former CDF was not due to the selection of former presidents.
"Some of the former president's family began to suffer fatigue, and it was an act of abandonment to save the rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, at least the political goal of the late President was to change the flow alone.
If you want to destroy the Constitution, you would have to collide with the views of the African Union on the coup, but you would like to remember that the commander had not defeated the Constitution order and declared that it would not be broken.
The President of Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top of the military at that time, would be trapping the claims of commanders who claimed to have not defeated the constitutional order.
President Mugabe wanted the African Union to decide whether the situation should be considered a coup without fully grasping the whole situation, but eventually it was considered a valid case for military interventions.
It was intended and calculated on the root of this offer.
When he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces, Mugabe moved, and the authorities speak.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi in the military, and Mugabe was unable to write his resignation.
The commanders of the army told Mugabe that even if they were invaded by the president's residence, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe wanted to protect his family and prove the power of the military.
The commanders and commanders at that time read exactly the intention.
In the words sent by the ambassador (gono) who told the hard speech of the president, "Is Tiri Bekławpa Macwapa (which we belong to the military division), we were used as a powerful metaphoric expression that "we are not in the political competition unless a politician."
The Army said that through the military commanders in the region, the purpose of the military was to remove the "criminals" surrounding him, not to defeat Mugabe.
In addition, Mugabe attempted to return to South Africa with the same method to discuss the coup and successors.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
As the president of the South African Development Community at the time was the chairman of the South African Development Community in South Africa, the key South Africans refused to intervene in the process, however, it was clear that the South African Army would immediately be sent to Harare when the Army invaded the House of President.
"Just because it was not supported by the President Putin and the leaders of Africa, it was not possible to realize it."
The ratification of the treaty in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
【New York Joint】 On the 26th of the United Nations Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at the world without nuclear weapons was held, and Mr. Takeuchi (63) of the Second World War, the grandson of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) at the time of the atomic bombing.
The new five countries ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratified it in 32 countries.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
The meeting and ratification took place in accordance with the International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons on the 26th of the UN.
The Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs also expressed strong concern in recent years as a move to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"I don't want to eliminate it."
China needs a strong leadership force, and if it doesn't matter, the collapse of policy documents
China required the Communist Party to have strong and unified leadership, and stated in the policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
According to the Chinese National Bureau of Public Affairs, the Chinese government reported that the Communist Party took over the administration of 70 years ago, and the success of the party was due to the leadership of the party.
China is wide, and the domestic situation is complex, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified strong leadership, China would go to split and collapse and become a disaster for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long been justified to address problems in a robust manner, as it is necessary for national stability.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, who is the leader of the second-largest economic power memorial ceremony, has held the government in late 2012.
He also directed the modernization program of the military that threatens the region.
China does not intend to export the model of its own development model, and it is said that it is only a policy document that will not only be able to incorporate the models of other countries, but also seek peace alone.
Among the Chinese genes, there is no other country's invasion or world control.
In modern times, China was bullied from the column, and the war and confusion left deep scars with its pain; China would never be able to bear the pain he experienced by others.
China's strong trade war with the United States faces a difficult issue, such as economic downturn and anti-government movement in Hong Kong, China.
It is said that China will never abandon nuclear profit and will not tolerate security and sovereignty.
"There is no need to solve any problem with the threat of trade war," says White Paper in relation to trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with the momentum of the complete industrial system, complete industrial chain, wide market space and strong economic development.
"It will never weaken the trade war."
It is convinced that China has a power to open a new world by changing the crisis to a chance.
Since China has no idea to counter the US and does not want to replace the U.S., the US should calmly capture the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely to stop the development of China.
If you want to suppress and suppress other countries, and move to the country's contradictions, the US will not maintain strength.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from the director of Hirata and the director of Kimko, and it was revealed (Sports News) - Yahoo!
The name of the high school baseball, Yokohama Taka, who has won five national championships in spring and summer, announced on 28th that he was dismissed from the same date as the director (36).
In the future, he was appointed as a director of Takayama Highlight Coach, and the manager (responsible teacher) decided promptly.
Director Hirata and director Kimko reported that the local paper was on 26 October that the baseball team had been involved.
When the school heard the situation from two people, Hirata's director took over the head of the student, and Kimko's manager admitted some of the rumors.
In addition, as a result of the study of hearings from 66 students, he again confirmed the facts of two people, and was dismissed on 28th.
In the summer of 1515, Mr. Watanabe, who was raised by Shosuke MATSUSAKA (present-day) and raised the lead, won the battle.
He was a director and director of the Board of Directors.
In the summer of 1603, he participated in the Kokoen Garden for three consecutive years.
However, in the summer of this year, he was defeated by the Sagamihara of the prefecture in the semi-finals, and in the fall, he was defeated by the Kirinami Gakuen in the semi-finals and the next spring Senbatsu was despaired.
They don't want to talk about diets in their families after they're suffering from separatism.
Melannie Chizom, a spice girl, admitted that he had banned the diet at home because of his experience of a struggle for eating nothing except fruit and vegetables for many years.
The sporty spices have been diagnosed with depression and diet disorder after a long period of time, despite the pressure of members of the global pop group.
Chizom told her that his experience was influenced by her daughter's children's children's children's children, stating that "every topic about diet is prohibited in families."
"Skerlet is now 10 years old, and I'm going to take care of her own appearance."
However, since I experienced a diet disorder, I was very careful when I talked with my daughter.
A positive word, now it is customs.
In the 1990s, he gained fame as a member of the Spit Girls, and in the early 1990s, Mer told the story of Women's Health in the magazine, that he still led to his "thick" comment on the media.
"I don't care about myself, and I became more aware of the specific food groups and more exercised, and it was too thin."
He was very ill and his condition lasted a few years."
The Court of Justice: How about the Hokkaido Shimbun?
In a lawsuit against whether the marriage was established in accordance with the marriage, Saneoka Branch of the Utsunomiya City Court approved this.
More than 20 countries acknowledge that marriage is more than 20 countries, and there is no legal effect in the country, such as Sapporo City, there is a system to authenticate partnerships.
As a result of this, the two women were given the status of marriage.
It is considered the first judicial decision to have legal protection for couples.
The lawsuits for damages to the country due to the provisions of the civil law and the provisions of the family register law are conducted in five jurisdictions including Sapporo.
In order to overcome the judgment, I would like to deepen the understanding of the rights of sexual minorities and discuss the ways of the legal system to recognize various families.
Females lived in the United States for about seven years and obtained a marriage certificate in the United States, but the plaintiff sought compensation for the former partner.
The ruling was recognized as "the reality of marriage between men and women" due to the performance of two living beings.
It is a revolutionary decision to expand the certification of marriage with the rights to marriage in social insurance.
More importantly, the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution, which is only based on the agreement between marriage and marriage.
The two sides said, "Because the marriage was not expected at the time of the establishment, the purpose of denying marriage is not solved."
Even though the Constitution does not consider marriage, it is expected that the government will not be able to complain about whether it is prohibited or not, it is expected to be the driving force of the same marriage lawsuits throughout the country.
On the other hand, despite the fact that the marriage was not accepted, the question was that "the benefit of legal protection between men and women was different."
While recognizing the same situation as between men and women, the right to protect is different.
In the study of national home trends for married women, there are about 70% of people who have considered marriage to be legal.
While diversifying lifestyle, the law is tied to traditional family statues, and it will take the right of people who cannot afford it.
Due to the fact that marriage is not a " spouse" that recognizes the law, there are still few constraints, such as lack of tax exemptions and lack of co-author rights.
In the study of marriage, it is necessary to review family laws from various viewpoints, including the expansion of legal rights of marriage, not only between marriages.
the trial of the former athletes accused of rape of multiple women, and the jury trial.
Several women have been prosecuted for sexual assault on the former Delaware University baseball player.
On Friday, after 10 days of testimony and valve theory, the jury began to review the life of Craig Conaway 23.

After three weeks of the encounter, Konaway sent his own nude photo to women.
Conaway was asked for sexual assault against six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecutors claimed that the woman resisted when the conaway attempted to assault the woman by escalation.
The defense said that women had regretted the contradictions and memory differences between women.

One of the four times he was welcomed by the lead, and on the left side, the liner was now on the 20th lap.

List of new sports on September 27
it's a serious pollution of popular tourist spots, and obviously video
Among the tourist resources of Sydney, which will bring $2 billion to Australia's economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest producer of opera house, surfer key, Luna Park and famous Herbert Bridge.
However, under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
The famous port of Sydney is one of the worst waterways in Australia that flow around 15 cups of contaminants every year.
Thanks to this statistics, one of our biggest attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title from Sydney Harbor, the waterway around the most popular city in Australia is flowing into the waterways around the most popular city of Australia, with many shoes, clothes, and even animal dead bodies - everything flows into Sydney Harbor by rainwater flowing through the road.
Among them, the biggest factor in removing waterways is plastic.
Dr. Catherine DaForon, Vice President of the Sydney Harbour Research Program on September 27th of World Tourism, said "This is a paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most modified and contaminated mouths of Japan.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour can flow into the waterway, most of which flow into Sydney Harbor via rainwater drainage.
"There was a lot of heavy rain, but after that, Sydney Harbor was quite a tragic."
Two-thirds of the pollution flow from the rainwater flowing through the road.
However, it is like a part of the iceberg, and there are more serious problems: 70 percent of plastics flowing into the ocean are deposited in the seabed.
"I really don't know what's wrong with the sea level, but I don't know what's wrong with it," said Dib Center Manley, owner Richard Nicols, who collected about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year.
If you're more aware of a lot of people under the water, I think everyone really is.
It's overwhelming, but the whole thing we discover is more than half a plastic bag.
The remaining half is used for plastics somewhere.
At first glance, Sydney Harbour is beautiful and it is impossible to anyone who has all plastics and wastes on the bottom of the water.
Gerlemy Brown, one of the founders of the Ocean Protecht, said that it could be possible for local residents to reduce plastics and wastes in the waterways.
he should start from the source of the occurrence.
To reduce the use of plastics, to recycle more well, and eventually flow into the sea, we must be more conscious about what is flowing into the water.
About 50 percent of oxygen that we breathe will come from the ocean to kill ourselves.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is the source of food.
But we repair Sydney Harbor and return to the old appearance, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing humans.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also announced in this month, as part of the activities that the Australian public would be able to know about environmental protection and the reduction of the effects of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new survey, about 546 children from 12 to 18 years old, 82 percent of them have despair about plastic waste and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste problems are adults.
In this study, the problem of plastic waste was ranked fourth in concern for parents, and the study of 551 and 93 percent of the parents in the middle of the survey felt increasingly anxious about the amount of plastic waste in the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, and that led to ecopathy.

At the end of his efforts, he was told to be a announcer of the television station, and when he was so hurt, his father said, "I didn't think it would be a conet."

In this discovery, new methods for cancer patients are born.
What is common with Tasmanian deville and humans?
It is a cancer cell that cannot be seen.
The team, including a researcher at the Peter Mac column Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there is a cancer that does not react to immunotherapy, it could significantly change the treatment of the cancer.
It is possible that the key to working on a highly deadly face tumor that threatens the future of the Tasmanian deville near extinction.
In this study, some cancer cells in humans and bags were not reacted by markers to use a series of proteins called PRC2, and the immune system could not attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called a small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Merkel cells.
Dr. Mark Doson, a researcher of Peter McCarts, said, "This project is very important for patients who have shown resistance to immunotherapy, that we might be able to reverse the process."
You can reuse traditional treatments and activate proteins known as MHC again, and the immune system can identify cancer cells.
Dr. Doson said, "It might have a considerable impact on patients with lung cancer."
"The lung cancer is an infectious disease in the world.
And there may be much better way to treat.
Researchers expect that this discovery will eventually be used to treat the face-side tumor of the Tasmanian Deville, which is happening in cases where cancer cells escape detection.
"It's surprising that the same process will occur at the same time (to the Guns of Human and Tasmanian).
"It was very hard to treat the tumor of the Tasmanian Deville.
However, if the drugs that are effective for humans can be used in the Tasmanian Deville, it may be useful to control the tumor."
scientists are also confused with giant planets orbiting the polar stars.
Scientists discover the solar system that covers the current understanding of the formation of planets, which orbits a giant Jupiter-type planet around a small star called a red dwarf, to a distance of 30 light from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, a large gas planet GJ3512b was released around the red dwarf star.
The stars are usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, there is no difference in the size of stars and planets, and researchers told Thursday.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"That's another surprise," said Juan Carlos Molales, an astronomical physicist at the Catalan Space Institute at the Institute of Science, Spain.
The theoretical formation model shows that usually low mass stars are the main stars of small planets, similar to Earth and small sea lions.
In this case, a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter was discovered around a very small star."
The planet, mainly composed of gases like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Spanish Coloral Alto Observatory.
The planet takes about 204 days by drawing an elliptical orbit around the star.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
GJ3512 is not only very small than our Sun, but also the same size as the giant planet, which is about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the energy of the release is smaller, the surface temperature is much lower than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 ( degrees Celsius).
So it's a red color."
On the other hand, while the second planet is now orbiting the stars, the third planet may have been released from its star system in the past and the explanation of the elliptical orbit of Jupiter-type planets was explained.
Planets are generated from the same disk consisting of stars and dust produced by themselves.
In the most powerful planetary formation model known as the core integrated model, the object is generated from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes the atmosphere by pulling the eggs of the planet.
This unusual planetary system can be explained by using a conflict model called self- gravity instability model.
"In this case, the primitive planetary disk around the star that was born might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature was low."
Because disks are unstable in this state, some dense areas may appear.
These masses may grow until the collapse, forming planets.
i'm going to take care of my colleagues to eat the beansdipps with a delicate employee and aspiration agent.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassara Medina Hernandes (38) is accused of eating a dip of beans with a stimulant.
On Thursday, Allbani's Kasandra Animina Hernandes (38) was accused of taking the transfer of methane fetamin and regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident occurred on 9 September at the Suffway grocery store in Jefferson County.
According to the estimate of the statement obtained from Oregon Live.com, the suspect's colleague (27) asked me to take care of the lunch and asked me to see Medina Hernandes made a beansyp, and he told the sheriff of Marion County.
According to the statement, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane phantomamine before, "I thought it would be a strange taste, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, the stomach was poor and the legs fell.
According to Albane Demokrat Heathard, it was judged that women were involved in methane phantamine in local hospitals where women had done.
According to The Smoking Gun, another liftway employee told me that Medina Hernandes had told the victim's food to put the drug into the victim's food, while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message that methane fetamine was accidentally put into beans.
According to the Oregon Live article, it is said that the surveillance video captured by the delicates is a picture of something out of the brager that Medina Hernandes is behind the microwave oven for the back of the camera.
After that, it is said that he wipes his nose and put the beans into a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon State University Journal, the sheriff said that there are no customers who have been contaminated food now.
Medina Hernandes was imprisoned in Marion County, Pennsylvania, instead of $52 million.
According to The Smoking Gun, a long-term arrest record of Medina Hernandes has a history of heavy crime, including assault, robbery, transfer of methane fetamin, theft, and possession of methane fetamin, and possession of control weapons.

Michele Obama, instagram, gave me the inspiration and praise.
Michele Obama praised Magan Markle on Thursday, favorable instagram, and called the wife of the Duke of Sasex to break the type and make the world better.
During his 10-day visit to South Africa with his son Arche Harrison Mountbatten-Winzer, Prince Harry met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
The former president said, "I think the old custom is better than the world, my friend, Princess Sasex, thank you very much."
Obama's wife wrote a photo of Mrs. Magan, who poses with the Foundation's executives, adding that "Even with the Obama Foundation's executives, the support of girls around the world who seek appropriate education is stimulated."
His former "suit" actress, Magan, served as a guest editor in the September issue of the British Vogue magazine, and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In a direct conversation, former president's wife noted how his mother and mother changed himself.
In the interview, Mrs. Obama said, "It's like being a mother and a senior class to go."
I learned that most of my work is to find myself that children want to grow and take a suitable distance to grow.
It is not the ideal for children as parents and the desire of their children, but in essence they find themselves.
Obama's wife, who actually knows the pressure on spot lights in the world, was an interview of Good Housekeeping magazine, and advised her little bit to the duke.
Sometimes, there is a lot of pressure from people around themselves and around them.
So it's my biggest advice to me that I don't have any time to do anything.
In the first few months in the White House, instead of starting to work ambitiously, the girls began to live in a well-being school, and they were attracted to new friends.
Nevertheless, I think it's better.

Trump Hotel owner's complaint, and the license for sale of liquor is retained.
Washington (AP) - The Court of Justice of the State of Washington, Washington, dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the permission of the local Trump International Hotel.
The Committee on Wednesdays, three senators, two former judges, two Jewish leaders, and most of the petitioners had no fixed assets in Washington, Washington or the state.
According to the Washington Post, the appeal of the cancellation of the right to provide alcohol at the same hotel based on the state law which requires the applicant's "goodness."
In the first appeal submitted in the summer of last year, he repeatedly accused President Trump's assault and violated the state law.
The appeal was rejected because the permission certificate was already accepted.
In response to the renewal of the permit, the second appeal was issued.
The honey bees collected by the honeybee "FairBees" of Bent tray are harvested first!
How about the taste of the bees collected by the FlyingBees, who are buried in the knee of the FlyingB.
In May 2019, a regular bee was started on the site of the British Bent tray's crew factory, and the first honey was harvested in September of the same year.
More than 100 bottles of honeybees were collected from only two nest boxes.
In the factory site where the car was assembled, why did Benttt have started to be adopted?
I want to see it!
It's here that we're working with Benting.
Peter Bosh, director of the Benting Manufacturing Division, commented as follows.
"The aim of contributing to the conservation of biodiversity in the region was to establish a nest for the first time on the vast grounds of the crew factory.
From the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains, the honeybees have been gathering various flowers.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeepers, and it is wonderful that there is so much harvest in the first year.
Bentling is a part of the breeding of honeybees, through the crew factories and our business, as much as possible as the top of the scalable luxury car manufacturers.
We actively cooperate with the staff.
It is hard to get the first harvest safely, and next year we set more nests and plan to increase the amount of harvests of betellers.
A small step will lead to conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives in order to play our own role."In May 2019, 12 million honeybees "FlashBees" were started.
In September of the same year, the work of removing the nest from the nest box was completed, and the nests were filtered into the distant body, and after the drop-down honeys were filtered.
You can also see the bottle and package of honey.
The design of the label was directed by the designer Louise Mac column, who is responsible for the interior of the tray.
The bottled honeys are not only attached to the staff but also gifts to customers and customers who visit the crew factory.

It is said that the United Kingdom's worst report on the Cleveland Police and the fraud report continued.
The police continued to be arrested by the police, and the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported that it was inappropriate in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continued to "a serious deterioration," and the police director Phil Gomley said.
In six years, the police officers were replaced by five police officers, and now they are faced with voices seeking new demolition.
According to the report, the crime was stopped and the suspect was arrested and the efforts to protect the vulnerable people.
Phil Gomley, the police director, said, "We have been serious since we finally investigated it."
Mike Vill, head of the police station, resigned in less than a year of his appointment, but had been investigated for his own actions, but was not published.
The deputy director Adrian Roberts was arrested after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, who was in charge of sexual acts last year, went to the illegal investigation committee for the reason that he worked for his colleagues.
He resigned from the police.

Nancy Peroci: William Bar needs to be a "criminal" and to conclude an impeachment.
No one knows what's going on.
At present, we have been involved in the incident that has been covered by cover-up and may take some time to investigate."
"I'm going to do my work based on the time to find facts and facts."
In the records of the White House published in this week, Trump asked the president of Warrodi Mill Zerensky in Ukraine to ask the Vice President Joe Biden and his son's investigation.
According to a call record, Trump also asked Mr. Bar to cooperate with his personal adviser Lucy Juliaini.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN first noticed the internal accusations against Trump's actions involving Ukraine over a week prior to a formal inquiry, and reported on Thursday.
The Ministry of Justice, who was accused of inquiries from information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone meeting would not be involved in the investigation of political funds.
In response to the question that the bar should be testifying, Peroci stated on Friday that the intelligence special committee would determine who witnesses.
However, Peroci added that Bar would have become a criminal.
Certainly, the bar was quite before.
"It was the name of the bar at the end," said Peroci, who touched the name of the Secretary of Justice on the telephone meeting with the President of Ukraine.
It's interesting that Barr would be able to make decisions on the investigation of this accusation.
Mr. Peroci said, "I am very concerned about the internal accusations that he became a source of information, that Trump attacked the accusations on Thursday, and that he had been treated differently in the past.
I think the president's statement is too irresponsible and dangerous.
Peroci said that the internal accusations have played an important role in the disclosure of fraud in the U.S. government and the release of the public, and that the President said that it was a terrible thing about those who could provide information to the internal accusations."
Mr. Peroci, on Tuesday, announced that Trump's official condemnation was made to the foreign leaders for political benefit.
The call was included in the charges issued on Thursday, and the internal accusations claimed that Trump was abused by the job rights to seek intervention in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The internal accused also claimed that the White House's advisers were instructed to remove the call from the cabinet-class computer system and to replace the system for special sensitive information.

Ghana: Mr. Cofi Manuel, and the Committee on Reviews
He has expressed concern about the composition of the next Ghana Football Association (GFA).
He questioned the question of being included by Frank Davis, and expressed dissatisfaction with him.
In the interview with GNA Sport, Mr. Manuel stated that the chairman has interests in the results of the review process and that it is fair to include the president.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair, neutral member from the outside without prior interests.
For example, Davis signed a contract with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as the Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, he argued that he was interested in him, so that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
When Mr. Manuel attended the Committee of the Olympic Committee, he suggested that he would be biased and unfair if he attended the Committee on the side of the chairman's relationship with the club.
The members of the committee were scheduled to start activities yesterday after the ceremony held at the GFAAkra Secretariat on September 19.
Mr. Frank Davis, a corporate governance consultant, was a member of the lawyer Marian Barano and Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Regald Lariair, a marketing and sales officer, and a lawyer Richard Apocavi.

In order to increase the number of applicants, the total 86 percent of the total number of participants had a challenge in hiring, and in many cases, "The company's reputation is low."
As a measure to address the government in the recruitment activities, there were many voices asking for the enhancement of the introduction function and information for mid-term adoption within three years after graduation.
There were also opinions about providing PR opportunities to students outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
On the other hand, 15 and 3% of the countries proposed in the growth strategy are already recognized.

before the battle with typrick
"I'm going to show you now," said Justin Tipprick, in the event of the World Cup Ten King of Wales, Australia's victory.
If Wales won the Wala beads, it would be the most hot winner of the pool D and probably the semifinals against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia has won the 14th victory against Wales, Tiprick and the team will be the best line for England.
"Of course, I want to challenge both teams and end up winning at the top of the group."
Until now, the fight against Australia was a tough result, but it was good to win in the autumn of last year.
Australia thinks it's quite a shame to return the loan, but it's until it's hard to win again.
Before I came here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I came here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales won only one win in the previous World Cup against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and won the victory for Wala beads 32 years ago.
Under Wallen Gattland's supervision, all three teams in the Southern Hemisphere have a total score of 41.
Wales stopped the last November test match against Australia, but Tiprick included several representative members of the game 9-6 and one of the players playing at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
He said, "It's hard to answer."
Certainly it was a game, and maybe I thought that everyone would win, but I don't know well.
As a result, I had about 15 points in the final game, so I seemed to have been more than a score."
In order to win Wales, a combination of Australia, who is worshiped as Back Lo, Michael Hoper and David Poke, and a breakdown battle with Tiprick.
Over the past, Tiprick has experienced 67 international matches and has been fighting for several matches and players in the past and knows what to wait.
"They're definitely a world-level backpacker."
I always know that when I fight backrows of the World Glass, I'm always going to be a tough match.
They are always the world's highest level.
So I know what kind of game will be.
Pocock is one of the world's leading players in the defensive battle, but it may be said that Michael is one of the best players in the world.
I want to increase myself with the world's best players.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against them, then you have to do it well.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's important for us to play in the World Cup.
The momentum is important.
If you continue to build a good performance, then you can play without losing your momentum.

Do you regret this hot moment?
Although the column helped Ben and the Boby Beer (Cry Milner Russell) also helped the two people slowly, the column was very happy to see Ben's weakness and gentleness.

If Yoshimoto's business takes 90 percent of Gala's work, would you like to give a gift from the performers?
A series of issues of Yoshimoto's business, which led to the dark business of antisocial forces, were closed.
At the meeting of July 22, President Akihiko Okamoto said, "It's not true that the company's talent is 9 and that's not like that."
If the ratio of "9:1" is about 90 percent, the view of investors who have been given a donation to Yoshimoto from performers and paid taxes is flowed on Twitter.
If Galla's withdrawal was "9:1," then would it cost a donation tax?
He was also a member of the Minister of Tax.
In the first place, the company is not subject to the donation tax.
In any case, we will answer the tax position.
Since Yoshimoto's business is not an individual, it is not the subject of donation tax.
If you're working for 100 million yen, Yoshimoto's business will benefit from ¥100 million in sales and ¥90 million in expenses.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, we have already paid a corporate tax.
In addition, even if you think about the allocation question, you don't have to say that the amount you have actually received is different from the amount you should have.
And I think the amount I received will be reported as sales.
The gift shall not be given as an individual if the opponent is not aware of it.
Obviously, if there is a price (e.g. the sale of real estates) to deal with at a price away from the original price for tax avoidance, it is a problem to calculate taxes.
However, as this time, the third party will not decide whether the appropriate price of tax is reasonable for those who have been trading without conflict.
Personally, I think it's a poison to pay 1 yen.
[Interviewed Cooperation Tax Agency] Yukio Ando After graduating from the university, after graduating from the university, he registered a tax accountant in 2008 after working as a bank.
A wide range of activities such as university lecturers, seminars and writing.
It is well-known for easy-to-understand explanations for beginners.
it's a big panic.
The White House officials said that on Thursday, the new Democratic Party's impoverishment pressure would be a leap forward, and the details of this issue showed that there was no plans to deal with new realities.
The person close to the White House said that the appeal of internal accusations on the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have increased concerns, anxiety, and worry about the possibility that the President and some peripherals will damage greatly.
He said, "I don't know what is happening."
The White House officials said that there was no obvious plan on this situation, and the possibility that the President could not apply the usual measures for the president's efforts to deal with the matter in the past was very serious, so there was no confidence in how to proceed, "I don't seem to be able to get rid of the news reported next."
Another person in charge of this dispute expressed the atmosphere in the White House that has improved the alarming mind in order to increase the likelihood of the President's constant gauge response.
Another concern is that the pressure of the President is expected to be raised daily, while the pressure of the President is said to be more "responsive."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable behavior and concerns about the possibility of a violent attack on unexpected means, and is concerned about President and politics in the environment of the election year.
Trump has faced the greatest threat to the president's term, and has changed his position to the defenses, such as restoring the strategy that he considered effective during the Russian investigation by Robert Morler.
Trump tried to light his request to the President of Ukraine, who wanted to cooperate with the government's investigation, and tried to undermine the credit of the internal accusations as the motive for the candidate of the Democratic Party and Joe Biden.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the trial of Moler's investigation, but this time they began to feel the difference.
Although the power is branded president, he seems to have been in the press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed a question about Russia's alleged investigation, but it seems that it was not the heart of answering questions about Ukraine.
The internal accusations have a person who is aware of the fact that President Trump and the President of Ukraine did not have direct information on the call, claiming that it would undermine the credibility of the internal accused, and that the damage could be reduced.
Furthermore, it is often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of the support layer to defend the facts.
However, the Republican Party's strategic house near the White House pointed out that the basic support rate of the president is already very high and the effects of the acquisition of new supporters by impeachment will not be too much.
In particular, if the prosecution interferes with the legislative draft, the news will be monopolized at 4-6 o'clock, "There is no benefit to concentrate on the appeal of the President."
Another information muscle said that those who claim that the impeachment could be helped by the president did not fully understand how much the president responds to it.
The White House officials who are concerned are seeking advice to the advisors to organize the impeachment team.
According to the officials who explained the bones of this plan, this initiative is still in the early stages, but it is still unclear how to implement such initiatives as a strategic decision room.
However, this person has recognized that the publication of organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, and the release of critical internal accusations, and the release of the public prosecutors' reports need a clear and clear leader that can be organized effectively to counter the momentum of the Democratic Party's impeachment activities.
According to the details about this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspective is clearly visible, including the lack of long-term strategic viewpoints, stating that the Secretary of State Mike Pompoo and the Secretary of Finance of Steven Munewin would not publish notes on calls with President Trump's Ukraine for 48 hours.
According to the person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the investigation of the Robert Molller, who had been involved in this case is called the outside pitble of Trump, who served as the head of the former election.
However, Luwandiuski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would become the leader of such efforts.
"I've been here for five years to support the President and the Policy, but I've never talked with the president and closes about participating in the team who will counter this false accusation."
Trump's external lawyer, Jay Se Crow, is also involved in the efforts of impeachment.
In the interview of NBC News, Se Crow replied that "the problem is properly processed."
After the arrest of Clinton and the end of the Moler investigation, Emmet Flod left the White House, and the current White House legal advisor Pat Siporon has no experience, and the White House currently has a lack of legal counsel.
More information about the White House's strategy is generally far away from the establishment of human resources invitations and strategic countermeasures teams, but it is recognized that all organizations need to lead the efforts and political struggle to respond to the total power.

in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, electric vehicles and Tesla trucks and semis are exclusive to the news, but the only thing to fly is that renewable energy is missing.
However, the University of Alberta developed a technology to use renewable biofuels as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bressler, a professor at the Department of Biological Sciences, Alberta, started the project in 2003.
The laboratory has developed carbonated hydrogen fuel from lipid waste such as oil fat, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low-quality fats to produce, and carbon emissions are less than 85% of the oil base fuel, making it possible to use other industrial waste during production.
This technique also affects the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude fuel.
Dr. Bresler said, "This technology achieved in the first generation is the hydrocarbon of molecules in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for use of biofuels, conventional biofuel technologies tend to be unstable at low temperatures, causing serious problems to move high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is something like jirenma," Dr. Bresler said.
There is no value for diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler is currently focusing on two options as a jet biofuel.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires another treatment of hydrocarbon fuel and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue research on chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler explained the second option: "You can try the reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is high risk.
As airlines and Canada and the U.S. Army have invested in renewable options, Forbes, a subsidiary of the University of Alberta, is working on productization.
"They're predicting that someday someone will impose carbon taxes in the future."
I would like to prepare for the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, and recently invested 400 million US dollars from Lockheed Martin to build a production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 1900 million tons of biofuel.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the effects of fuel transport and production methods are not reduced.
"As a technical shop," he says.
My job is to create an option to make multiple choices parallel with the decision taken by the explanation.

The Bolis Johnson Campaign warnings that Britain faces riots like Los Angeles when Brexit is over.
In this country, there is a danger of "the violent riots by the public" in which the second referendum would cover the first results, and the senior minister said last night.
The senior officials of the Prime Minister warned the British would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the riots of citizens in the size of the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
Johnson stated that he had to "response anger" against a violent political word, but he argued that he did not use the word "fault."
In spite of the Prime Minister's refusal to regain calmness, the Ministers said in the Times: "This country has never happened like the Zile Joene and Los Angeles riots in 1992.
People don't think that there is no riot in this country just because they have never happened.
There's already a yellow best movement, they've compiled a demo that encrypts the cell phone, and then there's a few leaders of the poppylist who can use dirty hands.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 with four white policemen who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King, saying that the jury was innocent.
In this year, the French anti-government demonstrations, wearing the yellow best, led to confusion and destruction in the city of Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out the warning of Johnson in the House of Representatives, stating that if the British failed to withdraw the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If you vote for 30 million people in the referendum, 66% of those who remain in the EU, this Ministers say, "If you vote in the referendum, 100 million people are dissatisfied."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, they would not give up to 100,000 people who were very angry to write letters to the House of Representatives.
There are thousands of people doing so far.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum would cover the first results, there would be danger that "the violent riots by the public" would occur in this country.
Johnson wants to take part in the general election and take the decision of Brexit to the voters.
Johnson was reported to face the rebellion of the House of Representatives who sought to beat the EU in a compromise attempt instead.

It will increase the feeling and show the results of the measures in the pitch.
(Mr. Kobayashi)
exposure to large amounts of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack.
It is shown in the latest research that the risk of the heart disease may be higher after working around pesticides.
This is the result of a tracking survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to men who were not working around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, writing on medical records that contain pesticide exposure in work and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease."
Dr. Rodrigues is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii.
This is the result of the study of data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Ohushima, who participated in the Kakini Honolulu heart program.
This study suggests that women and other races may not apply to women or other races.
Because of the long half-life of pesticides, the effects of health may appear after years after exposure.
This study showed the biggest impact within 10 years after exposure.
"As a result of the 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important."
This is probably because the importance of other factors associated with aging population increases, and in his later years, it hides possible relationships between pesticides and cardiovascular diseases.
Researchers found that exposure to pesticides in low and medium concentrations, heart disease and heart attack are not important.
Zellensky Trump's phone meeting with Polo Shenko
The lawsuit against President Donald Trump took place a week in Washington's political issue.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners.
But what's going on on the zensky Trump phone issue?
At the beginning of the telephone meeting, Trump said that the United States had many conveniences in Ukraine from other European countries.
Although the call record published by the White House is not repeated, it is described in detail that Trump was dedicated to talking about the specific proposal by the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders.
It is said that the response of Zerensky, who opposed Trump to 100%, is disputed.
Zellensky added that both the president and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
This conversation was inspired by politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties.
President Peter Polochenko wrote on Twitter that "there is no prior support from the EU."
In addition to that, Polo Shenko tweeted that he was grateful to support the EU sanctions and economic assistance in the invasion of Russia.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Votiica, said, "Is it possible to negotiate with Germany and France again?"
Then Trump asked the military aid and asked Zellensky to take two surveys, not one, and the first one suggested that the Ukrainians were involved in the e-mail intrusion of the Democratic Democratic Party during the 2016 election and investigated the servers of the Democratic National Committee.
It is unclear whether this would interfere with the European Union, or whether the French and German leaders would have left behind water.
I don't want anyone to say evil.
As a result of the announcement of the call recording, Zerensky stated in the New York General Assembly.
Zellensky will be meeting with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the Normandy 4 summit scheduled in October.

The product may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our communities and children, so the police always warn people to avoid such activities.
In the middle of the concert, the earthquake struck 6 strong!
Emergency training at the Hall of Miyazaki - Yahoo! News
When the earthquake occurred during the concert, a practice-type evacuation training was held at the Hall of Miyazaki City.
This training is held every year.
At the stage, the performance by the Miyazaki City Firefighters was performed, and it is assumed that the earthquake of 6 strong earthquakes in the middle of the song would occur.
Approximately 300 people participated in training for 27 days, including kindergartens, local residents, and hall staff.

The lost dress of Elizabeth I, the Hampton Court Palace Exhibition
It was woven with silver foil yarns made of the finest camlet silk, which were made of plants, beasts, butterfly luxury embroidery.
Hersque Royal Palace dress collection curator, Erie Lin, said it was one point.
One piece of cloth, which was put on the wall of a small church in the countryside, was placed there 100 years ago, and was considered part of the clothes lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after the discovery of this luxurious cloth, which was used as the altarpiece of the church in the Canton of Helefordshire, it is planned that Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited near that room that could be worn over 450 years ago.
The rest of the dress in the 16th century showed that it was an important discovery in the entire Royal dress collection.
Although Elizabeth had no perfect evidence of taking sleeves in his dress, he was convinced that the dress was not a town of royal possession for three years.
The most expensive textiles with silver threads were prepared only by the royal family by law, but the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen, and bears added later also suggests that the original owner was a noble person.
At that time the dress was made, it seems that the price was equivalent to one house of the Tudor family.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of Elizabeth's morning, it is speculated that the Queen would be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, and the rival wearing such luxurious clothes would not be tolerated.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to publish, so I came to see my colleagues.
Everyone was happy to hear that cloth, and I was always looking at the Royal dress one."
A long second life, one of the dresses used as the altar cloth of the Holy Face Church of Canton, which is not the first, seems to be unexpected.
Kubton is said to have been a village of Bransh Paley, who served as a female officer throughout the long life of Elizabeth's Queen.
The dress dates back to 1590 after Paley's death, but the experts believe that they must have been promoted to family or church before Elizabeth died in 1603.
For more than 1000 hours of repair, the altar cloth with a very delicate hand sewn silk and thin surgical needle will be exhibited next to Elizabeth's portrait, one of the most praised contemporary paintings that have been borrowed from the Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The vast space as much as possible as possible to store some of the very expensive pastries is only a greenhouse that has been renovated on the Hampton Court grounds, and the conservation work is done here, and Liby Thompson said, "We are dealing with historical cloths and we really feel respect for the craftsmanship of the artisans who made it."
When you look at the embroidery on the back of the table, it is a great respect for those who made this.
I had never seen this sophisticated work before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held from October 12 at Hampton Court Palace.

The International Space Station (ISS) has successfully caught the No. 8 of the International Space Station, and the JAXA staff, who applause, will be provided by JAXA on 28th.
At the end of the 28th night of the station, an unmanned supply aircraft (JAX) of the Space Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAX) carrying supplies to the International Space Station of about 400 kilometers, astronauts were able to manipulate the robot arm during their stay.
It was launched on 25th from the Seed Island Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by the control of the JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, the speed difference is less than 10 meters away.
The robot arm of the length of 176m is the flow of the pump.
There are about 5 and 3 tons of supplies.
After the installation of the station, the crew will carry the luggage.
i'm involved in the three-quarters of the Mexican drug cartel, the U.S.
Shortly after the sunrise of Chicago Westside, CBS News captured the rusher of drug transactions.
It was revealed that Brian McQueen of the Drug Control Bureau (DEA) was held in the white days.
Over 800 people died in Chicago last year.
McQueen said that the drug's " probably 90%" was brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the king of Mexican drug called El Mencho and Nemecio Servantes.
He said, "The Mencho is the top priority of the federal law enforcement agency in Mexico."
The award received by El Mencho reached $1,000.
With the help of Donah, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were violent.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisko Nueba, is involved in at least one third of the drug being brought to the United States on land and seaways.
According to the Ministry of Justice, Caltel sold a large quantity of cocaine, methane fetamin, and fertilyl mixed heloin.
El Mencho's neck is worth $1 million.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California for thirty years, but was arrested and sent back to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel.
They have a large amount of weapons, a crewed rocket, and a 50-meter caliber.
In fact, he also owned his own special maneuvers and said Donah.
After six deaths from the Mexican Army helicopters, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, there are thousands of murders that have been caused by the fight against drug cartel.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, about 94 murders occurred on a day.
In Chicago, the stolen Mexican drugs are toxic, so they must wear protective clothes during handling.
In the manufacturing center, the seal of the cokine bag is pressed.
More than one third is thought to have been produced by El Mencho.
Donah said, "Mencho is involved in the influx of harmful substances that have virtually taken the life of women and children."
In other words, when someone died, he said that the drug that was brought from the organization of El Mencho was "produce."
Over 67,000 Americans died last year.

Sony, Playstation 4 Supply News, PS4 games, a long time ago
Sony revealed the contents of the last part of the PS4 limited to the PS4.
As part of the recent state-of-play announcement, Sony announced its release on February 2020.
A part of this new action game was also presented to fans.
The last of the two major announcements have been published several days later.
Sony and Noty Dog seem to return to the wind in various ways.
Since the PSwan era, the Last of As Part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Neil Dollackman of Norttydog announced that the sequel evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense, the story is spectacular and complicated," he said.
In this way, it was necessary to talk about stories with many characters.
It was not the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolds, and the user felt the end, but in fact, it started and realized that all other sections started.
The game did not enter a single blue ray, but it was two discs.
In addition, the last of the As Part 2 includes one of the bad Easter eggs (from Gamespot) that open at work.
Although there is no shortage of this stock, the Easter Egg in the game includes the works of nostalgic Normans.
On February 21, 2020, the Last of the As Part 2 was released on PS4 only, so you can see more.
Those who have PS4 can pick up the last of the remastered with PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced the free PS4 game of Play Station Plus, including Noty Dogs, as described above.
The MLB Za Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie backpacks and bracelet replicas, 12-inch figures.
The Notoshima Transportation Promotion Committee attempts to encourage residents to continue (North Korean Newspaper) - Yahoo! News
As a result of the aging of the population, on the island of Notoshima, 7o City, which decreased the number of stores, the movement was started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council.
During the trial of December, the day-to-day Susomachikai and the half-ura-cho Kaikai were on the first day.
In addition to the products that were sold more than expected, the residents asked the residents to continue asking for "a fun choice of goods."
A total of 110 cars, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
A total of vegetables such as potato salads that were divided into the pack so that it could be eaten by one person's elderly.
At the Suso-cho meeting, a group of residents was created and salt and sugar were sold out.
"I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizu branch (83) of Notoshima Suso-cho, who is usually shopping at her husband's driving, said, "I don't know if my father can drive, and I hope it will continue."
The user also received orders such as "Don't Coffee," but "I want you to add coffee to my own."
The Council examines the requirements.
At Noto Island, there are only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the Council tried to save "shopless."
From December to December, it is considered that 20 towns in the island can continue as business since the next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed the decision to add about $1 billion to residents affected by drought.
The cash support policy for farmers affected by droughts was extended and the existing farmers' allowances were significantly improved.
For additional assistance, approximately 33,000 million dollars were recorded to the residents' support organizations for drought damage, and the target farmers were able to receive emergency assistance for $3,000.
As a regional grant program for drought damage, each of the 13 municipalities will provide up to $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought prevention measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded a budget of more than $70 billion as a drought support.
Ronald Lee Haskel: a former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted of killing four of the five children in Springfield, Texas, 2014.
Haskel said on July 9, 2014, when he was forced to stay at the house, his wife Melney Haskel asked him where he was.
Melney was absent, but his sister Chity Stay and his family.
Haskel fired and reported that he died of his 13-year-old son, nine-year-old and seven-year-old daughter.
In his family, only one of the 15-year-old cashy St. Mary's men died.
At that time, the authorities reported serious injuries and reports, but it was completely restored.
On Thursday, the jury dismissed all the charges of innocence due to the loss of the heart of Ronald Lee Haskel.
The jury was dismissed from the monthly execution process.
"If you choose to be disappointed, you will never forgive us."

Global warming increases serious.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in New York, the 16-year-old environmental activist Gregory expressed his speech to strengthen measures.
In addition to boycotting classes and sitting in front of the legislature, the school strike was expanded across the world.
The young people who were interested in anxiety and anxiety were protesting all over the world including Japan.
More than 4 million people have participated in the event.
He also made a message board in Morioka.
The threat of climate change is approaching.
The Paris Agreement, which is launched in 2020, aims to minimize the global greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the century and reduce the temperature of less than twice before the Industrial Revolution.
All participating countries have been implemented without distinction between developed countries and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to the relationship between climate change, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, has been pointed out.
We need to strengthen our efforts to achieve a rapid pace of global warming.
At the summit held by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to strengthen the crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to zero by 50 years.
More than 70 countries raised their goals for the time.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which expressed the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not explicitly express the new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the power of the nuclear power has become a form.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy states that as early as the latter half of the century, the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no chance to speak at the summit.
In the meeting of the environmental-related meeting, Masajiro Koizumi, who performed Japan's efforts on climate change, said that he should work on fun, cool, and sexy.
Although the appeal does not deny, it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
It is now a symbol of environmental movement.
The scars that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "transmission of the question" that the person opposes.

and one step to realize quantum internet
The results of the U.S. Army's research results approached the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to secure military safety, measure and measurement capabilities that were impossible to address conventional networks.
According to the U.S. Army Research Center, a distributed quantum information center for combat capacity development, researchers from the University of Innsbruck achieved a record of quantum empowerment between materials and light - 50 km using optical fiber cables.
Entangling is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If the two quantum bits are in the Entang state and the other quantum bits are measured on one side, even if the other quantum bits are physically distant, the measurement results are affected by another.
"This distance [50 km] is more than two digits than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building a quantum network between cities."
The urban quantum network is composed of a network between physical quantum bits in Entang, despite the large distance.
The dispersion of this empowerment is absolutely essential to the establishment of the quantum Internet, and researchers say.
"This proof is a big step to realize a large-scale distributed empowerment," says Dr. Sarah Gambling, Deputy Secretary of the Army Program to support research.
In addition, the entropy at the exit of the fiber is kept enough to satisfy the number of conditions required for some difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser rays to write quantum states on ions and at the same time excited to release photons saved by quantum information.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became the Entangil state.
The challenge is to send the photon to the optical fiber cable.
"The wavelength of the photon emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and the optical fiber cable is absorbed immediately."
The Doctor's team first sent light particles through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, which are the standard wavelengths of current distance communication.
Later, the photon was sent through a fiber fiber cable of 50 kilometers long.
In the measurement results, even though the atoms and light particles moved long distances to convert the wavelengths, they maintained the Entangur state.
"The use of calcium atoms can capture calcium at the same time as high-quality "clock" quantum bits, so the results of this experiment will lead to the realization of a network of entropy at long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangling clock network is a very important field for the Army from the viewpoint of accurate positioning measurement, navigation and application of time."
