Croatia plans for nuclear treatment facilities, Bosnians protest
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnian towns and protested the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the only nuclear power plant near the river known for beautiful nature near the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The demonstration participants gathered in the town of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly urged Croatia to abandon plans to store the site of the barracks of the Turkovska Gola and fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant.
The Bosnian people said that the nuclear waste treatment facility could threaten the lives of about 250,000 people living in the Unagawa River and surrounding areas, such as "aggravating a healthy future," "the river needs us."
We must oppose.
The mayor of Novigrad, Miloslav Rodrika, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the rivers.
The Kursko nuclear power plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is co-owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
On Friday, the Croatian state broadcast reported that Croatia should build its own storage facilities, or that Slovenia would still not decide whether to pay the cost of the Croatian waste processed in a newly constructed facility.
Mr. To Miss Love Chorich, Minister of Environmental Protection of Croatia, told the announcer that Croatia had problems in the waste disposal of public facilities from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wanted to find full solutions.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents of the country claimed that Croatia would search for another construction site near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket be the best place in the whole Croatia?"

The police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
The police said that children were placed in an inhuman environment, but the school denied this claim.
The residents who call the pastor of the school said, "They are in school with all parents' consent, so their claims are not true."
"In front of the child's admission, parents signed their consent.
Since parents came to deliver meals to children every day, they know what environment is.
It was very surprising that the police came and removed the children, and after all the food delivered by parents left, the school closed.
This is an unfair treatment for parents who can testify whether the police had children in a terrible environment.

Central Coast's "super evil undo" girl raped and ordered to face victims in court.
In May 2017, a man wearing a dark-colored gilly suit worn by leaves caught a 12-year-old girl behind the school in Central Coast in the state.
After that, the man was forced to kill a girl and had sexual assault.
Shortly after the arrest, the police arrested a number of items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, he was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges against this assault and another 11-year-old girl, Griming, and sexual abuse.
When the 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on the road, he saw a large tree branches and a knife armed man suddenly coming out of the bush.
When a girl asks, "Don't stop, stop it."
He said, "I'm going to get a big voice.
When I heard a loud voice, I said, "I'm not going to hurt you."
The man had a knife on his right hand and his hands of a girl tied up with a cable Thailand, and was tortured for nearly a hour.
The girl ran into a school where she screams like crazy.
The man did not respond to a number of mobile mails and telephones from work colleagues, but arrived at work at 9:30 AM.
The man stood out in the clothes of mud, grass, trees, etc., and claimed that he had been involved in street violence and was chasing the driver to the bush.
The man's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development is based on public interests and warns IT companies.
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, investors, and others that there was a fear that artificial intelligence development competition and other digital development would increase social inequality.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference, where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met in one hall.
In this meeting, a number of scholars and Catholic bishops were invited to the public benefit of the digital age.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions on future sex and danger in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of war technology and increased machinery work, and at the same time, examples of the gunfire incident in Christ Church in New Zealand and the response of social media companies during the violent video spill were also conducted.
In his speech at the meeting, Pope praised the development of technological progress, citing the danger and simplicity of workers in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely on robot engineering to pursue profit, you might be afraid to take the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances are more and more likely to cause inequality, it is not true progress."
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, we will be able to reverse the state of a kind of barbarian based on the theory of strong people.
According to the conference organizer, I would like to use the expertise of participants in this conference to find people who can become a future advisor to the Catholic Church in high-tech areas.

Real Madrid loaned the player Martin Wudegor, and the fan excitement with the help of Nintendo.
Martin Woodward gave a surprise to Michel Oyalusabal's predecessor, and showed the help of heaven.
Real Madrid won the Ossasna at 2-0 and renewed the undefeated record in the current domestic season, leading the La Liga ranking.
However, despite the lack of a single match in La Liga this season, he has been exposed to pressure by Zinediene Zidan, such as the fierce open battle and the lack of public relations with the Welsh star Gares Baker.
The pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience when Real Madrid was humiliated by Paris Sangelman (PSG).
However, Jimine Zidan and Real Madrid seem to have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Viniius Juniole is one of the stars that took such a future in Real Madrid and is currently playing the team.
However, while renting to Real Socieda, another young Norwegianman Martin Udegor also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Wudegor played against Real Socieda vs Albes, and was surprised by Michel Oyalusabal's predecessors, and Real Socieda won his home in 3-0.
Martin Udegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite path through the inside of another two players to Oyalusabar, and decided to take the ball completely accurate.
With the goal of the second goal of Willian Joze and the third penalty spot of the stunning Oyalusabar, Albeth's Midfillder, Manuel Garcia, was able to secure the overwhelming victory of the Imano team just before the end of 5 minutes.
Martin Udegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to make his reputation.
The Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally made this territory.
Anna Hazale, Maharashtra's co-financed bank, was surprised by the name of Sharad Powerle.
Anna Hazale said, "The name of Sharad Powerr was not in the list when he contacted this lawsuit."
A social activist Anna Hazale showed a surprise that the leader of the Sharado Powerll, the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud involving thousands of rubys, suddenly emerged.
The Executive Bureau (ED) of the Investigation Agency (ED) filed a financial cleaning lawsuit against the Deputy Minister of State Sharad Powerle, his nephew, Aquit Powerr Motoharashtra, in connection with the fraud.
According to the Act on Preventing Funding, the report of the Executive Bureau, comparable to the first report of the police, was registered by the Central Authority.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, which was charged with the name of the former chairman of the Bank and the name of the former staff of the 70 co- union bank.
When he contacted the lawsuit, his name was not anywhere.
On Thursday, Anna Hazale asked questions about the lawsuits and suspicions that Sharad Powerr was involved in the fraud incident, saying that "the name of Sharad has emerged, and who mentioned it is only what they know."
Anna Hazale, criticizing Sharad Powerle, expressed his expectation that the Executive Bureau would reveal the truth if detailed investigation into the fraud case.
A veteran of numerous corruption prevention activities, Anna Hazale said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerle denied any fraud and claimed that there was no relationship with the co-bank; on October 21, he questioned the timing of the legal registration just a few weeks before the election of the Maharashtra state election.
The former minister clearly referred to the government led by the Indian People's Party and stated that he would not be forced before Delhi's "Lord."
The NCP referred to the lawsuits by the Executive Bureau as a formality.

The accelerator pedal stop the accident!
Four possible sudden prevention devices - Yahoo! News
you can't afford a reasonable price.
Traffic accidents caused by driving mistakes.
Among them, the accident caused by the brakes and accelerators by older drivers is on an increasing trend.
In particular, when you move forward, you will become a panic and you will be on the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with a safety driving support feature that covers such a driver's mistakes, but there is also a rearing device that can be mounted on unsuitable vehicles.
Such after-sale parts manufacturers are developing and selling sudden prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what features each have.
The distance between the accelerator and the brake pedals is narrower and the same way.
[e-ACCEL ALRM] The new point of view is to inform the pedal mistake developed by Pibot.
The pedal's step mistake is to avoid using the alarm sound.
The mechanism occurs when the brake is wrong and the accelerator pedal is required when it is stopped or slow driving.
The sound reacts to the sound and stimulates the accelerator back, allowing rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the step mistakes.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the acceleration mistake, and it is also effective for elderly drivers to hear.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the body is placed on both sides.
The price is around 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is also attractive that the set needs.
The World Wing started its release in mid-September, but the accelerator brake step-by-step fault prevention device "Aha-san" was used.
It is also possible to withdraw without advance.
When the accelerator pedal was suddenly set up in advance and retreat from the stop (and less than 10Km/h), the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected and electrically suppresses the accelerator opening and suppresses rapid progress.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, you cannot tell the signal from the accelerator, and quickly control the progress by making the cleaner running state (where the brake is removed in the D range).
At the time of retreat (back) there is also a function that detects a car speed of about 5Km/h and reduces the vehicle to the cleaner state.
The installation is only possible with a caparon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (tax excluded).

The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, where there were five children from 4 to 12 years old, was soaked in water around the house.
"I can't escape with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend time at home as much as possible in a disaster.
"There's no right to prepare," he said.
Ms. Kawazaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, who has a six-year-old and eight-year-old child, suggested that the elementary school had an e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school has no email system.
There was also a request to build a system that could be shared in real time on the flooded roads.
Mr. Kawazaki said, "I don't understand that the weather has changed before, and "It was okay last time."I want to take care of the connection between small ideas and people and prepare for disaster."
Mr. Tanaka said, "I think the opinions were made to convey the government as a organization."
Contact the police agency with Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Curri.
The Police Agency (IOPC) will consider whether the President of London should examine the Prime Minister Johnson as a violation of penal code.
The London Administration (GLA) announced that the Director General of the GLA had recorded the matter on the act of Prime Minister's prime minister regarding the suspicion that he had been given preferential treatment due to the friendly relations with Prime Minister.
"There is information that there is a possibility of criminal activity," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this issue.
The problem was entrusted with IOPC, but IOPC is an organization that corresponds to charges issued by the police in England and Wales.
The problem was that Johnson was in charge of the police officer's office at that time.
Johnson denied fraud related to the relationship between his friends.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's orders to seek detailed information about his relationship with the Archici.
Although this statement was reported by the Sunday Times, it was reported that Johnson was paid for £126,000 from public money during the Mayor of London seven years ago, and was encouraged to participate in three times in foreign trade-related dispatchers.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to the company, the hacker house in the survey.
The company will ask questions about the investigation process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
In the House of Representatives, the Digital Ministry said that the company owns the British phone number.
However, according to a number of reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office, which is believed to have been located at the site.
The relationship between Prime Minister and female businessmen was "the secret between the staff."
The movement of the GLA, which attempts to attach the Prime Minister to police agencies, touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
The government's high-ranking officials said that this was a "political attack" and that the timing of the Conservative Party's previous night was "too party-oriented."
"With regard to any charges, the director did not submit evidence, and the Prime Minister was given the opportunity to respond to the director's agency before the announcement of the press that was published late on Friday."
The public and the media will also take a look at the political Kyogen that was organized by AMA.
As I mentioned earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that Johnson and California businessmen had supported London's tourism promotion and regional promotion.
The former staff of London and Partners (L&P) said that despite the fact that he had thought that the company was "accreditable" at that time, he had a privilege to accompany the foreign trade-related talks led by the Mayor Johnson.
A security fund that allows ordinary people to use property formation!
Today, the 20th anniversary of the Yawa Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard the future prospects of Mr. Tatsuo Sawakami, President and CEO of Yukinobu YUKI.
"The Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary in August this year.
What are you feeling today?
First, in the history of 20 years, many people had their thoughts and efforts.
I would like to express my deep appreciation for all the people involved, not the history that has played with the power of the Fund.
Originally, I came up with a desire to support the formation of property for general living people.
This spirit has remained unchanged, and has been pursued for 20 years.
We believe that the world will be brighter from the foundation and encourage our daily operations to become a whole company.
For a long period of time, operations do not work together with beneficiaries.
There are a lot of money, such as the Lehman shock and the burst of IT bubble.
"We hope to support companies that are needed in the world since this time," I feel that we have understood the messages we have mentioned since the day.
As a result, I believe that it was the reason why it became a long-term fund for 20 years and that it continued to be a direct sales system to deliver messages directly to many people.
At the end of each month, we disclose all investment companies, amounts and costs.
Generally speaking, information about what you're buying now is black box, but all the funds have been disclosed.
Why can we trust you?
mc Miller's death, the third drug arrester.
Los Angeles (AP) - Last year Rapper's Mac Miller was associated with a drug crime that died in excess of drugs, and the third man was arrested.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit pills of oxycodon, which had been accidentally possession of cocaine, alcohol, and Fentanil before he died, but Fentanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has spread over thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is charged with sin as another person who sold drugs to Miller, who supplies drugs to Cameron Petet.
According to a trial published on Tuesday, Pettyt had acquired drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Livis, who was arrested in Lake Habus City, Arizona at the beginning of this week, was asked to take drugs to Pettyt as Walter's " Deliveryer."
All three are not directly charged with the death of Miller, and there are still anti-bents about individual cases.
Walter is currently in custody because he was under probation supervision in 2005 and has already been sentenced to five months in prison for violations of his compliance.
On Thursday, the first public prosecutors in charge of this report reported by the celebrity site TZ requested Walter to be detained until the trial starts due to the possibility of escape abroad.
There was no immediate reply to a lawyer.
Pettyt was charged with the federal court on September 4, but the defenders refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics have been described as a direct word for depression and drug use, and he has gained a fan as one of the Great Palaces in hip hops.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name, Marcom James Meyers McCick, was a two-year-old singer, Ariana Grande, but was defeated in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a mirror video of love with his own instagram and published a song about the mirror, "San Que Neckst."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in recent years associated with Opioid drug abuse.
The rock band's guitarist Matthew Roberts died in 2016 due to excessive drug intake, and the body was detected by Fentanyl and hydrocodon.
In this article, he revised the name of Walter instead of Steven.
More than 30 mobile games in Nigeria
This 9-year-old child uses a free programming app called scratch2 to produce a sowing game.
With scratch2, games, animations and stories can be produced offline.
Until now, Basil has created over 30 mobile games using this app.
Today's games are programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch a bat from the hiding place.
He learned how to make a game in a short-term intensive course.
Mr. Basil told CNN that he spent time making games when boring.
In March, his father applied for a short-term intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
This course hosted by Code Fest International was introduced to children like Basil to provide opportunities to experience new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in many mobile games.
"When I was 4 years old I bought a tablet.
Candace crashes and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, he became interested in the game production.
"One day I was wearing a tablet as usual, but I was so excited about the game, so I got a little belly."
He said, "I've always been playing games, but how do I make a game myself so that others can play?"
When he said, he was angry, and he didn't think he would care about it."
Since then, Basilchan, who has been interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step of the game production.
Basilchan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has the name of his game.
One of the games, "Moskyto Mash" can be purchased by Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if Africa's innovation becomes the world, the young generation, such as Basil, has the power to lead.
Recently, two of the twelve-year-old Nigerians have been awarded a robot that uses the program code to separate housework.
In May 2019, the Ghana Women's High School Team, which programmed a box-load robot, won the event.
Africa's investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil-chan and the children of the same age are trying to become a future programming star.
Former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, a false proof of bribery.
According to the Court documents submitted on Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to have false evidence to the Federal agent who conducted the investigation of corruption related to major political donors.
In the list of federal courts lawsuits, Robin Hayes will be convicted on Wednesday next week.
According to the fact that he was prepared as part of the judiciary transaction and signed by Hayes, Hayes was aware of the false statement of FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed and the documents based on facts are not specified to which sin is accepted.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery and false statements.
The prosecutors accused him of being involved in the insurance company's heavy duty plan on behalf of the state's insurance director for special treatment.
The two co-owners of Greg Lindberg and his co-owners were charged with attempted bribes to the Secretary of Health, Mike Cozy.
Lindberg, the founder of the insurance and investment company, donated more than $500 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported Republican principles and politicians, but was also offered to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer called for a comment on Friday and email.
On Friday, Hans Davis also requested additional comments via e-mail.
The Court documents submitted to Friday stated that Hayes was falsely quoted by FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes did not speak with the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to the facts, Hayes was actually talking about the request of personnel transfer from the State Insurance Agency and the Insurance Bureau from Lindberg.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindberg's request that he would like to meet with Corsey and also talked about direct bribes with the director.
In April, the prosecution announced that Lindberg would seek special treatment for his own insurance business, and he was planning to take over the election campaign aimed at reelection in 2020.
According to the prosecution, the conspiracy involved a request to replace the authorities who had reviewed the company in Lindberg.
Republican Corsey reported to federal agents who attempted bribes and helped them.
There is no doubt about Coggie.
In the case of prosecution, the co-owner of Lindberg instructed Hayes to send $25 million to Corsey's reelection campaign.
According to the prosecution, Hayes was initially opposed to taking care of the expensive money, but eventually broke out in the conversation.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes said, "What do you want?"
i understand.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office of Public Prosecutors' Office asked E-mail to ask for more information about judicial transactions.
It's a good idea to improve the happiness of Facebook and users!
In the first attempt to raise the user's happiness, some users would like to post others soon!
This change followed by the similar test of Instagram in Australia in July.
The new Facebook attempt began on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager Amy Garrick said that this change is based on feedback from mental health experts who think that the number of social comparisons will cause.
Garrick said, "There was a very positive feedback from many bullishing groups and mental health organizations working together."
It is only to remove numbers so that users can focus on the quality and quality of exchanges, rather than the number of actions.
Garric said that it would be hoped that the user would be able to share it with this platform rather than feel competitive.
Garrick claimed that business operators with Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
Instagram tests such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, and other countries, it is time to say that testing is similar.
Instagram, under Facebook, has not announced whether this test will end or will remain unchanged.
"There were initially positive feedback on experience in Instagram, but now it is a stage of listening to feedback and learning."
Garric, who is in Australia in the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very positive "experienced technology" Facebook and Instagram users.
He thought Australia would be a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

Self- repair of broken bag fittings! 【Candu】 " holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo!
One day, my mother's most favorite bag was removed and I couldn't move somewhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it and continue to love it.
When I helped him, I was a part of Kand's handcraft.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag is the ultimate prism.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair the repair, the price of the body was significantly higher.
Unfortunately, my mother said, "I don't want to give up."
First, I went to the Home Center and looked for what would be replaced by this connected gear.
However, even if there is a ring-shaped metal, everything is silver.
Gold didn't look at it.
When I went to Candu, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it in the handicraft corner.
As expected, there are 100 levels and everything.
Originally it seems to be part used for key holders and craft DIY.
It was planned to use one by one on both ends of the bag handle and bought two pieces.
Although the size of the ring is small, but when you lined up with the bag fittings on the left side, make the same thing exactly!
We opened the way to repair bags.
It is attached.
what?
The ring openings are designed to break inside and are resistant to pulling outwards.
I installed it in a bag.
The color of the gold is good!However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor.
So I made a two-phase ring with my thoughts.
Because of its lightweight parts, there is no problem with weight.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts that have been cracked has increased and the design level has been improved.

Pakistan's social media star, Candy Burrought's honorary murder, his brother's life imprisonment.
Mr. Candy Barrowchi, who was famous for his photos posted on social media, was hanged in July 2016.
His brother, who was a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday, and was sentenced to imprisonment with a "resonary murder" that attracted the most attention of his father's country Pakistan.
In July 2016, Barrowchi, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, was hanged.
He was arrested by his brother Muhamad eagle.
After a few days in a press conference, his brother told him that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Saldar Mamoud, a lawyer of the same clan, told AFP that the Court of Murtan in the eastern city had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with a verdict waiting for him.
He said, "It will be innocent in the Supreme Court and will be innocent."
Prior to this, his mother, Anne Wal Mai, told AFP that his son wanted to be innocent.
"There is no sin for his son.
My daughter and my son."
Barrowchi's murder became a major news all over the world, and as a light view of the laws of his father's rights society, the victims, most women, are killed and the voices of women seeking action against the spread of the so-called "resonable murder."
Women chose their own marriage partner, and in the case of Mr. Barrought's case, they were burned in crimes such as praise of their sexuality and ashamed of their families.
The murder is usually done by close relatives.
Later, in Pakistan's Kisars (a murder reward) and Deya (response) law, the perpetrators may be forgiven from their relatives.
After three months of murder, the legislature passed a new bill that required life imprisonment for honorary murder.
However, the murder is entrusted to the court's discretion, and the killer can claim another motive in theory and may be forgiven.
In the case of Mr. Barrowchi, his parents initially claimed that he would not forgive his son.
However, he thought he would lose his son, and his parents changed their thoughts and asked him to forgive his son.
In response to international hatred against the murder, the Pakistani government had an unprecedented means of declaring the country as a successor with his parents, but the lawsuit continued.
His famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket Team and wearing a large red dress on Valentine's Day.
Although criticized and threatened, it was recognized by many people, including young people, when the new heaven and earth opened in a country where it was regarded as a bold and political activity to express themselves as a presence like Kim Kadasian.
The roots of the murders are ethnic social norms, and are still widely preserved in South Asia, especially in women's actions, but men may be victims.

The "Hospitable Sheet Box" box was installed at the "Old Shojuchu Ground" in Tsuruoka City.

As a result of a similar disaster, measures aimed at severe cold and wind rain were one of the challenges.
Seats that can cover the whole body during evacuation can cause cold and wind rain.

When the team from the island expeditions outside the island, they will also work to eliminate the challenges that the trainers are hard to compete with.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center (ASA), which is affiliated with the ASA, in the event of the prefectural tournament, etc.,, we support to prevent the loss of performance of the players due to fatigue in boat trips and nighttimes.

Kenichiro Shigeki said, "Now, the conventional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, Mr. Kenichiro Shigeki has been thinking about "Mote" as a brain scientist.
It was a surprise that the vast knowledge and the latest knowledge were freely used.
Then we will send you a piece.
In the previous edition (see related article), Moteno Otoko is a traditional "man's fantasy" and the pattern learning is overwhelmingly lacking!
Later, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad man and become a cool man.
i'm going to live with you.
In the previous edition, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and people's behavior.
When you learn patterns, you might be able to live in a rack because the brain can systematically organize the action.
I think I'm still evolving every day, as my own "Mote."
So it's cool to live.
When I was teaching at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked to a lot of young people and learned many patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're in the position of a professor at the university, you might be a bit painful if you're in the old pattern that says "The teacher of the university has more dignity."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, you will live by saying, "What should I do?"
But even if I don't change, the society will change.
In my recent talk book, "No matter how terrible the world lives," I talked about it.
It's something that comes naturally with the recognition of the people around him.
I don't think he's not light.
It's hard to get around.
What did you do at Cannes Film Festival?
He would treat himself as a "great film director."
Those who have a record do not need to act as great.
In other words, it can't be light, as it is bound by the sense.
As long as I heard a lot of women, I would like to be punished and saved by any man regardless of position or age.
It's hard to think about this 's cute'.

In the northwest of Nigeria, the number of refugees doubled: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the announcement of the United Nations on Friday, the number of refugees from the northwestern part of Nigeria has doubled due to violent violence in the last four months.
According to the UN Refugee Organization, the "new humanitarian crisis" was created due to this confusion, and each institution cooperated with the government to raise funds for $3550 million by the end of the year.
According to the UNHCR report, the Islamic extremist organization Bokohalam, who has been active in anti-government in northern Nigeria for ten years, stated that it is unrelated to several recent armed attacks.
Rather, violent acts in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina over the last decade were organized by armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal states and unstable situations," said Barrok.
The kidnappers, tortures, assaults, murders and sexual violence often occurred, and the raiders were working on theft, which destroyed housing.
Military and police are also sent to fight crime organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with the West African Branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with the name of the group."
What they're doing is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to the neighboring Niger.
The UNHCR stated in a statement that the security situation in Sokoto was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the next few months.
a new trial date for men killed two women and children was confirmed.
The trial date of the men's trial was confirmed to have killed two women and their children in Iowa.

He claims guilty.
According to the police, on July 16, he was shot down by Rosschild Florence Rodrigues (29), her daughter (11) and his son (5).
In the court's record, a new trial date will be decided on January 27, which will be given time to prepare both the plaintiffs and defendants.
According to the authorities of the U.S. Immigration Bureau, Escobal Orillana was illegal in the United States and was forced back twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal immigration to the United States in 2010.
Sonet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising on header bidding in LFP.
LFP provides services to purchase and planning their own advertising frameworks tailored to advertisers' requests.
The Service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
header bidding is a mechanism that allows you to prioritize the high-priced advertising in media operated by media through fair bid competition with multiple vendors.
As a solution that can be transparent and profitable for media companies, the introduction of large media is progressing.
Until now, SSP has been provided for advertising frames.
In recent years, in response to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to a specific advertising frame with a high affinity with individual commercials and brand images," the LFP was launched in December last year by collaboration with media companies to direct purchase of advertising frames that accompany advertisers' requests.
In response to header bidding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP's header bidding can be directly involved in bids to the header-by-side advertising framework, and it is expected to improve the delivery opportunities for advertising.
As the media is limited, the advertising framework for the delivery of individual goods and brand images is secured and prevents brand value damage.
The benefit of media companies is that the solution for managing the code of Bedder companies, known as the "Rapper Solution," is able to meet the expectations of the introduction of media companies.

On 27 days, Yamagata University announced that he would suspend his 30-year-old son's assistant professor at the U.S. Sawa Campus (U.S. Sawa City) for two months.
This is the same date.
According to the Department of General Affairs, the Assistant Professor of the Department of General Affairs gave a strong sense of stress, in October 2017, when he taught multiple students belonging to the laboratory, he was emotional, and repeatedly criticized by inappropriate words.
He was a professor of education, and was recognized to have deteriorated the school environment.
In a survey conducted in September 1818, several students appealed.
In December of the same year, the Faculty of Engineering's management met with students and assistants, and in December of the same year, he conducted research on harassment prevention measures by instructors at the U.S. Sawa Campus, and finally filed harassment from one student.
In response to the findings from the committee, President Koyama and the Board of Directors decided to punish the punishment.
After the survey, he continued to teach, but his actions were improved and he was told that he was "not sorry."
President Koyama said, "I am deeply concerned with the victims and other stakeholders, and he said, "We are committed to preventing harassment and strive to recover trust."
At the same time, the Faculty of Engineering's men's teachers have conducted internal surveys to determine whether sexual harassment is conducted by female students.
Cabinet's rebellion The Sunpaper demands Boris Johnson to reduce EU withdrawal requests and make compromises with the EU.
Today, only three weeks after the EU summit, which is a place to settle, there is a concern that the Prime Minister has been growing around the prime minister.
Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion in the cabinet that demands the withdrawal of the EU and calls for a compromise with the EU.
The negotiations on a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "operable."
The Senior Ministers would expect the EU's black curtains led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel to propose compromises, such as establishing a three-year time limit on backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers, who are facing the Prime Minister, after the end of the Liberal Party's annual meeting in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the "gravity" strategy, which threatens the EU, which was devised by the senior advisor Dominique Canmings, and insists that the EU will accept the offer that the EU will limit time.
One Ministers said that the ruling that the Supreme Court was illegal on Tuesday would be "the police bell," and the compromise was the only way we could withdraw from October 31.
We will never win in the House of Representatives and they oppose us.
The Prime Minister must use what can be used as a step.
It is not effective even if it is radical, and the plan of Camation is obviously unsuccessful.
It is not possible to fight in many fields.
Another minister promised that he would talk to Johnson to run the agreement with Prime Minister Terryza May.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I would like to speak to Boris to return to the House of Representatives.
As a result, everyone is trying to end this.
If you want to postpone, Boles will end and we will end.
John Mayer accused Boris of not seriously thinking about negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party said, "The prime minister wants to connect the EU with the agreement.
However, we do not look at the fact that the Prime Minister will establish an agreement with the EU.
Instead, we saw that in Scotland, the Prime Minister was fighting with pebbles, inspecting eggs in Ureez, and discussing with the nationals at large streets, as if the election campaign was full of momentum."
The Prime Minister's press said yesterday that the agreement was still a long time ago, "If no one wants to achieve the goal, the road is still long."
However, the press also stated that the bill to force the re- postponement of the three-month re-election would be "very weak in the position of our negotiation."
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders the position of our negotiations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are trying to work hard and move forward despite the establishment of the bill."
The European Union Foreign Minister Steven Barclay returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
They discuss documents about how regulation of all Irish islands on food and livestock works.
Loren Kelly: The Glasgow accent told me that it would not be an absolute success in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, revealed that he was told by the boss of the television station that he would "not succeed."
Prior to his first appearance in the TV screen, he said, "I'm so nervous," and 59-year-old Kelly looked back for 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
She says, "I'm still 25 years old and very nervous."
I was working as a researcher at the BBC Scottish Branch and told my boss that he would not succeed in the absolute TV industry in your Glasgow accent.
Before his departure at the Glasgow office, he went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris had interviewed legendary actress Betty Davis.
I didn't believe it was in the same room as a living legend.
I found my place here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for the local newspaper in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and in 1984 he became a TV-am Scottish reporter.
In addition, Kelly served as a host of programs such as GMTV and ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and then began to show her name.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews were broadcast.
"The passion and enthusiasm" and curiosity were the secret to survive in the television industry, and the host said, "I have to put it into work."
It must be honest and sincere.
I am interested in various people and interested in them.
Looking back on the news that he was shocked in his mind, Kelly revealed that he was "very painful" about Dunblane's shooting.
On the day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think we were killed or seen many of the injured children's families who were killed or injured.
The mother, one of the five-year-old daughter Joanna, told me personally to see me, so we talked about hours at her house.
I went to Joanna's funeral and Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry Mackan's daughter Maddenin was missing, saying that it was "very painful" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the harshness of the net that they do not know what is happening in their beloved daughter.
The couple won't really be poisoned.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine was broadcast on 8:30 on Monday, September 30.
gwenga, afraid of traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined due to anxiety that the offer of presidents from the late President Robert Mugabe might be a trap that could lead to military action in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the Defense Forces continued, and Mugabe offered the appointment of President to Chiwenga, and the last week in Zimbabwe's Indiana Pendent paper.
However, Chiwenga refused to offer because of anxiety, but it is the reason that he saw the intention of Mugabe to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of the regime in a coup.
According to a series of Twitter reports that the authorities confirmed that it was a senior official of the Cabinet Office, the Mugabe, who had been holding the government for 37 years, was willing to give the government to Chiwenga instead of Emmerson Munangagwa, and that there was a fierce negotiation at that time.
Mugabe, who noticed that he was losing power, told the government officials that he wanted to contact Chiwenga by the messenger.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late Presidents was carried out by three.
President Spokesman George Charanba, the top representative of the Central Intelligence Organization at the time, Aaron Nepela and the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonoli were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, former Governor of Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank, was the one commissioned by Mugabe, who was entrusted to the position of President to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces Chiwenga.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, failed to attempt to condemn military action against the African Union while seeking intervention by African leaders.
The offer to transfer the president's office to former CDF (the commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of former presidents.
"Some of the late president's family began to suffer fatigue, and it was a wasteful action to save the rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, at least diplomatically, the political goal of the late President was little.
If there is something that destroys the constitutional order, it would have been to conflict with the views of the African Union on the coup, but I would like to remember that the commander had declared that he would not break the constitutional order and would not break.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top of the army at the time, would trap the claims of commanders who claimed to have not defeated the constitutional order.
President Mugabe wanted the African Union to decide whether the situation should be positioned as a coup without fully grasping the whole situation, but ultimately to be considered valid, without being called a coup.
It was intended and calculated at the bottom of this offer.
When he noticed that he was not protected by the defense forces, Mugabe moved, and the authorities speak.
He was warned that he would be executed like Cadafi, and Mugabe was forced to write a resignation.
The commanders of the army told Mugabe that even if they invaded the president's house, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe wanted two of them to protect their families and prove their power by the military.
The commanders and commanders at that time read exactly their intentions.
The words told by the messenger (gono) that the President's desperate message were "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa" (which we belong to the military department), and we were used to describe a powerful metaphorical expression, "We are not in the political competition unless we are a politician."
The Army reported that through the military commanders in the region, the aim was to remove the "criminals" surrounding him, not to defeat Mugabe.
In addition, Mugabe attempted to return to South Africa with the same method to discuss coups and successors.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
The key South Africans who refused to intervene because of not only the economic power and power in the region, but also the chairman of the South African Development Community at that time, clearly stated that the South African Army would immediately be sent to Harare, as the military had repeatedly threatened behind it.
"It was not possible to realize that it was not supported by Putin and African leaders," he said.
The ratification of the treaty in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
【New York Joint】 On the 26th of the United Nations Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and the grandson of the director of Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) gave a speech by Mr. Takeuchi (63) of the Second World War, who had been bombarded during the bombing.
The new five countries ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratified it in 32 countries.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were conducted in accordance with the International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons on the 26th of the United Nations.
In recent years, Secretary-General Guttels also expressed strong concern as a move to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There's no other way to eliminate."
China needs strong leadership, and if it doesn't matter, the collapse of the policy document
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that in the White Paper, the Communist Party took over the administration 70 years ago, and the success of the party was due to the leadership.
China is wide, and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are little political problems.
Without a unified strong leadership, China would go to division and collapse and become a catastrophe for the world."
As the Chinese authorities needed for national stability, they have long been justified to address problems in a robust manner, such as the suppression of democratization movement that occurred in Beijing in 1989.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, the leader of the world's second largest economic power commemorative ceremony, held the government in late 2012.
He also directed the modernization of the military that threatened the region.
China does not intend to export its own model of development, and does not intend to incorporate the model of other countries, but merely to seek peace, rather than agonism.
Some Chinese genes have no other national invasion or world control.
In modern times, China has been bullied from column strength and war and chaos left deep scars with its pain; China will never be able to harm other people who have experienced pain.
China welcomes the anniversary of a severe trade war with the United States, and faces difficulties such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in Hong Kong, China.
It is said that China will never abandon its core interests and will not allow security and sovereignty to be lost.
"There is no problem with any tariffs that continue to rise with the threat of trade war."
China is a mature economic nation with a complete industrial system, complete industrial chain, wide market space and strong economic development momentum.
"We will never weaken the trade war."
I am confident that China is facing difficulties and has the ability to transform crisis into opportunities and open a new world.
Since China has no idea to counter the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., the United States should calmly grasp the development of China.
The U.S. can't control China and stop the development of China.
If you want to suppress and suppress other countries, and move to foreign countries, the United States will not maintain strength.

After the Spice Girls' MelC, a diet disorder, a diet topic is prohibited in families.
The Spice Girls' Melannie Chizom, who had been aware of the prohibition of diet in their homes, from the experience of the struggle of eating no fruit and vegetables for many years.
The sporty spices, under pressure from members of the world's pop group, have continued to exercise excessively without eating enough for many years, have been diagnosed with depression and diet disorder.
Chizom told her that her experience was influenced by her mother's children's children's children, stating that "No topic about diet in the family is prohibited."

The same sex marriage justice judgment: Hokkaido Shimbun
In the case of a conflict between marriage and marriage, Saneoka Branch of Utsunomiya City judged this.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize the same marriage, and there is no legal effect in the country.
Based on this, the ruling was approved by two women in fact.
It is considered the first judicial decision to have legal protection for couples.
As a result of the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Register Act, a lawsuit against the country's compensation is conducted in five jurisdictions such as Sapporo.
In order to overcome the judgment, I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system that recognizes diverse families.
Females lived in the United States for about seven years and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The ruling was recognized as "the reality of marriage between men and women" due to the achievements of two living beings.
It is a revolutionary decision to spread the recognition of marriages that have rights to marriage, including social insurance.
In addition, it is important to note that the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution that the marriage is "only based on mutual agreement."
It is said that both sex and marriages were not expected at the time of the establishment, and it was not possible to deny marriage.
While the Constitution does not assume the same marriage, it is hoped that it would be a driving force for the same-sex marriage lawsuits throughout the country.
On the other hand, due to the lack of sexual marriage, "the benefit of legal protection between men and women" remained unchanged.
While recognizing the same situation as between men and women, it is not possible to distinguish the rights to protect them.
In the study of national home trends for married women, about 70% of people who were supposed to be recognized by the law have changed their consciousness.
While lifestyle diversification continues, the law is bound by traditional family statues, and it is to take away the rights of people who do not fit it.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" who admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as lack of tax benefits and lack of joint custody.
In consideration of the same sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from various viewpoints, such as not only marriage between sex, but also increasing legal rights for marriage.

it's a serious pollution of popular tourist spots, and it's obviously a video.
Among Sydney's tourist resources, Sydney Harbour is the largest producer of opera houses, Sarcler Keys, Luna Park, and the famous Harbour Bridge, which will bring $200 million annually to Australia's economy.
But under the bridge there is a ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of the worst canals in Australia, where about 15 cup of contaminants flow every year.
Thanks to this fearful statistics, one of our biggest tourist destinations is one of the most dirty places.
According to the new video of the title, from Sydney Harbor to the bottom of the waterway around the most popular city in Australia, there are many mussels, plastic bags, pet bottles, shoes, clothes, and even animal dead bodies - all flows into Sydney Harbor by rainwater flowing on the road.
Among them, the biggest factor to break the waterway is plastic.
Dr. Catherine Da Fortune, Vice President of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said "This is a paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but it is one of the most modified and contaminated mouths of Japan's coastline.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterway, most of which flow into Sydney Harbor via rainwater drainage.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but after that, Sydney Harbor was pretty tragic," Dr. David.
Two-thirds of the pollution flow from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
But it is like a corner of the iceberg, and 70 percent of plastics flowing into the ocean are stored in the sea floor.
"I really don't know what's going on under the sea level, but I don't know what the truth is there."
If you know more (what is there under the water surface) many people, I think everyone is really doing it.
It's overwhelming, but more than half of the items we discover are plastic bags.
The remaining half is used at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbor is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone who knows that all plastics and garbage flows under the water.
Mr. Jeremy Brown, one of the founders of Ocean Protecht, told the locals that they could be able to reduce plastics and waste flowing into the waterways.
you should start from the source of origin.
By reducing the use of plastics, recycling more well, and finally flowing into the sea, we need to be more conscious about what is flowing into the water mouth.
50 percent of oxygen that we suck will come from the ocean, so we will kill ourselves.
Oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
But we will repair Sydney Harbor and return to the old appearance, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing humans.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also announced in this month, as part of the activities that the Australian public understands the environmental protection and the reduction of the effects of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new survey, about 546 children from 12 to 18 years old, 82 percent had a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste problem is an adult.
In addition, the study also pointed out that the problem of plastic waste was ranked fourth in concern for parents and 93 percent of respondents surveyed, felt increasingly anxious about the amount of plastic waste in the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change, and that led to eco-friendly anxiety.

it's a key thing to do with cancer treatment.
Tusmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells would be.
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmaniadeville and humans.
In this discovery, we expect a new way to treat cancer patients.
What is the common relationship between Tasmania and humans?
It is a cancer cell that cannot be seen.
The team, including researchers at Peter McClellon Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there is a cancer that does not respond to immunotherapy, it could significantly change the treatment of cancer.
It may have been the key to tackling a highly deadly face tumor that threatens the future of the Tusmaniadeville near extinction.
In this study, some cancer cells in humans and bags used a series of proteins called PRC2 to cause markers to be reacted and immune systems could not attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and Melkel cells.
Prof. Mark Doson, a researcher at Peter McCarlum, said, "The very important thing in this project is that we might be able to reverse the process for patients who have shown resistance to immunotherapy."
The immune system may be able to reuse conventional therapies and activate proteins known as MHC again, and identify cancer cells.
"There may be considerable impact on patients with lung cancer," Dr. Doson said.
"The lung cancer is an epidemic in the world.
And it may be possible to treat in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery ultimately to be used in the treatment of the face-to-face tumor of Tasmaniadeville, where cancer cells escape detection.
"It's amazing that the same process will happen at all (for humans and Tasmanian de Villegan) ."
"It was very hard to treat Tusmaniadeville tumor.
However, if drugs that are effective for humans can be used in Tasmaniadeville, it may be possible to help control the tumor."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting stars.
Scientists discover the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation, which orbits a giant Jupiter-shaped planet around a small star called a red dwarf, in a distance of 30 light years from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of a giant gas planet GJ3512b was released around the red dwarf star.
The stars are usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, there is no difference in the size of stars and planets, and researchers told Thursday.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"That's another surprise," said Juan Carlos Molales, an astronomical physicist at the Catalan Space Institute at the Institute of Space Science, Spain.
The theoretical model shows that normally low mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gases like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Spanish Color Alto Observatory.
The planet takes about 204 days to draw an elliptical orbit around the star.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
GJ3512 is not only much smaller than our Sun, but also the same size as the giant planet, which is about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, the surface temperature is much lower than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 (degree).
So it's a red color."
On the other hand, while the second planet orbits the star, the third planet may have been released from its star system in the past, Molales explained the elliptic orbit of Jupiter-type planets.
Planets are generated from the same disk consisting of stars that generate orbiting stars.
In the most powerful planetary formation model known as the "core integration" model, the object is generated from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes atmosphere by pulling the eggs of the planet.
A conflict model called a self-gravity unstable model may explain this rare planetary system.
"In this case, the primitive planetary disk surrounding the stars that were born may be slightly larger and lower temperatures than they thought."
Because disks become unstable in this state, some dense areas may appear.
These masses may grow until they collapse and form planets.
i'm going to take care of my colleagues to eat a soy-dipp with a delicate employee and a wakeer.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is accused of eating dipps of beans with awakening agents.
On Thursday, Albany's Cassandra Animina Hernández (38) was charged with suspicion that the transfer of methane fertamine, which was a B-grade sin, and the use of regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident occurred on 9 September at Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County.
According to the estimates of the oaths obtained from OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to delicately for lunch and asked Medicina Hernandes to taste a little, so he asked him to take a look at it.
According to the statement of the oath, the victim told the agent that he had never done methane phenamine before, "I thought it would be strange, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, the stomach was getting worse and the legs fell.
According to Albanney Democrat Herald, a local hospital where women visited was judged to have been involved in methane fertamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee told me that Medina Hernandes had told the victim's food to "behind the drug," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message that methane fetamine was accidentally put into the beans dip.
According to the Oregon Live article, it is said that the surveillance video captured by the delicates is captured by Medina Hernández in the back of the microwave, but something is taken out of the brager.
After that, it is said to have been standing up and wipe the nose and put the beans dip into a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were put on the dish.
According to the Oregon Stateman Journal, the sheriff said that there was no idea that there were customers who had been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was imprisoned in Marion County instead of $52 million.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernandes has a history of assault, robbery, transfer of methane fetamin, theft, possession of methane fertamine, and possession of control weapons.

Michele Obama, instagram, praised megan markel as inspiration.
Michele Obama praised Magan Markle on Thursdays, favorable instagrams, and called the wife of the Duke of Sasex to break the type and become a more conscious leader in the world.
During his 10-day visit to South Africa with his son Arche Harrison Mountbatten-Winzer, he attended the reception of young people and met with the executives of the Obama Foundation.
Former President, Mrs. former President, wrote a very positive post: "The old custom is defeated, the thoughtful leader who makes the world better, my friend, Princess Sassex, thank you.
Mrs. Obama wrote a photo of Mrs. Magan, who poses with the executive of the Foundation, and added that "Even if the meeting with the Obama Foundation executives, the support of girls around the world who seek appropriate education, it will inspire many people."
Her former actress, Magan, served as guest editor in the September issue of the British edition Vogue magazine, and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In a direct conversation, former President Mrs. Motonaga noted how his mother and mother changed himself.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "My mother is something like being in an advanced class to let go."
My job was almost always as my mother, who always learned that children will find themselves who want to grow.
In essence, they find who they are themselves, not the ideals for children as parents and their childhood aspirations.
In fact, Obama's wife, who actually knows the pressure on spot lights in the world, advised her little by little by little while at the Interview of Good Housekeeping magazine.
Sometimes, there are times when the pressure from themselves and people around you can feel too large.
That's why I'm the most important advice to do things over time.

Trump Hotel owner's complaints, liquor sales license is retained.
Washington (AP) - The Court of Justice of the State of Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the permission of the local Trump International Hotel to sell alcohol.
The committee filed a complaint with three members, two former judges, two Jewish leaders, and most of the petitioners were not living in Washington State or had fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, in accordance with the State Law, which requires the applicant's "suitability" to obtain the license for the sale of alcohol, the appeal to cancel the right of the Hotel's alcohol provision is twice.
In the first appeal submitted in the summer of last year, he repeatedly accused President Trump's assault and claimed that he violated the state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the license was already accepted.
This was the second time the petition was issued to update the license.
The honey bees collected by Bent trays are the first harvest!
How about the taste of honey collected by the FlyingBees who are bred in the knee of the FlyingB?
In May 2019, the British Bent tray's crew factory was opened, and the first honey bees were harvested in September.
More than 100 bottles of honeybees were collected from only two nest boxes.
Why did Bent tray become a beekeeper at the factory where cars were assembled?
I want to taste this!
Here are the honeys that Bent tray works.
Peter Bosh, director of the manufacturing department of Bent tray, commented as follows.
"The aim of contributing to the conservation of biodiversity in the region was to establish a nest for the first time in the vast premises of the crew factory this year.
From the wildflowers planted on the site and the mountains surrounding the area, the beekeepers have been watching how honey bees have gathered.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeepers, and it is wonderful to have so much harvest in the first year.
Through the crew and our business, Bent tray has been engaged in a wide range of activities as much as possible as possible as possible at the top of the Sastenable luxury car manufacturers.
The staff actively cooperated.
It is very nice to have the first harvest successfully, and next year we will establish more nests and plan to increase the amount of harvest of beers.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to work on various initiatives to play our own role."In May 2019, 12 million honeybees began to beekeepers.
In September of the same year, after the summer of the same year, the work was completed to remove the nest from the nest box, and the nests were cut into a centrifugal compartment and filtered the bees that fell apart.
You can also see the bottle and package of honey.
The design of the label was directed by the designer Louise Mac column, who is responsible for the interior of the vendor.
The bottled honey is not only delivered to the staff but also gifts to customers and customers who visit the crew factory.

The Cleveland Police reported fraud in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continued to deteriorate, and the police officer Phil Gomley said.
In six years, police officers were replaced by five police officers, and now they are facing voices seeking new demolition.
According to the report, he was forced to stop crime and arrest suspects and to prevent social weakness.
Phil Gomley, the police director, said, "We've been so serious since we finally investigated it."
The police officer Mike Vill resigned in January, less than a year after his appointment, but he was "a serious" about his actions, but had been investigated for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was arrested after being arrested for serious illegal acts.
Captain Simon Harwood, who was in charge of sexual activity last year, went to an illegal investigation committee due to his involvement in his colleagues.
He resigned from the police.
Mayor Ben Howin of the Conservative Party said: "This is officially verified by the police collapse.
This is when the Ministry of Interior intervenes."
Richard Lewis, Chief of the Police Department said, "We have been improving, but we are all responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Peloci: William Bar was a "criminal" and the impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what's going on.
At present, we believe that we are involved in a cover-up incident and may take some time to investigate."
"I'm going to do my job based on the time to find facts and facts."
In the White House records published this week, Trump found that he asked President Warrodimir Zellensky of Ukraine to ask Vice President Joe Biden and his son's investigation.
According to a call record, Trump also found that he requested Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Ludi Juliani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine before more than a week of formal inquiry, and reported on Thursday.
The Court of Justice accused Trump's telephone meeting as a reference to the information agency concerned, and judged that Trump's telephone talks were not subject to political investigation.
In response to the question that Mr. Bar should testify, Mr. Peroci said on Friday that he decided to ask anyone to witness.
However, Mr. Peroci added that he thinks he became a criminal.
Certainly, the bar was pretty early.
He said, "Because the name of the bar was chosen from the end," he touched on Trump's name on a telephone meeting with the President of Ukraine in July.
It's interesting that Mr. Bar would be forced to judge about this accusation.
Mr. Peroci said that Trump attacked the accusations on Thursday as a spy on Thursday, and he was very concerned that he had been treated differently in the past.
President's statement is too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Peroci said that the internal accusations play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president has said nothing to do about the person who could provide information to the internal charges," he said.
On Tuesday, Mr. Peroci announced that he would formally impeachment the Trump clan, and wrote a historical step.
The call was included in the charges issued on Thursday, and the internal charges claimed that Trump had abused his job to seek intervention in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The internal prosecution also claimed that the White House's advisors ordered officials to remove calls from a cabinet-level computer system and replace them with a special confidential system.

Ghana: Mr. Cofi Manuel and the Board of Reviews
Cofi Manuel, a football-administ and executive of Secondi Hasacus, expressed concern about the composition of the next Ghana Football Association (GFA).
He questioned whether he would include Frank Davisis, and expressed his frustration.
In the interview with GNA sports, Mr. Manuel said that the chairman had interests in the results of the screening process, and that the chairman included the chairman was fair or questionable.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair neutral member from the outside without prior interest, whether or not each member has a relationship.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Parma about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, he argued that he had an interest in him, and his commission should not be allowed.
On the other hand, Mr. Manuel suggested that if he attended the Committee of the Olympic Committee, Fred Papoe said that his relationship with the club would cause a conflict of interest in the chairman's side.
The members of the committee were scheduled to start activities yesterday and end on October 4.
The chairman was Frank Davis, a corporate governance consultant, and a member was a lawyer, Marian Barano and Emmanuel Darker.
Other members include the Reginald Ralliair, a marketing and sales officer, and the lawyer Richard Akpocavi.
The survey found that 54.2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture think that the minimum wage increase target for the country's minimum wage hike was "good for minimum wage thousand yen."
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies that were expected to be "responsible" was around 50% of new graduates and mid-term employees.
Companies who answered "approved" to raise 1,000 yen were information-related (100 percent) and construction (70,6 percent) and wholesale (61,7 percent).
The majority of the respondents were manufacturing (51,9 percent) and services including food and drink (60,9 percent) and accommodation.
The representative of the conference said, "There is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in parts and time-consuming industries, but it is difficult to secure human resources, and there are many companies that think that labor costs increase.
The average amount of money was 895 yen (from 4 October Fukui Prefecture to 829 yen).
When I heard about the adoption of a new employee in March 19th, the hiring of a new employee was 61,3 percent, and the mid-term adoption was 54.5%, and non-regular employment was conducted by 154%.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure was 44,7 percent, 50,3 percent, and non-regulars remained 311%.
In particular, the transportation industry (new graduates 13,3 percent, 37,5 percent) and construction work (new graduates 24,1 percent) were struggling.
Overall, 86 percent of the total population had problems in hiring, and in many cases, the number of applicants was lower than the number of applicants."
As a result of the adoption of the government, there were many voices asking for the promotion and provision of information for the introduction of new graduates (in three years after graduation).
In addition to providing PR opportunities to students from outside of the prefecture and supporting various internships, there was also a opinion that they wanted to boost their approach to students.
On the other hand, 15.3% of the country's sub-business and business proposed by the growth strategy said, "I already admit."
A third of the total three-thirds of the total, including 20 and 3% of the plan to acknowledge the future.
Companies that do not recognize were 644%, with the construction industry (82.8 percent) and retail (73.1%) and manufacturing (72,7 percent).
The survey took place between July 19 and August 2, with 1,000 members.
298 (29.8%) answered.

The voice of Tiprick before the battle against the wealthy.
"I'm going to show you now," said Justin Tiprick, in the event that Wales will meet the World Cup Tennoyama and Australia to determine the future tournament.
If Wales won the Walladads, it would be the most hot winner of the pool D, perhaps the semifinals against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia has won the 14th victory against Wales, Tiprick and the team will be one straight line between England and England.
"It's natural, I want to challenge both teams and end up winning the group top."
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win in the autumn of last year.
I think Australia will take a lot of blame to repay the loan, but it's until I try to win it again.
Before I came here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I came here now, and now it was a real show.
Wales has won only one win in the previous World Cup, both Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and the victory to Wala beads was 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gattland, all three teams in the Southern Hemisphere were scored in 41 battles.
Wales stopped at 13 November Test Match Australia's defeat, but Tiprick included a number of representative members who won the match 9-6 and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium on this Sunday.
He said, "It's hard to answer."
Certainly it was a match, and maybe I thought that everyone would win, but I don't know well.
As a result, I was sure about 15 points in the final match, so I seemed to have been more than a score."
In order to win Wales, a combination of Australia, which is worshiped as Buck Lo, Michael Hoper and David Pocock, and a breakdown battle with Tiprick is key.
In the past, Tiprick has experienced 67 international matches and has been fighting for several matches and players in the past and knows what is waiting.
"They are definitely a world-class backs player," he says.
When you fight the world glass backrow, you always know that you're going to face a tough match.
They are always the world's highest level.
So I know what kind of game will be.
While Pocock is one of the world's most defensive battles, Michael may know more about rugby in terms of having to go properly to the desired location.
I want to increase myself by fighting with the best players in the world.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against the two, then you have to do well.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important match for us.
the momentum is important.
If you continue to build a good performance, you will be able to play without losing the momentum.

Do you regret this hot moment?

tonight, Whitney, but better feel better than before you go and back from vacation.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo comes with '90 percent of Gala', it's true to be a gift from a performer.
It is a series of issues of Yoshimoto Kogyo, which caused the dark sales of antisocial forces, and the problems surrounding Galla are closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto at the meeting on July 22, saying that "the company does not have any talent in 9 or anything like that," the average is "5:5 to 6:4," but the performers resist.
If the ratio of "9:1" is 90 percent, the view of investors who are considered to have a gift to Yoshimoto from performers and that taxes are paid is also streamed on Twitter, with more than 30,000 retweets.
If Galla's withdrawal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was told by Yukinori Ando.
In the first place, the corporation is not subject to a donation tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual, it is not the subject of the donation tax.
If the amount of work for 100 million yen was "9:1," Yoshimoto Kogyo will benefit from ¥100 million in sales and ¥10 million in expenses.
This is the subject of corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax declarations and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you think about the allocation, you don't have to say that the amount you have actually received is different from the amount you should receive.
And I think the amount I received will be declared as sales.
The gift shall not be given as an individual if the other person is not aware of it, as the gift says, "I will give you a circle and receive it."
If the price is clearly priced (e.g. the sale of real estates, etc.) is traded at a price away from the original rate for tax avoidance, it is a problem to calculate taxes.
However, as this time, the third party will not decide whether the tax price is appropriate for both parties to deal with without conflict.
Personally, I think that one yen payment book is a poison.
After graduating from university, he worked as a bank, and after graduating from university, he registered a tax accountant in 2008.
A wide range of activities such as university lecturers, seminars and writing.
It is well known for easy-to-understand explanations for beginners.
the White House, the impeachment of the impeachment, the big panic.
The White House officials said that Thursday, the new Democratic Party's impeachment pressure would be a leap, and the details of this issue were that there was no plans to deal with the newly emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the appeal of internal accusations on the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have been increasing in concern, anxiety and anxiety about the possibility that the President and some peripherals damage.
He said, "I don't know what's happening."
The White House officials joked that there was no obvious plan on this situation, and as the president could not apply the usual measures that had been successfully involved in the matter, this claim was very serious, so there was no confidence in how to proceed, "It seems that the next news will be erased."
Another person who was familiar with this controversy expressed the atmosphere in the White House, which was increasing in the sense of alertness, as the president responded to the impeachment of the impeachment, and the possibility that the President would "not be in the hands."
Another concern is that the pressure of the President is expected to be raised daily, while the pressure of the President is being questioned by the impeachment.
Trump's attention to the increasingly unpredictable behavior and the possibility of a violent attack on unexpected means and is concerned about President and politics in the environment of the election year.
Trump faced the greatest threats that had never been before in the presidential term, and had changed his position to attack or becoming a defense party, such as restoring the strategy that Robert Morler had judged himself effective during the Russian investigation.
Trump tried to lighten his request to the Ukrainian President, who wanted to cooperate with the investigation of the political enemy, and was interested in the activities of the Democratic Party and Joe Biden presidential candidate, and attempted to undermine the credit of the internal charges as the motive of a factional confrontation.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the trials of Moler's investigation, but this time they began to feel the difference, and their close friends said.
Although he was a brand president, he seemed to have been in the press conference on Wednesday.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but it seems that he didn't answer questions about Ukraine.
There is a person who knows the fact that President Trump and Vorozimir Zellensky, who had no direct information of calls with the President of Ukraine, were aware of the fact that it would undermine the credibility of the internal accusations, and some of them are convinced that damage can be reduced.
Furthermore, it is often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of the support layer increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic house close to the White House pointed out that the basic support rate of the president is already very high and the effect of obtaining new supporters by impeachment is not too much.
In particular, if the impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at 4-6 o'clock, there is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the President for the next four months.
Others claimed that the impeachment could help the President fully understand how much the President's response would be.
White House officials who are concerned are seeking advice to the advisors to organize an impeachment team.
According to officials who explained the bones of this plan, this initiative is still in the early stage, but it is still unclear whether or not it will be implemented in any form, such as a strategic decision room.
However, it is said that this person is aware that the publication of organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, and the publication of critical internal prosecution documents and the publication of the public statement must be a clear leader who can effectively organize public relations activities in order to counter the momentum imposed by the Democratic Party's impeachment.
According to more information about this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspective seems to be clearly visible, such as the lack of long-term strategic viewpoints, such as the lack of long-term strategic viewpoints, as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeeo and the Secretary of Finance stated that Trump would not publish notes on calls with the Ukrainian President of Trump.
According to the person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the implementation of impeachment is called the outside pitble of Trump, who was the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwandouski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would become a leader in such efforts.
"I came here for five years to support the president and policy, but I didn't talk with the president or close friends about participating in the team to counteract this false impeachment."
Trump's external attorney, Jay Se Crow, is also involved in the efforts of impeachment.
In response to NBC news coverage, Se Crow replied that "the problem is properly processed."
At the end of the investigation, Emet Fladd left the White House, teaching the White House until the end of Morler's investigation, and the current White House legal advisor Pat Sipolon has little experience, and the White House currently lacks lawyers with experience of impeachment.
More information about the White House's strategy is generally far away from the establishment of personnel invitations and strategic measures teams, but it is understood that all parties need to be organized and able to lead human resources who can lead the total effort and political struggle.

Long distance romance needs to be prepared only 16% Morikawa Tomoyoshi - Yahoo! News
9/6 (Fri) 13:51
When I got a boyfriend, I had a long distance love for his job ...
I was told to marry someday, but I couldn't see the goal.
When that happens, how can we connect to marriage with friends?
I heard a solution to Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa, who gave lectures on romance at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa, who is guided by detailed data analysis, is required to read.
this is my concern.
I am worried that I should continue my relationship with my boyfriend in a distant romance.
I continued to live in Kansai, where my workplace and my family lived.
As a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future.
what should i do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office).
A couple who came to marry from distant love
C is in love with a boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also a word "the distance is tested and the two will become stronger," but in the first place, the long distance romance will work?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter Morikawa) A survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered, but according to the data, only 16% of the couples who were able to marry from distant love.
Since love is done using five senses, it is originally a relationship with watching the opponent (visual), listening to voice, connecting hands (touching), smelling odors, and kissing.
However, in the case of long distance romance, there are cases where you hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to continue working with only hearing conditions.
There is also a problem of cost.
If you go to the opponent's house, you will be burdened on transportation costs, time and effort, and holiday to heal the fatigue of your work.
When I return home, I feel comfortable.
Is it possible to break away?
Morikawa If you are a couple who can endure without frequent meetings or a couple who are determined in advance, I think it will work.
I'm going to come back after two years of engagement.
It may be difficult if you don't see the future position.

Devin Nunes, the Democratic Party of Trump's Nodo photo, condemns the Democratic Party.
Devin Nunes, a member of the California Republican Party, seems to be unable to bear the idea that Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, he condemned the Democratic Party to attempt to obtain the President's nude photo in a comment to defend the president.
Members of the House of Representatives General Nenes, the Republican Party of the House of Representatives, filed a statement at the beginning of a trial on internal charges that Trump requested to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The Congress condemned the Democratic Party, saying that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left and its media assets, and that he would like to see the full naked picture of the president.
"The Democratic Party of this special committee negotiated with the Ukrainians who were likely to receive Trump's nude photos."
Why is the Democratic Party so exciting to impeach the president?It's natural to ask everyone for that opportunity within a year.
After the disproportionate of the Nances, the press on the Huff post, Jennifer Bend Delhi, decided to determine whether the Democratic Party would seek the truth.
The response was only to the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, but also to many other members, it was doubtful whether the answer was a red naked truth.
Medicare Dotcom speculates that Nudyst's comments may be related to "more unidentified details" that were written in steel documents that were discussed.
It is a notorious report that former British intelligence officer Christopher Steel collected a shocking claim against Trump, and in one of the hotels in Moscow, it is said that Trump is reflected in the air urination of prostitutes and suggests that there is a "hot tape."

in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles and Tesla trucks and semis have monopolized the news, it is the only flight to fly in the sky, and it is not possible to obtain renewable energy.
However, the University of Alberta developed technologies that allow renewable biofuels to be used as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bressler, professor at the Department of Agriculture, Alberta, started the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops carbonated hydrogen fuel from lipid waste such as oil fat, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low-quality fats to produce, and carbon emissions are less than 85% higher than crude oil-based fuel.
This technique also acts as a reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuel.
Dr. Bresler said, "This technology achieved by the first generation is a hydrocarbon in the molecule itself in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option for use of biofuels, conventional biofueling techniques tend to be unstable at low temperatures, causing serious problems to travel high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is something like dilemmas," Dr. Bresler said.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory focuses on two options as fuel for jet fuel.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires another treatment of hydrocarbon fuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue research on chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try the reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is high risk.
As airlines and Canada and the U.S. Army have invested in renewable options, Forbes, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on productization.
"They predicted that someday someone would impose carbon taxes in the future."
I want to prepare a plan for the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $500 million from Lockheed Martin to 400 million US$ in support of building a production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 1900 million litter biofuels annually.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but it is the reason that the fuel transport method and production methods do not reduce the rate.
"As a technical store," he says.
My job is to create an option to make multiple choices parallel with the decision taken by the explanation.

Boris Johnson's camp warns that Britain faces riots like Los Angeles, and Prime Minister calls for calmness.
If the second referendum would cover the first outcome, there was a danger that "the violent riots caused by the people" would occur in this country, and the senior minister said last night.
The Prime Minister's senior officials warned the British would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the riots of citizens of the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
Johnson stated that he had to "response anger" against a violent political word, but he argued that he would not stop using the word "default."
Despite the appeal of Prime Minister to regain his calmness, some Ministers said in the Times: "In this country, it never happened like Gire Joene or Los Angeles riots in 1992.
People don't think that there is no riot in this country just because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best movement, they're encrypting their mobile phone and organizing demos, and after all, the leader of the populist who's trying to scare people using dirty hands is a few.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when four white policemen, who were beaten by a black taxi driver Rodney King, told the jury guilty of innocence.
In this year, the French anti-government protester Zile Joene, wearing the yellow best, has caused confusion and destruction in Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers noted the warning of Johnson in the House of Representatives and stated that if the United Kingdom failed to withdraw the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be catastrophic.
"If the referendum voted for 30 million people and 66% of the vote to stay in the EU, this Ministers said, "I think the 100 million people are unhappy."
Even if the 99 percent of voters opposed their withdrawal, they would not give up by writing letters to the House of Representatives.
It's not time for thousands of people to repeat.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum would cover the first outcome, there would be a danger that the violent riots in the country would occur.
Johnson wants to take the general election and leave the decision of Brexit to voters.
Johnson reported that he was facing a rebellion in the House of Representatives seeking to lower the demands for the withdrawal of the EU and instead beat the EU with compromises.

exposure to large amounts of pesticides and the risk of heart disease and heart attack
When working around a high concentration of pesticides, it has been shown that the risk of heart disease may be higher.
This is the result of a tracking survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared with a group of men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, writing on medical records that contain pesticide exposure in work, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease."
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of senior medical care at the University of Hawaii in Manano.
This is the result of the study of data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu, who participated in the Kiakini Honolulu Heart Program.
This study is aimed at only Japanese Americans, so researchers may not apply to women or other races.
Because pesticides have a long period of decline, health impacts may appear after years after exposure.
The study showed the greatest impact within ten years after exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important."
This is probably because the importance of other factors associated with aging population increases and hides possible relationships between pesticides and mental diseases in the last years.
Researchers found that exposure to pesticides in low and middle concentrations, heart disease, and no significant relevance to heart attack.
Zellensky Trump's telephone meeting with Polochenko intervention
Donald Trump's U.S. President's impeachment procedure was made, and the Washington political issue was a devastating week.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners Vogelmi Zellensky.
But what has happened to Zellensky Trump's phone problem?
At the beginning of the telephone meeting, Trump said that the U.S. is more convenient than other European countries.
Although the call recorded by the White House is not repeated, it is described in detail that Trump was critical that the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders were dedicated to speaking more about concrete proposals.
The response of Zellensky, who opposed Trump's 100 percent more than 100%, is disputed.
Zellensky added that both the President and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties disputed social media.
President Petro Poloschenko wrote on Twitter that "there is no precedent for support received from the EU."
In addition, Polochenko tweeted that he was grateful to support EU sanctions and economic assistance during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Votiica, said, "Is it possible to negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Following Trump's request for military aid, the first is to ask Zellensky to take two surveys, not one, but to the Hunter of Joe Biden's son, and the second suggests that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic Party's e-mail invasion during the 2016 election and investigates the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee.
It is uncertain whether this would hinder European relations, or whether the French and German leaders would put their backwaters.
I don't want anyone to say bad things.
When the call was announced, Zellensky thanked the people who supported it."
Zellensky will be meeting with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.

Captain Cano said he had previously been engaged in drug investigation, and that in the process of extracting oil used for Bayp products could be a fire.
"It is possible to fire only static electricity from clothes, so it will cause fire as well as explosions."
In addition, if there are multiple containers, it could not only explode one after another, but also burn the entire building.
A dangerous unit was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of goods and equipment seized were not immediately published.
He received an anonymous information and told the investigators that it led to the investigation of the site where it discovered illegal activities.
The investigators are still pursuing who is the black curtain of illegal Bayp activities.
The police said that the office was empty, so he thought he had a store in the office.

Captain Cano said, "It's a substitute for anyone who is truly authentic or not buying."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have caused great harm to our communities and children, so the police always warn people to prevent such activities.

Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I
It was woven with silver foil yarns made of high-quality camlet silk, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, beasts, butterflies were much more.
Hessrick Royal Palace dress collection curator, Eleanor Lin, refused to be one.
The fallen piece of cloth, which was put on the wall of a small church in the countryside, was placed there a hundred years ago, and was considered part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth I's clothing dance.
After three years after the discovery of this luxurious cloth, which was used as the altarpiece of the church in Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited near that room, which could be worn over 450 years ago by Queen Tudor.
Another thing that remains in the dress of the 16th century is that it was an important discovery in the entire Royal dress collection.
Although Elizabeth did not have the perfect evidence of the dress through sleeves, he was convinced that the dress was not a town of royal possession for three years.
Although the law was prepared only by senior members of the royal family, it suggests that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later was a noble person.
At the time the dress was made, it seems that the price was equivalent to one house of the Tudor family.
Furthermore, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabeth dynasty, it is speculated that the Queen would be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rivals who wear such luxury clothing could not endure.
Mr. Lin said he was very important to publish, so he came to see his colleagues.
When everyone looked at the cloth, I was always happy to hear "great" and I was convinced that I was watching one of the Royal Dresses."
The long second life of a dress that was used as an altar cloth of the Holy Face Church of Canbaton, cut off, and not as unexpected.
Burkton is a village from Bransh Parley, who served as a female officer throughout the long life of Queen Elizabeth, who is said to have been associated with Paley for a long time.
The dress is after 1590, when Patley died, but the experts believe that it must have been brought to the family or church before Elizabeth died in 1603.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles will be exhibited next to the " rainbow portrait" depicting Elizabeth wearing similar dresses, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition period.
The vast space as much as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries was only a greenhouse that was renovated on Hampton Court grounds, and the preservation work was done here, and Libby Thompson said, "I feel really respect for the craftsmanship of the craftsmen who made it."
Looking at the embroidered embroidery behind the table, it is a great respect for those who made this.
I never saw this sophisticated work before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition is held from 12 October at Hampton Court Palace.
A week after the missing woman's request, the Self-Defense Force withdrew and the volunteer men were missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It's a week since the first year of elementary school girls are missing in the campground in Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces still had no clues and the Self-Defense Forces withdrew their search on 28 days.
The search for the first week in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture began at 6 o'clock in the morning with about 240 police and SDF systems.
However, the village requested to withdraw from the Self-Defense Forces to search for the requested range, and the search for the SDF ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Force launched a total of 650 people, centering on the high risk areas such as mountain slopes and Sawa, but could not catch clues.
Also, on 27th, the 20th generation of men who participated in the search of volunteers disappeared, and the search was not found.
The police and firefighting policies continue to search from 6:30 AM on 29th.
The first oral statement, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral statement of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka Takanori Miyazaki Branch, as the election was held in July this year as a violation of the Constitution.
In the case of appeal, the plaintiffs complained that the value of one vote was 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture, and 0.48 votes in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to the number of voters per member in July this year.
In the first oral theory of 27 days in the Takamasa Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka Prefecture, the plaintiff claimed that "the value of one person was inequality and wrong."
On the other hand, the prefectural election committee on the defendants asked for a claim to be dismissed as "not even if there was a significant inequality in which the issue of wrong law could arise, but it should be consolved."
The judgment is passed on 30 October.
The meeting was held by representatives.

Get caught with a robot arm | Shizuoka Shimbun
No. 8 unmanned supply aircraft arrived at the International Space Station.
From the bottom left, the robot arm of the station is growing.
JAXA staff members of the International Space Station (JAXA) who successfully catch the 8th station, and applauded.
The Space Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) which carries supplies to the International Space Station on an altitude of about 400 km (400 km) (JAXA) arrived at the station on the night of 28th, and the astronauts during their stay were able to manipulate the robot arm.
The aircraft was launched 25 days from the Seed Island Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced in control of the JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, it does not have a speed difference and approaches to about 10 meters.
The robot arm of the length of 176m is a flow that captures the supplies.
There are about 5 and 3 tons of supplies.
After installing the station, the flight attendants carry luggage.
Mexican drug cartel executives, one third of the U.S. domestic drugs
Shortly after the sunrise of Chicago Westside, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Control Bureau (DEA) revealed what was happening in the daytime.
Over 800 people died in Chicago last year.
McNight said that the drug " probably 90%" was brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named El Mencho, Nemecio Servantes.
"Mencho is one of the top priorities of the federal law enforcement agencies in Mexico," said Matthew DonahDEA, executive officer in Mexico.
El Mencho won the prize for $1,000.
With the help of Donahh, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were violent.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisko Nueva, is involved in at least one third of drugs that are brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the same cartel sold a large amount of cocaine, methane fertamine, and fertilyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's neck is worth $1 million.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California for 30 years, but was arrested for drug trafficking and returned to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel.
He owns a large amount of weapons, crewed rockets, and 50 calibers.
In fact, he said that he owned his own special mobility team.
From the death of six Mexican Army helicopters, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders occurred due to drug trafficking.
According to statistics from the Mexican government, about 94 murders occurred on a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drugs are toxic, so they must wear protective clothes during handling.
In the manufacturing center, the seal of the dealer is pressed in the bag of cocaine.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho drugs.
Donahh said, "Mencho is involved in the influx of harmful substances that have virtually stolen women and children's lives."
In other words, when someone's child died, he said, "It's likely to be a drug brought from El Mencho's organization."
Over 67,000 Americans died last year.

Children who write books at the Corela " arc" seminar - 28th, Osaka City, Japan
The Teno-ji Zoo (Tenno-ji Ward, Osaka City) opened on 28th, and was the only one in Osaka Prefecture to receive the " arc" of the male core.
In mid-October, it was decided to rent a 10-year loan to the British zoo, which is likely not returned.
thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of the core building, which was rich in eucalytic.
He was 12 years old.
The life expectancy of core las is 15 to 20 years, and it is believed to be full of Tenju in the UK, where he was married to a husband.
Mr. Eiki Tsujimoto (40) was responsible for tears, saying, "I don't cut off the curtain to raise the core la.
Sony, Playstation 4 Supply News, PS4 games have been a long time ago.
Sony revealed the contents of the PS4 limited edition of the Last of Part 2.
As part of the recent state-of-play announcement, Sony announced its release on February 2020.
A part of this new action game was also presented to fans.
A few days later, the Last of As2 news was published.
Sony and Norty Dog seem to return to the wind in various ways.
Since the time of PSwan, the Last of As Part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Noty Dog Neil Doracman announced that the sequel evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense, the story is magnificent and complex," he said.
In addition, it was necessary to talk about stories with many characters.
It wasn't the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolds, and the user felt this end, but in fact, it started and noticed that all other sections started."
The game did not go into a single blue ray, making it two discs.
In addition, the Last of the As Part 2 includes one or two bad Easter Eggs (via Gamespot).
Although there is no shortage of this stock, Easter Eggs in the game contain the works of nostalgic Normans.
If the Last of the As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020.
Those who have PS4 can pick up the last of the remastered with PS Plus and prepare for the sequel release.
Sony recently released a free PS4 game of Play Station Plus, including the aforementioned Noty Dog Works in October 2019.
The MLBza Show19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
If you would like to book a sequel, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie backpacks and bracelet replicas, a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
The Notoshima Mobile Sales Committee attempts to encourage residents to continue (North Korea Newspaper) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th day of Notoshima Island, which has been declining as a result of the aging population, the movement was started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council.
During the trial until December, a wagon car with daily necessities, seasonings, food, and the first day, the Susomachikai and the semi-urachokai were held.
Some of the products that were sold more than expected, and the residents asked the residents to continue saying "I am happy to choose goods."
The wagons had 110 points, including total vegetables, garbage bags and detergents.
A total of vegetables, such as potato salads that are divided into packs, can be eaten by elderly people living alone.
In the Suso-chokai, a group of residents was created, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Mr. Akira Kikuchi of the Council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizuru Harada (83) in Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping at his husband's driving, said, "I don't know when father can drive, but I want to continue."
The user also received orders such as "Don't Coffee," but "I want you to put coffee on my own."
The Council examines what was requested.
At Noto Island, there are only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the Council tried to sell the goods to save "shop weak."
From December to December, the 20 town councils on the island will be held every month and will be considered to be able to continue as business after the next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed the decision to add about $100 million to the affected population.
The cash support policy for farmers affected by droughts has been extended, and the existing farmers' allowance is significantly improved.
With additional support, approximately 33,000 million dollars were recorded to support the drought-related residents, and the target farmers were able to receive an emergency aid of $3,000.
As a subsidy program for drought-related areas, each of the 13 municipalities will provide up to $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought damage.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded a budget of more than $70 billion as a drought support.
Ronald Lee Haskel: A former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted in the spring of Texas in 2014, and was convicted of killing four of Steven and Kayty Stay, and five children.
On July 9, 2014, Haskel was pushed into the house of Stay, where his wife, Melannie Haskel, met.
Melney was absent, but his sister, Caty State and his family.
Heskel fired, and the Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39) died of a daughter of his 13-year-old son, nine-year-old son, and seven-year-old daughter.
In his family, only one person was 15 years old at the time, and only Cashy State left alone.
At that time, the authorities reported serious injuries and reports, but they recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed all charges against Ronald Lee Haskel's heart loss.
The jury was dismissed by the jury until the month of the sentence.
"If you choose to disappointment us, you will never forgive us."
Is the appeal of a girl who has caused anger to shake his voice?
Global warming is becoming more serious.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City, the 16-year-old environmental activist Gregta Tuunbury spoke to strengthen measures.
In addition to boycotting classes and sitting in front of the parliament, the school strike became a firefighter to spread around the world.
The young people who were interested in anxiety and anxiety were forced to protest all over the world including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people participated in the event.
Morioka also gave a message board to march.
The threat of climate change is approaching.
The Paris Agreement, which started in 2020, aims to reduce the global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century.
All participating countries, regardless of the distinction between developed countries and developing countries, take measures.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to the relationship between global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, follows various regions.
We need to strengthen our efforts toward global warming at a fast pace.
At the summit held by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to strengthen the crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal to achieve real zero by 50.
Other 70 countries raised their goals for the future.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which expressed the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not explicitly express the new goal, and the slowness of the movement of the nuclear power generation was becoming apparent.
The criticism of Japan's strong coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy includes zero emissions as early as the latter half of the century, and the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no chance to speak at the summit.
The Kosen Shinjiro Environmental Minister, who presented Japan's initiatives at environmental-related meetings, said that he should work on fun, cool, and sexy at the meeting on climate change.
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
We don't have any opposition to Gregory, who is now a symbol of environmental movement.
The injury that cannot be discussed will not be replaced by the question that the person opposes.
It is no longer necessary for global warming measures, and the international community must respond to the common crisis of humanity.
There is no need to be enough effective for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Gregory.
It is an adult who should act as not to steal the future.
and one step in realizing quantum internet
The results of the U.S. Army's research led to a step toward realizing quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to secure military safety that was impossible for conventional network initiatives and provide measurement and measurement.
According to the U.S. Army Research Institute's Distributed Quantum Information Center, which is funded by the U.S. Army Training Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved record of quantum entangling transport between substances and light - 50 kilometers using optical fiber cables.
Entangling is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in the entropy state, even if one quantum bit is physically distant, the other is affected by the measurement results.
"This distance [50 km] is more than two digits than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building a urban quantum network."
The city's intercity quantum network is composed of networks between physical quantum bits in entropy, despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entropy is absolutely essential to the establishment of the quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize a large decentralized empowerment," says Dr. Sarah Gambling, Deputy Secretary of the Army Program to support research.
In addition, the entropy at the exit through the fiber is also sufficient to meet the number of conditions required for some difficult quantum network use.
The team began experiments with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
The researchers used laser rays to write quantum states on the ions and excited until the quantum information was released.
As a result, the quantum state of atoms and the light particles became entropy.
The challenge is to send photons to optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of photons emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and the optical fiber cable is absorbed immediately."
In his team, he first sent light particles through nonlinear crystals with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, which is the standard wavelength of long-distance transport - the current distance communication.
He then sent this photon through a 50-mile optical fiber cable.
In the measurement results, despite the conversion of wavelengths to long distances, the atoms and light particles remained in entropy.
"The use of calcium atoms can capture calcium at the same time as high-quality "clock" quantum bits, so this experiment results will lead to the realization of an entangling network in long-distance atomic clocks.
The large entropy clock network is a very important field for the Army from precise positioning measurement, navigation, and time application."
