Croatia's nuclear treatment facility plan, Bosnian people protest
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the town of northwestern Bosnia and protested the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from its only nuclear power plant near the river known for its beautiful nature near the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The demonstration participants gathered in the town of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly requested Croatia to abandon the plan to store the site of the barracks of the Turkovska Gola and fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant.
The Bosnian people said that nuclear waste treatment facilities could threaten the lives of about 250,000 residents living in the Una River and around the river.
We must oppose it.
The mayor of Novi Grad, Miloslav Doraka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the rivers.
The Kusko nuclear power plant, which started in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is co-owned with Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will open consultations next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
On Friday, the Croatian national broadcast reported that Croatia should build its own storage facility, or that Slovenia should still not be determined to pay for the cost of the waste of Croatia, which is processed by newly constructed facilities.
Mr. To Miss Love Chorich, Minister of Environmental Protection of Croatia, said that Croatia has a problem with public waste treatment from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another construction site on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket, that's the perfect place for Turkovska Gola?"

However, it is clearly false that other people under their protection are sick.

Children are likely to be healthy, and if the condition is bad, they attempt to put down medical care.

The test results are made to make children feel sick, such as mixing grape sugar and showing diabetes.
It causes symptoms of disease by taking over drugs and other drugs.

Kaduna - The State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
The police said that children were placed in a humanitarian environment, but the school denied this claim.
The residents who call the school pastor said, "The children are in school with the consent of all parents, so their claims are not true."
"Before a child's admission, his parents signed a consent letter.
Since parents came to deliver meals to children every day, they know what kind of environment they are.
It was very surprising that the police came and fled the children, and after the parents left all the food, they closed the school.
This is an unfair treatment for parents who can testify to whether the police had children in a terrible environment.
He added that the former police headquarters Abdullahman had once visited to confirm what kind of environment the children were, but did not say any complaints.
In addition, children can learn Corran and say that it is all.
However, the police's Public Relations Office, Kappa Savo, said that children would be reunited with their parents after they were handed over to the government.
"It was nominal to get knowledge about Corran, and they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were beaten back.
That's why we are investigating schools to know the owner of the facility."

Stop the accident!
Four of the following options: Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driving mistakes.
In particular, the accident caused by the brake and accelerator step by older drivers is on an increasing trend.
In particular, when you start a sudden, it becomes a panic, and when you are going to step on the brake pedal, the accelerator will remain on track.
There is a new car equipped with a safety driving support feature that covers such a driver's mistake, but there is also a rearing device that can be mounted on an unmounted car.
Such after-sale parts manufacturers are developing and selling sudden prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what features each have.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrower, and it's going on at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALRM] To inform pedals from a new perspective, "e-ACEL ALRM" developed by Pivot.
The pedal's step mistake is to be avoided by the alarm sound.
The mechanism arises " alarm sound" when you take the accelerator pedal by mistake when you stop or slow driving.
They react to the sound and encourage the accelerator to return, and quickly recognize the step mistake to avoid rapid acceleration.
The acceleration mistake makes it difficult to understand the changes in engine sound and it is also effective for elderly drivers to hear.
It is attached to the OBDII connector, and the body is attached with both sides.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and the ease of setting is also attractive.
The World Wing started its launch in mid-September, but the accelerator brake step-by-step fault prevention device "Aya-kun."
It is also possible to withdraw without advance.
When the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped down in the forward and retreat from the stop (and less than 10Km/h), the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected and electrically suppress the accelerator opening and suppresses rapid progress.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I didn't tell the signal from the accelerator and immediately control the advance by turning it into the creeping state (where I left the brake in the D range).
At the back, there are also features that detect the speed of about 5Km/h and force the vehicle to switch to cleaner state.
The mounting can only be done with caparion and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

"If there was a child who was not able to stay at home, I had a feeling around it."
The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, where there were five children from the age of four to twelve, was immersed in water around the house.
"I can't escape with five people," he said, "I'm going to spend my time at home as much as possible in the disaster.
"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and there is no need for a family structure or residence."
Ms. Kawazaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho with a six-year-old and eight-year-old child suggested that the elementary school had an e-mail on the previous day, but the nursery school also had no email system.
There were also requests for system construction that could be shared in real time.
Mr. Kawazaki said, "The weather has changed before, and I don't understand that it was okay last time.I want to take care of the connection between small ingenuity and people and prepare for disaster."
The representative of Tanaka said, "I think that the opinions that have been issued will be communicated to the government as a group."
Contact the police agency with Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Curri.
The Police Agency (IOPC) will examine whether or not the Johnson Prime Minister should investigate the alleged scandal in London's mayor's office as a violation of penal code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that the Director General of the GLA had recorded the "Acts on Acts" of the Prime Minister on suspicion that Mr. Curri had received preferential treatment from the friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
GLA says that there is information that there is a possibility of a crime.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether or not to investigate this matter.
The problem was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC is an organization that corresponds to charges issued by police in England and Wales.
The issue was entrusted to the police agency because Johnson was at that time a position comparable to the police officer.
Johnson denied fraud related to the relationship between the two parties.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information about the relationship with the Archici.
This statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but in the press, the Americans who moved to London seven years ago were paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the London Mayor's period, and Johnson and others were given preferential measures to participate in the foreign trade-related dispatch.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to the hacker house, the company in the investigation.
The company will ask questions about the investigation process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
In the House of Representatives, Mr. Matt Waman said that the digital ministry had "normal evaluation" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office, which is said to have been based on Mr. Curri 34.
The relationship between Prime Minister and female businessmen was "the secret between the staff."
The movement of the GLA, which attempts to entrust the Prime Minister to the police agency, touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
The government's high-ranking officials said that this was a "political attack" and that the timing of the Conservative Party's previous night was "too party-oriented."
"There was no evidence for any charges, and the prime minister was not given the opportunity to answer the supervisory authority before the announcement of the press that was published late Friday night."
The public and the media will take a look at the political Kyogen that was organized by AMA.
As I mentioned earlier, the Standard Newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessman who supported London's tourism promotion and regional promotion was "public secret."
The former staff of London and Partners (L&P) said that despite the fact that he had thought that the company was "reliable" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany the foreign trade-related talks led by the Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund that can be used for the formation of property!
Morning Star - Yahoo! News
I heard the outlook for the future from Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO.
"The Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
What do you think you're feeling now?
First, in the history of 20 years, I had many thoughts and efforts.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all concerned people, not the history that has played with the power of the fund.
Originally, I came up with the idea of supporting the formation of property by ordinary people.
This spirit has remained unchanged for 20 years.
If the general public eliminates the anxiety of money, the world will be brighter from the foundation, and we are encouraged to work every day as a whole.
In the long term, operation is not graded unless you step with beneficiaries.
There are a lot of money in the fund, such as the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble.
"We want to support companies that are needed in the world since this time," I feel that we have understood the messages we have mentioned since the time of the day.
As a result, I believe that it was the reason why it became a long-term fund for 20 years and that it continued to be a direct sales system to deliver messages directly to many people.
At the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, money and costs.
Generally speaking, information about what you're buying now is black box, but all the funds have been disclosed.
Why can we trust you?
mc Miller's death, the third drug crime arrester.
Los Angeles (AP) - Last year, Rapper's Mac Miller was associated with a drug crime that died in excess of drugs and the third man was arrested.
According to the trial, Steven Walter was charged with selling fake tablets of oxycodon mixed with Fentanyl before Miller accidentally took over cocaine, alcohol and Fentanyl in September last year, but Fentanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has caused thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Pettyt, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to the trial records released on Tuesday, Pettyt had obtained drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Livis, who was arrested in Lake Habas City, Arizona earlier this week, was asked to have a drug delivered to Pettyt as Walter's "reseller."
All three are not directly charged with Miller's death, and there are still anti-bents about individual cases.
Walter, currently in custody, was sentenced to five months in prison due to drug arrest in 2005.
On Thursday, the public prosecutors in charge of the first issue reported by the celebrity site TMZ requested Walter to be detained until the trial began because of the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate response to a telephone message to a lawyer.
Pettyt was charged with the Federal Court on September 4, but the defense refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics have been characterized by a direct word about depression and drug use, and in the hip hop world, he has earned fans as one of the Great Palaces.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name, Markham James Myers McCick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, but was defeated in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of the mirror that had been loved by his Instagram and published a song about the mirror, "Sanque Neckst."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in recent years related to opioid drug abuse.
The rock band Three Doors Down guitarist Matthew Roberts died in 2016 due to excessive intake of drugs, and Fentanyl and hydrocodon were detected in the body.
This article corrected Walter's name as Stephen rather than Steven.
More than 30 mobile games in Nigeria
This 9-year-old child is using a free programming app called scratch2, which is in production of the game.
With scratch 2, you can create games, animations and stories on and offline.
Basil has made over 30 mobile games using this app.
Today's games are programmed to hide bats.
Players earn points when they catch a bat that came out of the hiding place.
He learned how to make games in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN that "I spend time on making games when I am bored."
In March, his father applied for a five-day short-term intensive course for children aged five to fifteen.
This course hosted by Code Fest International was introduced to children such as Basil to provide opportunities to experience new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing many mobile games.
"We always had a mobile phone, so I bought a tablet when I was four years old.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, he was interested in playing the game.
"One day, I was wearing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry."
He said, "I'm always playing games, but how do I make a game by myself so that others can play?"
When I said, I was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basilchan, who has been interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step of the game production.
Basilchan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has a name in his game.
One of the games, "Moskyt mash" can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is the case, the young generation, such as Basil, is led by the leadership.
Two of Nigeria's twelve-year-old children have recently been awarded a robot that uses a program code to divide housework.
In May 2019, at the Robot Fest contest, the Ghana Women's High School Team, who programmed box-loading robots, won the event.
African investment in Google and Microsoft's giant technology companies is increasing, and Basil-chan and the children of the same age are expected to become a future programming star.
the former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, the false testimony of bribery.
According to a court document submitted to Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to have false testimony to the Federal agent who conducted a major political bribery investigation.
In the list of federal court cases, Robin Hayes was convicted on Wednesday next week.
According to a document based on the fact that Hayes was prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes, Hayes was aware of the false statement of FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the documents based on facts are not specified to indicate which sin is accepted.
Hayes was initially accused of conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return to special treatment, the prosecutor accused Hazmoto's involvement in the insurance company's heavy duty plan, which poured out the reward for the governor of state insurance.
The two co-founder Greg Lindberg and co-owners were charged with attempted bribes to the Secretary of State Mike Cozy.
Lindberg, founder of insurance and investment companies, donated more than $500 million to state and federal elections candidates and committees since 2016, and has been the top political contributor in recent years.
Lindberg supported Republican principles and politicians, but also offered to the Democrats.
He asked Lindberg to comment on Friday and email, but did not reply.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the defendant of Hayes, asked E-mail to add additional comments.
The Court documents submitted to Friday stated that Hayes had written false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes stated that he did not speak with the State Insurance Bureau staff.
However, according to the fact-based documents, Hayes was actually talking about the transfer of personnel in the insurance department from the State Insurance Agency and Lindberg.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindberg's request that he would like to meet with Corsey, and also talked about direct bribes with the director.
In April, the prosecution announced that Lindberg would seek special treatment for his own insurance business, and would have planned to raise $200 million to the election campaign aimed at reelection in 2020.
According to the prosecution, the conspiracy involved a request for the replacement of the authorities who reviewed the company in Lindberg.
Republican Corsey reported suspicions of bribery to federal agents and helped them.
Coggie has no doubts.
In the case of prosecution, the co-founder of Lindberg instructed Hayes to send $50,000 to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the prosecution, Hayes was initially opposed to taking care of the money, but eventually broke out in conversation.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes said, "What do you want?"
i understand.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office reported that E-mail asked for more information about judicial transactions, but did not respond.
Facebook, aim to improve the user's happiness!
In the world's first attempt to raise the sense of happiness of users, some users will soon like posting others!
This change follows the similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, and good!
The new Facebook attempt began on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager Amy Garrick stated that this change is based on feedback from mental health professionals who will cause a number of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "There was a very positive feedback from many bully groups and mental health organizations working together."

Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more confident than they feel competitive.
Garrick said that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights they had previously accessed.
Instagram tests such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, and other countries, it is time to say that testing is similar.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test ends or will remain unchanged.
"There were initially positive feedback about experience in Instagram, but now it is a step to listen to feedback and learn."
Garrick, who is in Australia in the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very aggressive "technique" Facebook and Instagram user.
He thought Australia would be a great country to get really good feedback about whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

One day, my mother's favorite bag was removed and I couldn't move somewhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it and continue to love it.
I helped you when I was in the hands of Cando.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, the spine is the ultimate pchipra.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair the repair, the price of the body was significantly higher.
My mother unfortunately said, "I don't want to give up."
First, I went to the Home Center and looked for the replacement of this connected fixture.
However, even if there is a ring-shaped metal, everything is silver.
Gold didn't look at anything.
I went to Candu and finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it in the handicraft corner.
It's 100 percent as expected.
Originally it seems to be a part used for key holders and charme DIY.
Each bag handle is scheduled to be used one by one at the end of the bag.
Although the size of the ring is small, the left side of the bag is lined with the fittings, making exactly the same!
This opened the way to bag repair.
It is attached.
what?
The ring openings are designed to break inside and are resistant to pulling outside.
I attached it to my bag.
I feel that the color of the metal is good with the gold system ♪ However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor ...
So I decided to put the ring together.
Because of the lightweight parts, there is no problem with weight.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts that have been cracked has increased and the design level has been improved.

His famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket team and wearing a bright red dress in Valentine's Day.

In fact, Mr. Kenjiro Shigeki, who has been thinking about "mote" as a brain scientist.
The brain science mote theory is a surprise that uses enormous knowledge and latest knowledge.
Then we will send you a piece.
In the previous section (see related article), Moteno otoko firmly adheres to the traditional "man's fantasy" and the pattern learning for mote is overwhelming!
Later, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad man and become a cool man.
i'm going to live with you.
In the first part, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day, looking at various works, people's behavior, and so on.
When you learn patterns, you might be able to live in a rack because the brain can systematically organize actions.
I think I'm still evolving every day as if I don't know what to do.
That's why we live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked to many young people and learned a lot of patterns of interaction with them.
However, if you are bound by the position of a university professor, you might be a bit painful if you're in the old pattern that says, "The teacher of the university has more dignity."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, you'll be alive when you say, "What should I do?"
But even if you don't change, society will change.
I've been talking about that in my recent talk book, "No matter how terrible the world is."

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the announcement of the United Nations on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled by about 40,000 in the four months due to the intensified violence.
According to the UN Refugees Agency, this confusion has resulted in a new humanitarian crisis, with each organization working together to raise $35 million by the end of the year.
The UNHCR report said that the Islamic extremist organization Bokohalam, which has been active in anti-government in northern Nigeria for ten years, is unrelated to several recent armed attacks.
Rather, violent acts in the last ten months of Nigeria's Sokot, Zamfala, and Kazina were organized by armed groups.
"We often show the fear of illegal and unstable situations," said Barrok on Friday.
The kidnappers, torture, assaults, murders and sexual violence often occur, and the raiders said that they are working to destroy their homes and theft.
The military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with the West African branch of the Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name."
What they're doing is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to the neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR stated that the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger were expected to increase in the next few months.

He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.
Sonet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising on header binding by Predid.js in LFP.
LFP provides services to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks, tailored to the needs of advertisers.
The Services provide effective advertising frameworks via DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Depending is a mechanism that allows a fair bid competition with multiple vendors (adverted companies) to deliver high-cost advertising to media operated by media.
As a solution for media companies that are transparent and can expect to improve profitability, the introduction of major media is progressing.
Until now, SSP has been provided with advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in response to requests from advertisers, "I want to deliver to specific advertising frames with high affinity with individual commercials and brand images," the LFP launched in December last year to directly purchase advertising frames associated with advertisers' requests.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header binding is enabled directly to participate in bids for header binding advertising, and it is expected to improve the delivery opportunities for advertising.
Due to the limited edition of the media, the advertising framework for the distribution of individual goods and brand images is secured, preventing damage to brand value.
The benefit of media companies is that the solution for managing and managing the code of Bedder companies, called the "Rapper Solution," will enable them to work closely with the hope of introducing the media.

Two months later, Assistant Professor Yamagata stopped at Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that he was suspended for two months as an assistant professor at the U.S. Sawa Campus.
The same date.
According to the Department of General Affairs, in October 2017, an assistant professor gave a strong mental stress when he taught multiple students belonging to the laboratory.
He was a professor of education and was recognized to have deteriorated the school environment.
There were several students in the survey conducted in September 1818.
In December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistants, and in December of the same year, the faculty of the U.S. campus conducted a survey of harassment prevention measures by faculty members, and finally filed harassment from one student.
In response to the findings from the committee, the President and the Board of Directors decided to punish them.
After the survey, he continued to teach, but his actions were improved through interviews, and he said he was "not sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deep sympathy to victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to take all of my studies to prevent harassment and strive to recover trust."
In addition, the Department of Engineering has conducted internal investigations to determine whether or not a female student has committed sexual harassment.
Cabinet's Rebellion Requests to Boris Johnson to reduce EU withdrawal requests and compromise with the EU.
Now, only three weeks after the EU summit, which is a settlement, there is a growing concern about the fact that the prime minister is not taking a significant concession.
Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion in the Cabinet, seeking to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and to link a compromise with the EU.
The negotiations on a new tariff system, which replaces the back stop clauses related to the Irish border, are packed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "improvable."
The Senior Ministers are expected to propose compromises, such as establishing a three-year time limit on the back stop, to the Conservative Party leader led by the German Prime Minister Angela Merkel.
The Sun spoke to three ministers, who were facing the Prime Minister after the Conservative Party's annual meeting in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the " extremity" strategy that threatens the EU, which was invented by the Senior Advisor Dominique Curings, without agreement, and insist that the EU will accept the offer that the EU will take advantage of restrictive time.
One cabinet said that the ruling that the Supreme Court was illegal on Tuesday was "the police bell," and that the compromise was the only way we could withdraw from October 31.
We will never win in the House, and they oppose us.
The Prime Minister must use what can be used more than a step.
It is not effective even in extremism, and the planning of the cammings is obviously unsuccessful.
It is not possible to fight in many areas.
Another cabinet promised to talk to Johnson to run an agreement with Prime Minister Terry the May.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, we will talk to Bolis to return Terryza's agreement to the House."
That's why we have a number of things, and everyone is trying to end this.
If you don't postpone, Boris is over and we're all over.
John Mayer condemned Boris to not seriously consider negotiations.
The former leader of the Conservative Party said, "The prime minister wants to connect with the EU.
However, we do not look at the fact that the Prime Minister will establish an agreement with the EU.
Instead, we saw that in Scotland, the prime minister is fighting with pews, inspecting eggs in the Ureez, and discussing with the people in the street.
The prime minister said yesterday that the agreement is still far ahead, "If no one wants to achieve the goal, the way is still long."
However, the press also stated that the bill to force a three-month delay in the absence of an agreement would significantly weaken the position of our negotiations in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders the position of our negotiations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are trying to continue their efforts and progress despite the establishment of the bill."
The European Union withdrawal minister Steven Barclay returns to Brussels today for further consultation with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two discuss how the regulation of all Irish islands on food and livestock is functioning.
Lorain Kelly: The Glasgow accent told me that it would not be a success in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, said that he was told by the boss of the TV station that he would not succeed.
Prior to his first appearance in the television screen, Kelly, who was 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I worked as a researcher at the BBC Scottish branch and told my boss not to succeed in the absolute television industry in your Glasgow accent.
Before he took over the Glasgow office, he went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris had interviewed legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found that my place is here.
Kelly began working as a local newspaper reporter in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a TV-am Scottish reporter in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as a host of programs for GMTV and ITV's Breckfast and Daybreaks, and then began a program named after her name.
To celebrate the 35th anniversary, Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews were broadcast.
He added that passion and enthusiasm and curiosity were the secret to survival in the television industry, and that the moderator said, "We must put it into work."
It must be honest, and sincere.
I am interested in various people and interested in them.
Looking back on the news that was shocked in my mind, Kelly revealed that it was "very painful" for the Danbulane Gun Incident.
The next day, 16 students and teachers were killed, and I didn't think we could see a lot of children who were killed or wounded.
Because Pam Ross, a mother and five-year-old daughter, was killed, personally wants to see me, we've been talking about hours at her house.
I went to Jo Anna's funeral and Pam and I've been friends since.
In addition, Kelly interviewed the couple in 2007 when Kate and Geary McCartan's daughter Maddenrain was missing, saying that it was "very painful" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the harsh nets that do not know what is happening in their beloved daughter.
The couple won't really be poisoned.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine was broadcast on 8:30 AM on Monday, September 30.
gwenga, fearing traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined due to concerns that the offer of President Robert Mugabe, in the midst of a political change, might be a trap that would lead the military action in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the defense forces continued, and Mugabe offered to give Chiwenga the presidency, and last week the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper reported.
However, the reason why Chiwenga rejected the offer is that Mugabe's intention was to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of the regime in a coup rather than anxiety.
According to a series of Twitters in which the authorities confirmed that they were senior officials of the Cabinet Office, Mugabe, who had held the government for 37 years, was willing to give the government to Chiwenga rather than Emerson Munangagwa, and it was said that a fierce negotiation was held at that time.
The government officials said that Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, tried to contact the envoy to Chiwenga.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the deceased and former presidents was done by three.
President Spokesman George Charanba, the top representative of the Central Intelligence Organization at that time, Aaron Nepela and the Roman Catholic Bishop Philips Mukonoli were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, former Governor of the Zimbabwe Reserve Bank, was commissioned by Mugabe to give the President's seat to commander Chiwenga.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, attempted to condemn the African Union's military action while seeking intervention by leaders from African countries.
The offer to give the presidency to former CDF (the commander of Chiwenga) was not by the choice of former president.
"Some of the late President's family began to fatigue, and it was a wasteful action to save the rapidly expanding situation as dangerous," he wrote.
However, at least the political objective of the late President was to change the flow even in diplomacy.
If you want to destroy the constitutional order, you would have to collide with the views of the African Union on the coup, but you would like to remember that the commander had declared that it would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top of the military at that time, would take a trap and destroy the claims of commanders claiming to have not defeated the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe wanted the African Union to decide whether to position a coup without fully grasping the entire situation, but ultimately to be considered valid, without being called a coup.
It was intended and calculated at the bottom of this offer.
When the defense forces realized that they were not protected, Mugabe was moving, and the authorities speak.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi in the military, and Mugabe had to write his resignation.
The commanders of the army told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the president's house, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that point, Mugabe wanted two of them to protect their families, and to prove their power by the military.
The commanders and commanders at that time read exactly their intentions.
The word "is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa" (which we belong to the military department) was used as a powerful metaphor for political competition unless we were a politician.
The Army reported that through the military commanders in the region, the purpose was to remove the "criminal" surrounding him rather than to defeat Mugabe.
In order to discuss the coups and successors, Mugabe sought to return to South Africa with the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
As the key South Africans in this process refused to intervene, the South Africans were immediately sent to Harare, as the military had repeatedly threatened behind them.
"It was not possible to achieve this because it was not supported by Putin and African leaders," he said.
The ratification of the treaty in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun at Esss
【New York】 On the 26th of the United Nations Headquarters in New York, a meeting was held to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.
The new five countries ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratified it in 32 countries.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons on the 26th of the United Nations.
In recent years, Secretary-General Gutelres also expressed a strong concern as a move to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"We're not going to eliminate it."
China needs strong leadership, and if it doesn't matter, the collapse of policy documents
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In the White Paper, the National Council of China stated that since the Communist Party took the administration 70 years ago, it was the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified strong leadership, China would go to division and collapse and become a disaster for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long been justified to address issues in a rigid manner, as is necessary for national stability, such as the suppression of the democratization movement in Beijing in 1989.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held the government in late 2012.
He also directed the military modernization program that threatened the region.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development model, nor does it intend to incorporate the models of other countries, but merely seeking peace rather than supremacy.
Some of the genes of the Chinese people do not invade or control the world.
In modern times, China was bullied from the column, and the war and chaos left a deep scar with its pain; China would never be able to make the pain he experienced by others.
China is faced with difficult problems such as economic stagnation and anti-government movement in Hong Kong, China, as well as economic stagnation.
China will never abandon its core interests, and will not allow security and sovereignty to be compromised.
"The threat of trade war and the tariffs that continue to rise are nothing to solve the problem," says White Paper in connection with the trade dispute with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with the momentum of complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market spaces and strong economic development.
"It will never be weakened by the trade war," said White.
I am convinced that China is facing difficulties and has the ability to transform crisis into opportunities and open a new world.
Since China has no idea to counter the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., the United States should calmly capture the development of China.
The U.S. cannot control China, and it is also possible to stop China's development.
If the U.S. would not maintain strength if it would suppress, suppress, suppress, and move the contradictions in the country abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka was dismissed from the director Hirata and the director of Kinko.
On the 28th of spring summer, the famous gate of high school baseball, Yokohama Taka, won five national championships, announced that he was dismissed by Toru Hirata (36) and Masamasa Kaneko (42).
In the future, he is acting as a coach and the manager (a responsible teacher) decides promptly.
Director Hirata and director Kinko reported that the local newspaper had an appeal to baseball club on 26th.
When the school heard the situation from two people, the director Hirata seized the student's neck and the director Kimko admitted some of the rumors.
In addition, on the basis of the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the fact was confirmed by two people again, and the fact was generally accepted and dismissed on 28 August.
In the summer of 15 Yokohama, director Motochika Watanabe (74) who raised Shosaka Daisuke (present-day Nakaday) and raised him, won't be brave.
He was the director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
He competed in the Kokoen Garden for three consecutive years from the summer of 16th to the present spring Senbatsu.
However, after losing to Sagamihara in the semi-finals in the summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semi-finals, and the next spring Senbatsu was desperate.
The Spice Girls' MelC, a diet disorder, and the diet topic is prohibited in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melannie Chizom admitted that they banned diets at home from the experience of their own diet disorder, which has not eaten any fruit and vegetables for many years.
The sporty spices have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders after long periods of time, without having to eat sufficiently well under the pressure of members of the global pop group.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by the child care of his daughter Skerlet, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"Skerlet is now 10 years old, and I'm going to take care of my own appearance."
However, since I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when I talked with my daughter.
Positive words, now it is a habit.
In the 1990s, as a member of the Spice Girls, Mer said in an interview with Women's Health magazine that, in front of SNSdai, a "bad" comment on himself written in the press led to physical problems.
"I couldn't take care of myself, and I was able to get rid of a particular food group and get rid of the exercise, and it was too slim."
I didn't have any physical condition, and it lasted for a few years."
The judge of the same sex marriage, the opportunity to expand diversity: the Hokkaido Shimbun
In the case of a dispute between marriage and marriage, the Utsunomiya District Court Maoka Branch recognized this.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize the same sex marriage, and there is no legal effect in Japan.
The decision was based on the fact that two women were married.
It is considered the first judicial decision to recognize legal protection by the same sex couples.
There are five lawsuits in Sapporo, such as Sapporo, for which marriage is not permitted due to the provisions of civil law and family register law.
In order to overcome the ruling, I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights of sexual minorities and deepen the discussion of the legal system that recognizes diverse families.
Females lived in the United States for about seven years and received a marriage certificate in the United States.
The ruling was recognized as "the reality of marriage between men and women" due to the results of two living together.
It is a revolutionary decision to expand the recognition of marriage with the right to marry in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of which marriage is based solely on the mutual agreement.
Both sexes were "it was not assumed that the marriage was not expected at the time of the establishment, and the purpose of denying the marriage is not solved."
It is expected that the Constitution is not supposed to be a sexual marriage, but it is likely that the government does not say whether or not it is prohibited, and it is expected to be the driving force of the same-sex marriage lawsuits throughout the country.
On the other hand, since the marriage was not recognized, the issue remained a challenge, as "the benefit of legal protection between men and women is different."
While recognizing the same reality as between men and women, the difference in the right to protect is not possible.
According to the National Family Trend Survey conducted by married women, the public's awareness has changed, including 70% of those who should be admitted by law.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, the law is tied to traditional family statues, and it will take away the rights of people who are not fit.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" that admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the absence of joint custody.
In considering marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from various viewpoints, such as not only marriage between sex, but also the expansion of legal rights of marriage.
the trial of the former athlete in charge of rape against multiple women, the jury trial
A jury trial was conducted by the former Delaware University baseball player in charge of sexual assault on multiple women.

<New Sports on September 27
it's a serious pollution of popular tourist spots, and it's obviously videos.
In Sydney's tourism resources, which will bring $210 million annually to the Australian economy, Sydney Harbour is the largest producer of opera houses, thermal keys, rna parks and famous Herbert Bridges.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of the worst waterways in Australia, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow every year.
Thanks to this statistics, one of our biggest attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to the new video of the title from Sydney Harbour, the most popular city waterway in Australia is flowing into Sydney Harbor by rainwater flowing through the road.
Among them, the biggest factor to break the waterway is plastic.
In a video released on September 27 of the World Tourism Day, Dr. Catherine Dufour of the Sydney Harbour Research Program said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but one of Japan's coastlines is quite modified and polluted.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drains.
"There was a lot of heavy rains, but after that, Sydney Harbour was quite tragic," Dr. David said.
Two-thirds of pollution flows from rainwater flowing through the road.
But it's like a corner of the iceberg, and 70 percent of plastics flowing into the ocean are deposited in the ocean.
"I really don't know what the truth is if I don't go down the sea level, but I don't know what it is," said David Center Manley, owner Richard Nicols, who will recover plastic waste of about 500 kilograms each year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is there under the water surface), I think everyone is really cool.
It's overwhelming, but more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
The remaining half is used for plastics at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone that all plastics and garbage are flowing down the water immediately.
Mr. Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of Ocean Protect, said that local residents can also visit tourists to reduce plastics and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he should start from the source of origin.
In addition to reducing the use of plastics, recycling more well, and finally flowing into the ocean, we need to be more conscious about what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of oxygen we breathe will come from the ocean, and it will kill us to hurt the ocean.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a source of food.
But we repair Sydney Harbour and return to the old scene, but it's very simple.
killing the sea is killing humans.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also announced in this month, as part of the activities of the Australian public to widely know about environmental protection and the reduction of the effects of beverage containers in the natural environment.
According to a new survey, 82 percent of the 546 children aged 12 to 18 have a sense of despair about plastic waste and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is an adult.
In this study, the problem of plastic waste was ranked fourth in concern for parents, and the researchers said that 93 percent of the parents surveyed felt increasingly anxious about the amount of plastic waste in the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.

From October to October, the former Karatsu power plant began to be demolished.
The Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that the demolition of the chimney of the former Karatsu power plant (oil-fired power plant) in Nitako, Tangzu City began in October.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantlement was used to emit gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991 due to aging.
One chimney splits from top to bottom with a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months to break each other and takes 18 months.
The time to break the remaining turbines and boilers is uncertain.
The 60-year-old man, who runs a restaurant nearby, said, "When I look back to the chimney, I feel like a symbol that made me feel back to Tangzu."
The former Karatsu power plant began operating in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second was abolished in 2015.
Located in the corner of the port of Karatsu, there is an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Due to the nearby Yacht Harbor and JR West Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.

Thai rice is mixed with shiitake and carrot.
The company is responsible for the cooking of "Oritori Ichiba-no-cho," a seafood company in Hayashi-cho, Ono City.
The school began in June.
During the tour, I visited the factory in Owashi and deepened my understanding of the water industry.
In the workshop, we talked about the needs of consumers and tried the prototype.
He also invented a naggage, but because of the smell of fish, he adopted muz.
Mr. Masaki Yamaguchi (17) said, "It's a product that can be eaten by people who don't like fish, and I'm happy to eat many people."
It is said that they are negotiating with the city's tourism facilities to sell goods.
This is because I was encouraged to scold my love (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Mr. Masao Takahashi, a free announcer and CBC TV "CBC TV" on Monday, said to his master.
the teacher's advice that saved me who was rotten.
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a master, beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
It's different from what I'm doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to get my mind, and even as a working person, important things.
When he was told to be a television announcer at the end of his efforts, he was told to be a television announcer, and when he was hurt, he said, "Well, I didn't think that's it.
At the time of the second and third year of joining the company, I was only working "Anyone of the women in the sky" and I didn't have any motivation to do what I wanted to do, but when I was humiliating my mind, I asked everyone to do it, but I asked him to do it.
I read the news that I learned naturally from my father's play.
There may be many people who haven't seen me reading news, but in fact, after joining the TV station, I've been in touch with the news all over the years since I joined the TV station.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe said, "It was good to read the news of Mama."
When I read the news, I feel that it's important and sense is "between."
My father's stage, film, television, and time dramas have been seen in my childhood.
In other words, I think that it is thanks to my father because I have a lot of experiences in various types of programs and how to deal with them.

is it the key to the cancer treatment?
Tusmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could bring major reform to patient treatment.
Medical researchers have found out how some cancer cells are.
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmaniadeville and humans.
In this discovery, new methods for treating cancer patients are expected.
What is the common relationship between Tasmania and humans?
It is a cancer cell that cannot be seen.
The team, including researchers at Peter McClellon Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there are cancers that do not react to immunotherapy, they could significantly change treatment for cancer.
It may have been the key to addressing a deadly face tumor that threatens the future of the Tasmanian Deville, just before extinction.
In this study, some cancer cells in humans and bags used a series of proteins called PRC2 to cause markers to react and the immune system would not attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a kind of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and Merkel cells.
Prof. Mark Doson, a researcher at Peter McCalm column said, "The very important thing in this project is that we might be able to reverse that process for patients who have been resistant to immunotherapy."
The immune system may be able to identify cancer cells by reusing conventional therapies and reactivation of proteins known as markers, namely MHC.
"There may be considerable impact on patients with lung cancer," Dr. Doson said.
"The lung cancer is a disease in the world.
And there may be much better way to treat.
Researchers expect that this discovery will eventually be used to treat the face-to-face tumor of Tasmanian Deville, where cancer cells escape detection.
"It's surprising that the same process will happen at all (in the gun of human and Tasmanian Deville)," Dr. Doson said.
"It was very hard to treat Tusmaniadeville tumor.
However, if a drug that is effective in humans can be used in Tasmaniadeville, it may be possible to help control the tumor."
scientists are also puzzled by giant planets orbiting the polar stars.
Scientists discover and surprise the solar system covering the current understanding of planetary formation, which orbits around a small star called a red dwarf, at a distance of 30 light years from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of a giant gas planet GJ3512b was released around a red dwarf star.
The star is usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around it.
However, in this case, there is no difference in the size of stars and planets, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"That's another surprise," said Juan Carlos Morales, an astronomical physicist at the Catalan Space Institute at the Institute of Space Science, Spain.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Royal Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star and takes around 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only quite small than our Sun, but also the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, the surface temperature is much lower than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 (degree) Kelvin (380° / 3527°).
So it's a red color."
On the other hand, while the second planet is now orbiting the star, the third planet may have been released from its star system in the past.
Planets are generated from the same disk consisting of stars that themselves generate orbiting.
The most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core integration" model, causes objects from solid particles in the disk, resulting in the gas surrounding the atmosphere by pulling the eggs on the planet.
This unusual planetary system can be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the primitive planetary disk around the star that was born might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature was lower."
Because disks become unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses can grow until they collapse and form planets.
i'm going to take care of my colleagues, and i'm going to be indicted.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernandes (38) is accused of eating dipping beans with awakening agents to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Albany's Cassandra Animina Hernández (38) was charged with suspicion that the transfer of methane fetamin and regulatory drugs to others, a B-grade sin.
The charges were caused by an incident occurred at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on 9 September.
According to the estimated cause of the testimony obtained from OwenLive.com, the suspect's coworkers (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked Medina Hernández to taste a little bit because Medina Hernández saw the making of beans dip.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane fetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after I ate it, but I didn't think it was a good drug."
When the woman returns to work, the stomach becomes worse and the legs were fluffy.
According to the Albane Demoklat Herald, a local hospital where women went was judged to have had methane fetamine mixed with beans.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said that Medina Hernández had told the victim's food that "the drug was put on," while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message that he had accidentally put methane fetamine into beans.
According to the Oregon Live article, it is said that the surveillance video captured by Deli is a picture of what is taken out of the Brager, although Medina Hernandes is pointing back to the camera and behind the microwave.
After that, it is said that he lifted up and wipes his nose and walked toward the table to put the beans in a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were put on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff said that there were no customers who had been contaminated food now.
Medina Hernandes was placed in Marion County prison instead of $52 million in bail.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of assaults, robbers, suffrage, transfer of methane fetamin, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

5 medical institutions in Saga Prefecture | The Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun
As the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare required reorganization and integration, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced their hospital name on 26th.
The total number of 13 medical institutions in the prefecture is 38 and 5%, which is the tenth highest in the country and has already been consolidated and relocated.
The name of the hospital in the prefecture was Higashi Saga Hospital (Mikimachi, Mikoshi-gun), Chikyu City Hospital, Kojo Citizen's Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), which promotes regional medical functions, and Tayoshi Town, Fujitsu County.
In addition, the City Hospital and the Kojo Municipal Hospital have been integrated into the plan to build a new hospital in Tokyu-cho, Chikyu City, and Imari Matsuura Hospital is decided to transfer to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of comprehensive care in the town and has continued to operate surplus in recent years.
The mayor of Nagabuchi emphasized that "the town is operated alone, and there is a way to cooperate with the hospitals in neighboring towns.The hospital has absolutely to remain for residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The Director of the Office of the East Saga Hospital said, "We don't listen to the contents from the prefecture," and stated that "We will actively participate in the Regional Health Initiative Meeting in the prefecture and respond to the purpose of discussions."
The Regional Medical Function Promotion Agency (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not mechanically determined by the direction of the public hospital, but it is said that it was requested to reconsider the direction of each prefecture's regional medical concept meeting again."
The representative of the Department of Medical Affairs, which explains the country's thinking, said, "I want to listen carefully to the parties about the future hospital operations.
In some cases, we may review medical subjects and ask for further reduction in hospital beds."

Michele Obama, instagram, gave megan markle inspiration and praise.
Michele Obama highly praised Magan Markle on Thursday, a favorable Instagram, and called the wife of the Duke of Sassex to break the type and make the world better.
The Duke's wife and Prince Harry met with his son, Arche Harrison Mountbatten-Winzer, who attended the reception of young people this week and met with the executive of the Obama Foundation.
The former President's wife wrote a very positive post: "The old custom is broken and the thoughtful leader who makes the world better, my friend, Princess Sassex, thank you.
Mrs. Obama wrote a photo of Mrs. Megan, who poses with the Foundation's executives, adding that "Even with the Obama Foundation's executives, the support of girls around the world, who seek appropriate education, is stimulating to many people."
Mrs. Magan, former "suit" actress, served as guest editor in the September issue of Vogue magazine and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In a direct conversation, former President's wife recalled how her mother and mother changed herself.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "My mother is like being in an advanced class to let go."
My job was almost always as a mother to find out what children want to do and to keep the proper distance to grow.
In order to find out who they are, in essence, are not the ideals for children as parents and their childhood aspirations.
In fact, Obama's wife, who actually knows the pressure on spotlights in the world, advised the Duke by little by little while at the Interview of Good Housekeeping magazine.
Sometimes, the pressure from yourself and people around you can feel too large.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't have time to do anything.
In the first few months in the White House, instead of starting to work ambitiously, the girls began to live in school well, and the new friends were distracted.

Trump Hotel owner's complaints, liquor sales permit is retained.
Washington (AP) - The State of Washington's Alcohol and Drinking Committee (AP) rejected the appeal that Washington should review the license of the local Trump International Hotel's alcoholic beverages because the owner has questioned the appropriateness of the owner.
The committee filed a complaint with three members, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders on Wednesday, with most of the petitioners not living in Washington or having fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, the appeal to the cancellation of the right to provide alcohol at the hotel is twice based on the State Law, which requires the applicant to obtain a license for sale of liquor.
In the first appeal submitted in the summer of last year, he repeatedly accused President Trump's assault and claimed that he violated the state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
In response to the renewal of the license, this second appeal was issued.
The bees collected by the honeybee "FairBees" breeders are harvested for the first time!
How is the taste of honey collected by FlyingBees who are bred in the knee of the Flying B?
In May 2019, a set-up bee was started on the site of the UK Bentley Crew Factory, and the first honey was harvested in September.
More than 100 bottles of honeybees were collected from only two nest boxes.
In the factory grounds where the car was assembled, why did Bentley become a beekeeper?
I want to taste this!
Here are the bees that Bentley works.
Peter Bosch, director of the manufacturing department of Bentley, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to biodiversity conservation in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Factory this year.
From wildflowers planted on the site and wild mountains around the area, the beekeepers have been watching how the honeybees are collecting various flowers.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful that there is so much harvest in the first year.
Through the crew and our business, Bentley has been promoting a wide range of activities as much as possible as possible to the top of a sustainable luxury car manufacturer.
The staff are actively cooperating.
It is very nice to have the first harvest successfully, and next year we set up more nests and plan to increase the harvest volume of bees from Bentley.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to work on various initiatives to fulfill our role in the future."In May 2019, 12 million honeybees "FairBees" were started.
In September of the same year, more than a summer, the work of removing the nest from the nest box was completed and the nest was filtered with a centrifugal separation machine, and then the bees dropped by the drop were poured.
You can also see the bottle and package of honey as well as betrays.
The design of the label was directed by Louise Mass column, designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only distributed to the staff but also a gift to important customers and customers who visit the crew factory.

The police continued to report that it was the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud in all areas.
The Cleveland Police continued to "a serious deterioration," and the police director Phil Gomley said.
The police had five police officers in six years, and now they are facing a voice asking for new demolition.
According to the report, he failed to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and defend social weakness.
The police director Phil Gomley said, "We have continued to deteriorate much more seriously since we were finally investigating."
The police chief Mike Vil resigned in less than a year in January, but he was "a serious" about his actions, but was investigated for several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was arrested for serious illegal acts and was suspended.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to an illegal investigation committee for his colleagues to act sexually.
He resigned from the police.
The Conservative Party Mayor Ben Howin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
It's time for the Interior Ministry to intervene."
The police chief Richard Lewis said, "We have been improving, but we are all responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Bar was a "criminal" and an impeachment must be settled.
I don't know what's going on.
At present, we believe that we are involved in the incident that has been covered by cover-up, and it may take some time to investigate," said Peloci in Congress to interview CNN.
"I'm going to do my work based on the fact-related relationship and the time to discover facts."
In the White House Record published this week, Trump found that President Worodimir Zerensky of Ukraine asked the candidate Joe Biden before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to the call records, Trump also asked Zelensky to cooperate with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Ledi Juliaini.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN first noticed internal accusations against Trump's actions involving Ukraine over a week prior to formal inquiry, and reported on Thursday.
The Ministry of Justice accused Trump's telephone meeting as a reference to information agencies, determined that he was not involved in the investigation of political financing.
In response to the question that Mr. Bar should testify, Pelosi stated on Friday that the intelligence special committee would determine who witnesses.
However, Mr. Pelosi added that Mr. Bar was "a criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"It was the name of the bar from the beginning," said Peloci, who touched upon Trump's name on the phone meeting in July with President Ukraine.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be approaching the judgment regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" about the internal accusations that had become a source of information, that Trump attacked the accused on Thursday as a spy.
President's statement is too irresponsible and dangerous.
He said that the internal accusations play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to the internal accusations," he said.
Mr. Peroci reported that on Tuesday, he publicly impeached the Trump clan and wrote a historical step.
The content of the call is included in the accusations released on Thursday, and the internal accusations claim that Trump abused his position to seek intervention in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
In addition, the internal accusations also claimed that the White House advisors instructed officials to remove calls from the cabinet-class computer system and replace them with special sensitive systems.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the review committee
Cofi Manuel, a football ampist and executive of Secondi Hasscus, expressed concern about the composition of the next Ghana Football Association (GFA) election committee.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davis, and expressed dissatisfaction with that.
In the interview with GNA sports, Mr. Manuel said that the chairman had interests in the outcome of the examination process, and that it was fair to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from an outside without prior interest.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, he argued that he had interests, and that the commission of the jury should not be allowed.
On the other hand, Mr. Manuel stated that if the Olympic Board member Fred Papoe attended the committee, the relationship between the club and the chairman would cause conflicts of interest, he suggested that if he attended the committee, he would be biased and unfair.
The committee members were scheduled to start activities yesterday after their inauguration at the GFAAkra Secretariat on September 19.
The chairman is Frank Davis, a corporate governance consultant, and a member of the committee is Mr. Marian Barano and Emmanuel Darker.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales Director Richard Akpocavi.
The survey found that 54-2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture think that the target of raising the minimum wage will be "good for minimum wage thousand yen."
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies that had been able to secure the number of plans was around 50% of new graduates and senior employees.
Companies who answered "approved" to raise the yen at the time (100 percent), construction (70,6 percent) and wholesale (61,7 percent).
The percentage of the " opposite" was the manufacturing industry (51-9 percent) and service industry (60 and 9 percent), including food and drink, and accommodation.
The representative of the conference said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources, and increase labor costs."
The average amount of money was 895 yen (from 4 October to 829 yen in Fukui Prefecture).
When I heard the employment situation in March 19, the new employment of regular employees was 61,3 percent, and the mid-term adoption was 54,5 percent, and non-regular employment was conducted by 154%.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure was 44,7 percent in new graduates, 50 and 3 percent in the middle, and non-regulars remained 31 percent.
In particular, the transportation industry (New graduates 13 and 3 percent), the construction industry (24,1 percent of new graduates, and 38,1 percent) struggled.
The overall 86-4% of the respondents had challenges in hiring, and in many cases, the company's reputation was low.
As a measure of government requests for adoption activities, there were many voices asking for the enhancement and provision of information for the introduction of new graduates (in three years after graduation) and mid-term adoption.
In addition to providing PR opportunities to students from outside of the prefecture and supporting various internships, there was also a view to encouraging students to approach their approach.
15.3% of the country's sub-sectoral and/or business proposed in the growth strategy answered, "I already admit."
In addition to 20 and 3% of the intention to recognize the future, one third of the total was admitted.
Companies that do not recognize were 64 percent, with the construction industry (82,8 percent), retail (73,1 percent) and manufacturing (72,7 percent).
The survey was conducted between July 19 and August 2 by 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8 percent) answered.

i heard the voice before the battle with typrick
Justin Tiprick said, "It's a place to show you now."
If Wales won the Walladad, it would be the hottest winner of the Pool D, probably the semi-finals against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia has played 15 matches against Wales, the Typrick and the team will be one of the best eight races in England.
"It's natural, I want to challenge both teams and end up winning at the top of the group."
The match against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win in autumn last year.
Australia thinks it's a lot to blame for returning the loan, but it's until we try to win it again.
Before I came here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
and i came here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won only one win in the previous World Cup, both Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and the victory to Wala beads is a 3rd place, 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gautland, the total score for the Southern Hemisphere weight class 3 teams is only 7 wins in 41 battles.
Wales stopped the last November test match against Australia in 13, but Tiprick included several representative members who won the match 9-6 and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
He said, "It's hard to answer."
I'm sure the game was good, and maybe we thought we should win, but I don't know well.
As a result, I made sure about 15 points in the final match, so I seemed to have been far more competitive than actually."
To win Wales, a combination of Australia, which is worshiped as Back Lo, Michael Hoper and David Pocock, and a breakdown battle with Tiprick is key.
In the past, Tiprick has experienced 67 international matches and has been able to compete with both players in the past and knows what is waiting.
"They are definitely a world-class backs player," he says.
When you fight against the backrows of the world glass, you always know that you will come to a tough match.
They are always the highest level in the world.
So I know what kind of game will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in a defensive battle, but it can be said that Michael is one of the most aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense of having to go properly to the desired place.
I want to increase myself by fighting with the best players in the world.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against the two, you have to do it well.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important match for us.
the momentum is important.
If you continue to build a good performance, you can do a game that won't lose on the momentum.

In Eastenders, the column highway ( Tony Clay) was surprised at the sudden bomb news of Whitney Dean (showna McGurty), and the column returned to the original of the lover, and the hot tension between the column and Ben Mitchell (max Bowen) was about to explode.
But what is the relationship between the two?
Since the column has been helping Ben, Boby Beer (Cry Milner Russell) has been moving slowly, but the column has recently been happy to see Ben's weakness, gentleness, and let's make a little dating.
tonight, Whitney, but better feel better than before going and back from vacation.
It is clear that she was very effective shortly after Walford's discovery that a person who was supposed to be a tragic wedding and a bride's husband was cheating.

If Yoshimoto's business is to bring '90 percent of gara', is it true to be a gift from a comedian?
It is a series of issues of Yoshimoto Kogyo, which caused the dark sales of antisocial forces, and the problem of gara is also closed.
President Akihiko Okamoto's meeting on July 22, said, "The company has no talent in 9 and there's nothing like that."
If the ratio of "9:1" is 90 percent, the view of investors who are considered to have a gift from comedians to Yoshimoto and pay taxes is also flowed on Twitter, with more than 30,000 repeaters.
If Galla's withdrawal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was asked by Yukinori Ando.
In the first place, the corporation is not subject to a donation tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of taxation.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual, it is not subject to the donation tax.
If the amount of work for 100 million yen was "9:1," Yoshimoto's sales amounted to ¥100 million and cost of ¥10 million.
This is the subject of corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax declarations and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you think about the distribution, you don't mean that the amount you actually receive is different from the original amount.
And I think the amount you received will be declared as sales.
The gift shall not be given as an individual if the player has not recognized it, since the act is firmly recognized by both sides.
Obviously, if you trade prices (e.g. real estate sales, etc.) at a price away from the original target of tax avoidance, it is a problem to calculate taxes.
However, as this time, the third party will not decide whether or not the appropriate price will be taxed against those who have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen payment book is a poison.
[Interview cooperation tax accountant] Yukio Ando After graduating from university, after working as a bank, he registered tax accountants in 2008.
University lecturers, seminars, and writing are extensive.
It is well known for easy-to-understand explanations for beginners.
the White House, the impeachment of the impeachment, the big panic.
White House officials said that Thursday, the new Democratic Party's impeachment pressure would be a leap forward, and the details of this issue explained that there was no plan to deal with the newly emerging reality, and this week's "big panic."
People close to the White House said that the appeal of internal accusations on the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have been increasing in concern, anxiety and anxiety about the possibility that the President and some peripherals could damage significantly.
He said, "I don't know what is happening."
The White House officials joked that there was no obvious plan on this situation, or the possibility that the President could not apply the usual measures that had been successfully involved in the matter before, so this claim was very serious, so there was no doubt about how to proceed, and that it would not be possible to cancel the news reported next.
Another person who is familiar with this dispute expressed the atmosphere in the White House, which has increased the alertness, as the President's response to the impeachment of this impeachment, and the possibility that the President will be "unnecessarily in hand" would increase.
Another concern is that during the hearing of the impeachment, the pressure of the President is expected to be raised every day, and some of the close associates of the President are expected to act as "imperial."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable behavior and concerns about the possibility of aggressive attacks on unexpected means, and is concerned about President and politics in the environment of elections.
Trump faced the greatest threat that had never been before in the presidential term, and revived the strategy that Robert Morler had judged himself effective during the Russian investigation.
Trump tried to take a look at the request of the President of Ukraine, who wanted to cooperate with the investigation of the political enemy, and was interested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the internal accusations as a motive for the factional conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the trial of Morler, but this time they began to feel the difference, they said.
Although he was a brand president, he seemed to have been in the press conference on Wednesday, and he said he was familiar with this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but was not in the heart of answering questions about Ukraine.
Internal accusations have been aware of the fact that President Trump, Vladimir Zerensky, and the fact that there was no direct information of the call with the President of Ukraine, are those who believe that damage can be mitigated by the fact that it undermines the credibility of the internal accused.
Furthermore, it is often happens when the President is attacked, but the momentum of the support layer increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic home close to the White House pointed out that the prime support rate of the President is already very high, and the effects of the impeachment of new supporters will not be much effect.
In particular, if the impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at 4-6 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the President for the last four months."
Other sources say that those who claim that impeachment could help the President have not fully grasped how much uncertainty the President's response will be.
White House officials are asked to advise advisors to organize an impeachment team.
According to the officials who explained the bones of the plan, this initiative is still in the early stage, but it is still unclear what kind of action will be done, such as the strategic decision room.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have clear leaders who can organize public relations activities in an aggressive manner to counter the momentum that the publication of organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, and the release of critical internal accusations and the public release of the Democratic Party's impeachment activities.
According to more information about this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspective is clearly visible, such as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Finance Steven Munewsin, who stated that it would not be possible to publish notes on the call with President Trump for 48 hours.
According to the person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the implementation of impeachment is called the external pitble of Trump, who served as head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwanduski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would become a leader in such efforts.
"For the past five years, I have come to all things that can help the President and the policy, but I don't have to talk with the President and close associates about participating in the team to counter this false impeachment."
Trump's external lawyer Jay Se Crow is also involved in impeachment efforts.
In response to NBC news coverage, Scorp said, "The problem is properly processed."
At the end of the investigation, Emet Fladd left the White House, teaching the White House until the end of the Mollah investigation, and Pat Ciporon, the current White House legal advisor, has little experience, and the White House currently has a lack of lawyers with experience of impeachment.
For more information on the White House strategy, the general public said that the parties are far from building a team for recruitment and strategic measures, but are organized and aware that all of them need human resources who can lead the total efforts and political struggle.

A couple who came to marry from distant love
C is in love with a boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also a word "the distance is tested and the two will be strong," but in the first place, do you have a long distance romance?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) The survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered, but according to the data, only 16% of couples were able to marry from distant love.
Since love is done using five senses, it is originally a relationship with looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice, holding hands (touching), smelling odors, kissing.
However, in the case of distant love, there are cases where you hear the voice on the phone.
It may be difficult to continue with hearing only in situations.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to the opponent's house, the time and effort will be burdened and the rest of the work is holiday to heal.
I feel comfortable when I go home.

Morikawa If you are a couple who can endure even if you don't often meet, or a couple who are determined in advance, I think it will work.
If you're engaged in one year or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you don't see the future position.

devin nenes, the Democratic Party condemns Trump's nude photo.
Devin Nunes, a California Republican, seems to be unable to bear the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, in a comment on defending the President, he accused the Democrats trying to get the president's nude photo.
Members of the House Information Special Committee voted at the beginning of a trial on internal charges that Trump requested to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The member said that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by leftists and media assets, and accused the Democratic Party to see the full naked photo of President.
"That's right, the Democratic Party of the Special Committee negotiated with the Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It is natural that everyone asks why the Democratic Party is so exciting to impeach the President, or that opportunity within a year.
After the dissolution of Nunes's scolding, a journalist in the Huff post, Jennifer Bend Delhi, decided to determine whether the Democratic Party would seek the truth.
The response was only to the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, but also to many other members, it is doubtful whether the answer is a red naked truth.
Medire Dotcom speculates that Nunes's nodist comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that were written in steel documents that were discussed.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking complaint against Trump, in one of the rooms in Moscow, where Trump is reflected in the view of the urine of the prostitutes, referring to the "Okko Tape."

In addition, while working with the Tourism Association to revitalize the region, he worked as a supporter.
The festival was held on 7 September in Aweina Osaka, Osaka, Osaka City.
the people involved in the group performed the representative song of Ogasawara.
There were about 140 people from Japan, including Mr. Naga Asahi, the head of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, and Mr. Yukie Ikebe, chairman of the Japan Music Festival.
In the ceremony, Mr. Yukie Ikebe greeted him.
While Mr. Ikebe said, "I can't believe that the teacher has died yet, while preparing for the "Requestion Ceremony," he felt how wonderful and great Mr. Miko Ogasawara was."
On the other hand, he said, "If you can do activities that can expand even a few meetings," he said.
After being dedicated to shutting down, Messe-ji, who was sent from Korea's Korea Art Exchange Association, Mr. Kenichi Okami, Director General of the Institute for International Studies of Chuchu thought, was introduced.
the potential to reduce emissions by renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles and Tesla trucks and semis have monopolized the news, it is only flying in the air, and it is said that renewable energy is not available.
However, professor at the University of Alberta developed technology to use renewable biofuels as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agriculture and Life Sciences, started the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid waste such as fat, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can be used to produce low-quality fats and carbon emissions are less than 85% lower than crude fuel.
This technology also affects the reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude fuel.
Dr. Bresler said, "This technology achieved in the first generation is the hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, traditional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems to move high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma," Dr. Bresler said.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory focuses on two options as a biofuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures, which have already been partially developed.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try the reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is high risk.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army investing in renewable options, Foji Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of the University of Alberta, is working on productization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes."
I would like to prepare a plan for the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmondton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $500 million from Lockheed Martin to $400 million in support of building a production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce around 1900 million litter biofuels annually.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the fuel transport method and production method do not increase the reduction rate.
"As a technical shop," says Bresler.
My job is to create an option to make multiple choices in parallel with the decision taken by the explanation.

Boris Johnson's camp warnings Britain faces riots like Los Angeles when Brexit is over.
If the second referendum covers the first outcome, there is a danger that "the fierce riots by the people" in this country would occur, and the senior minister said last night.
The Prime Minister's officials warned the British would face the yellowest movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that it was necessary to "depress anger" against political words that had been exchanged with severe excuses, but argued that the term "default" would not be used.
Despite the appeal of the Prime Minister to regain his calmness, some ministers said in Times: "In this country, there was never something like the dilemma of Gire Joene or the 1992 Los Angeles riot."
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country only because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best movement - they're encrypting mobile phones and organizing demonstrations, and then there's a few populist leaders who use dirty hands to scare people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when four white policemen who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King told the jury that they were not guilty.
In this year, the French anti-government demonstrations, wearing yellow vests, led to confusion and destruction in Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out the warning of Johnson in the House of Representatives, stating that if the British failed to withdraw from the EU, the credibility of the Japanese political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted for a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, the 100 million people are dissatisfied."
Even if the 99 percent of voters disagreed with the withdrawal, they would not give up by writing letters to the House of Representatives.
It's not time for thousands of people to repeat the streets.
A senior minister added that if the second referendum would cover the first outcome, there would be a danger that "a fierce riot by the public" would occur in this country.
Johnson, in the general election, asks voters to decide Brexit.
Johnson is reported to have faced a rebellion in the House of Representatives seeking to lower the demands on withdrawal from the EU and instead beat the EU with compromises.

Pakistani social media celebrities, brother of honor murder
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is often time-consuming until the execution of the sentence, while the accused murderers are compensated and the memory of the incident is reduced.
The women's rights activist, Farzana Bali, the first gender department of Pakistan's University, said, and added that even the Barrowch incident, which attracted attention, took more than three years to resolve.
Although it is difficult to prove reliable data, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission discovered at least 300 "religious murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the number of real honorable homicides is far more than that, but it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorary homicides occurring every year around the world are in Pakistan.
Countermeasures for pork cholera 1.3 billion yen to add to the September correction plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo! News

India, there are many regions where longing monsoon floods and big chaos occur.
The monsoon season in India is about a month long, with unprecedented rainfall, the buildings collapsed, and many crops have begun to rot.
Usually, Monsoon in northern India is weak in early September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, Monsoon will be weakened in the last few decades.
In many parts of India, there were still unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that the buildings were destroyed by heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
The house was flooded, and the residents crossed the street with water to kneel, usually seen at the peak of Monsoon.
There were heavy rains in other cities such as Corkata, Raluna, and Hyderabad.
In the northern Uttarakando state, there are significant damage to homes due to prolonged rain.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
In many regions, lack of water, farmers were preparing for the possibility of drought.
The longing monsoon for farmers is not desirable.
This rainfall is not common during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Bimtar, Uttarakand, said, "We are making cabbage, beans, peas, tomatoes, but vegetables are rotting in rain."
For consumers, too late, the price of onion that can not be found in Indian cuisine due to the influence of Monsoon, which does not weaken the power.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, the onion of 20 rubys per kilogram (23 pens) is usually sold at 80 rubys (about 1 pound).

The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the doll is made of paper, if Monsoon is long, it may be that the last laugh is Ravana.

exposure to large amounts of pesticides can increase risk of heart disease and heart attack
The latest research shows that working around pesticides in high concentrations can increase risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of tracking the Japanese-American kloops in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to a group of men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"This research highlights the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides in work, writing on medical records that contain pesticide exposure in work, and reducing the standard risk factor in heart disease," said Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez, co-author of the research.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii.
This is the result of the study of data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu, who participated in the Kiakini Honolulu Heart Program.
This research is aimed at only Japanese American men, so researchers may not apply to women or other races.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
This study saw the greatest impact within 10 years after exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important."
This is probably because the importance of other factors associated with aging population increases and hides the possible relationship between pesticides and mental diseases in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to pesticides in low and middle concentrations, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Zellensky, Trump's phone meeting, and Polochenko intervened.
The impeachment procedure for President Donald Trump was made, and the Washington political issue was a radical week.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners Vladimir Zerensky.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump phone problem?
At the beginning of the telephone meeting, Trump said that the U.S. is more convenient than other European countries.
Although the call recorded by the White House is not repeated, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the fact that the Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders were dedicated to speaking more concrete proposals.
The response of Zelensky, who opposed Trump 100% rather than 1000 percent, is considered controversial.
Zelensky added that both the President and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties discussed social media.
President Petro Poloschenko wrote on Twitter that "there is no prior support from the EU."
In addition, Polochenko tweeted that he was grateful to support the EU's sanctions and economic assistance during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Voguetica, said, "Is it possible to negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Then Trump asks for military assistance and asked Zelensky to take two surveys, not one, the first is to suggest that Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is the investigation of the servers of the Democratic National Committee, which was hacked during the 2016 elections.
It is unclear whether this would interfere with European relations, or whether the French and German leaders would put their backwaters on them.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
As a result of the announcement of the call, Zelensky said in the New York General Assembly.
Zelensky will meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the Nordic 4 Summit scheduled in October.

CBS Los Angeles - The police closed the illegal marijuana baying business in San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (BSLA) - The police closed illegal marijuana baying activities in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
In doubt of illegal marijuana pen-type Baip sales, the police began to care at 4:37 p.m. after the enforcement of the search warrant, and a large container was discovered at the office building in the 9600 block of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators found the equipment to pack the Baker cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
Captain Cano said that he had previously been involved in drug investigation, and that in the process of extracting oil used for Bayp products could be a fire.
"The static electricity from clothes can only be pulled out, and because it is concentrated, it will cause fire as well as explosions."
In addition, if there were multiple containers, it could not only explode one after another, but also burn the entire building.
The dangerous unit was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The price of seized goods and equipment was not immediately disclosed.
Anonymous information was received and the investigators said that it led to an investigation warrant on the site that discovered illegal activities.
The investigation is still in pursuit of who is the black curtain of illegal Bayp activities.
The police said that the office was empty, so he thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police said that, especially in the recent news related to the danger of packing, would like to tend to be illegal sleeping products and do not go out.
Captain Cano said, "It's really real, it's a substitute to buy without knowing."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have caused great harm to our community and children, so the police are constantly alerting people to avoid being close to these activities.

Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I.
It was woven with silver foil yarns made of the finest camlet silk, and the luxury embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was added.
Herstic Royal Palace dress collection curator, Erie Lin, refuses to be one.
The fallen piece of cloth, which was put on the wall of a small church in one country, is said to have been placed there 100 years ago, and is considered part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth I's clothing dance.
Three years after the discovery of this luxurious cloth, which was used as a church altar cloth in Helefordshire, three years later, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited near that room, in the Hampton Court Palace next month.
Other than the rest of the 16th century dress, it is revealed that it was an important discovery of the entire Royal dress collection.
Although Elizabeth did not have the perfect evidence of the dress through sleeves, he was convinced that the dress was not in place for the royal possession for three years.
An expensive fabric called "Gin yarn cloth" was prepared by the law only for senior members of the royal family, but it also suggests that the patterns of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later were noble.
At the time the dress was made, it seems that the price was equivalent to one house in the Tudor style.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen would be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rival wearing such luxury clothing would not be tolerated.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues.
We were always happy to hear that the cloth was amazing, and I was convinced that we were looking at one of the Royal Dresses."
A long second life of a dress used as an altar cloth in the Holy Face Church of Bactton, cut off, and not attached, seems to seem unexpected.
Bactton is a village from Brunswick Parley, who served as a female officer throughout the long life of Queen Elizabeth, and is said to have been associated with Paley for a long time.
The dress dates back to 1590 when Paley died, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, he must have come to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
Over 1000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and a very delicate hand sewn with thin surgical needles, the altar cloth will be exhibited next to Elizabeth's portrait, one of the most acclaimed contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition period.
The vast space as much as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries was only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, and the preservation work was done almost here, and Libby Thompson said, "I feel really respect for the artisans who made it."
When you look at the embroidered embroidered on the back of the table, you will be very respectful to those who made this.
I never seen this sophisticated work ever before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace on 12 October.
"The scope of the request has been searched and searched for," the Self-Defense Force withdrew for a week from the missing girl.
It's a week since the first year of elementary school girls are missing in the campground in Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Forces had no clues yet, and on 28th the search ended and withdrew.
A week after the first year of elementary school in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, the search for the 28th day began at 6 am.
However, the village requested to withdraw from the SDF as "the scope of the request was searched and searched," and the search for the SDF ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Force launched a total of 650 people, mainly on the mountain slopes and the dangerous places such as Sawa.
On the 27th, there was no way to find out the whereabouts of a 20-year-old man who participated in a search by volunteers.
Police and fire will continue to search from 6:30 AM on 29th.
Aggregation lawsuit against a single vote The first oral statement Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral statement of the trial was held at the Fukuoka High Court Miyazaki Branch, where voters were seeking to invalidate the election, as a result of a constitutional violation in July this year.
In the case of appeal, the plaintiffs sued the election invalidation as the value of one vote is 0.71 in Miyazaki Prefecture and 0.48 in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared with the lowest number of voters per member in July this year.
In the first oral theory of 27 days at the Fukuoka High Court Miyazaki Branch, the Plaintiff claimed that "the value of one vote was inequality and wrong."
On the other hand, the prefectural election committee on the defendant asked for a rejection of the claim as "not even though it was in a significant inequalities where the problem of deconstitution occurred, it should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on 30 October.
The meeting was held by the representatives.

A drone arrived at the space base and caught with a robot arm | Shizuoka Shimbun
No. 8 unmanned supply aircraft arrived at the International Space Station.
From the left, the robot arm of the station is growing.
The International Space Station (ISS) successfully caught the No. 8 spacecraft, and the JAXA staff who applauded (JAXA) = 28.
On the night of the 28th, the unmanned Air Force Research and Development Organization (JAXA) Unit 8 (JAXA), carrying supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) of about 400 kilometers, was arriving near the station.
The aircraft was launched 25 days from the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced by the control of the JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, it has no speed difference and approaches to about 10 meters.
The robot arm of the length of 17 and 6 meters is the flow that grabs the supplies.
The aircraft had about 5 or 3 tons of supplies.
After installation of the station, the flight attendants carry out luggage.
he was involved in a third of the u.s. domestic drugs
Shortly after the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug transactions.
Brian McQueen of the Drug Administration (DEA) revealed what was happening in the white daytime.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died in excess of drugs.
McNight said that 90 percent of drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king, Nemecio Selvantes, commonly known as El Mencho.
"Mencho is the top-ranked U.S. federal law enforcement agency," said Matthew DonahDEA executive officer in Mexico.
El Mencho's winnings reach $1 million.
With the help of Donahhe, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were hit.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisko Nueva, is involved in at least one third of drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, Cartel sold a large amount of cocaine, methane fetamine, and Fentanyl mixed heloin.
El Mencho's neck is worth $1 million.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California for 30 years, but was arrested and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel.
He owns a large amount of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
In fact, he also owns his own special maneuvers, and he said.
From the death of six Mexican Army helicopters to involvement in the public execution of the summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders have occurred due to the conflict of drug cartel.
According to the Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occurred on a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drugs are toxic, so they must wear protective clothing when handling.
At the manufacturing base, the seal of the dealer is pressed in the bag of cocaine.
More than one third is thought to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahhe said, "Mencho is involved in the inflow of harmful substances that effectively capture the lives of women and children without any sin."
In other words, when someone's child died, he said, "It's likely to be a drug brought from El Mencho's organization."
Over 67,000 Americans died last year.

Sony, Playstation 4 surprise news, PS4 game was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the contents of the PS4 limited edition of the Last of Part 2.
As part of the recent state-of-play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to Last of As.
Some of the exciting games of this new action game were presented to fans.
A few days later, the news of Last of As2 was published.
Sony and Noty Dog seem to return to the wind in various ways.
Since the time of PSwan, the Last of As Part 2 is released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Notydog Neil Doracman announced that the sequel evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense, the story is magnificent and complex," he said.
In this way, it was necessary to talk about a story with many characters.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolds, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it started and realized that all other sections started."
The game wasn't much spectacular, but it was two discs.
In addition, the last of the as part 2 contains one or two bad Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are open at work.
There is no limit to this surprise, but Easter Eggs in the game contain the works of nostalgic Noty Dogs.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 only on PS4, you will see more.
Those who have PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered with PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced the free PS4 game of Play Station Plus, including the aforementioned Noty Dogs.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including popular character Erie backpacks and bracelet replicas, and bonus versions with 12 inch figures.
The Notojima Mobile Sales Committee tried to encourage residents to continue (North Korea Newspaper) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of the island of Noto, Nanao City, where the aging population grew, the movement was started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council, which was created by residents.
In the trial until December, a wagon car with daily supplies, seasonings, and food went beyond the Suso-chokai and the semi-ura-chokai.
There were products that had been rapidly replenished by selling more than expected, and the residents asked them to continue saying "I am happy to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, garbage bags and detergents.
The total vegetables, such as potato salads, kinpagobo, are lined up at 100 yen and affordable prices to allow the elderly to eat.
In the Suso-chokai, people's columns were made, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akira Kikuchi of the Council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizuru Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping at his husband's driving, said, "I don't know when my father can drive, but I want to continue."
The user also received orders such as "Don't Coffee," but "I want you to put coffee on my own.
The Council shall consider what was requested.
At Noto Island, there are only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the Council tried to sell the goods to save the "shop weak."
From December to December, we will examine the 20-machikai in the island every month and whether it will continue as a business after the next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed the decision to add $1 billion to the affected population.
The cash support policy for farmers affected by droughts has been extended, and the existing farm benefits are greatly reviewed for simplicity.
In addition, approximately 34,000 million dollars will be recorded as a drought relief aid organization, and the target farmers will receive an emergency aid of $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-affected areas, each of the 13 municipalities will provide up to $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought prevention.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion as a drought support.
Ronald Lee Hasskel: A former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Hasskel (39) was convicted in the spring of Texas in 2014, killing four of Stephen and Katie State and five children.
The authorities stated that on July 9, 2014, Haskel was pushed into the residence of Stay and asked for the location of his wife Melannie Haskel.
Melney was absent, but his sister, Katie Stay and his family were.
Heskel fired and announced that Steven Stay (39) died of his 13-year-old and four-year-old son, nine-year-old daughter, and Harris County Police Department.
In his family, only one person, who was 15 years old at the time, was left alone.
At the time, the authorities reported that Kashmir was severely wounded, but then recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury dismissed allegations of innocence by Ronald Lee Haskel's heart loss.
The jury was dismissed from the monthly charges.
"If you choose to be disappointed, you will never forgive us."
What was the appeal of a girl who was shocked by anger?
Global warming is becoming more serious.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York City, Swedish 16-year-old environmental activist Gregta Tuunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
In addition to boycotting classes and sitting in front of the parliament, the school strike became a fire to spread around the world.
The young people who were intimidating anxiety and intimidation were protesting all over the world including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people from over 150 countries participated.
Morioka also set up a message board to march.
The threat of climate change is approaching.
The Paris Agreement, which started in 2020, aims to reduce the global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century, to less than twice as much as before the Industrial Revolution.
All participating countries, regardless of the distinction between developed countries and developing countries, shall take measures.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to the relationship between global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, follows various regions.
We need to strengthen our efforts to achieve a faster pace.
At the summit, which was realized by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, which strengthened the sense of crisis, the 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to make real zero by 50.
Other 70 countries raised their target for the time being.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which expressed the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not explicitly express their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emitters became apparent.
The criticism of Japan's strong coal-fired power generation is also strong.
In the long-term strategy of the government, as soon as possible in the latter half of the century, the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at the environmental-related meeting, said that he should work on fun, cool and sexy issues at the meeting.
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
I don't want to resist Mr. Gregory, who is now a symbol of environmental movement.
If you don't have any discussion, you will not be able to change the issue.
There is no longer a limit to global warming, and the international community must respond to the common crisis of humanity.
There is no need to be enough effective for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind him.
If you don't take that future, you should be an adult.
one step forward to quantum internet realization
The research results of the United States Army led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to secure military safety that was impossible for conventional network initiatives, and provide measurement and measurement functions.
According to the U.S. Army Research Institute's Distributed Quantum Information Center, which is funded by the U.S. Army Research Institute, Insbruck University researchers achieved record of quantum entangling transport between materials and light - 50 km from optical fiber cable.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangling state and one of them is measured, even if the other quantum bits are physically distant, the measurement results are affected by the other.
"This distance [50 km] is more than two digits, and it is a realistic distance to start building a quantum network between cities."
The intercity quantum network is composed of a network between physical quantum bits in the Entangle state despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this empowerment is absolutely essential to the establishment of the quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize a large distributed engagement," says Dr. Sarah Gamble, Deputy Secretary of the Army Program to support research.
In addition, the entangling at the exit through the fiber remains sufficient to meet the number of conditions required for some most difficult quantum network use.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and then excited until quantum information was released.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangling.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of the photon emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and it will soon be absorbed into the optical fiber cable," says Dr. Rañon.
The team then sent the light particles through nonlinear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, which is the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
After that, the photon was sent through a fiber optics cable 50 km long.
Despite the conversion of wavelengths, atoms and light particles remained entangling.
"The use of calcium atoms can capture calcium at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangling network in long-range atomic clocks.
The large entropy clock network is a very important field for the Army from precise positioning measurements, navigation methods, and measurement applications."
