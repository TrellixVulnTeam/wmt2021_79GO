Croatian nuclear treatment facility planning, Bosnians protest
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the town of northwest Bosnia and protested the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from its only nuclear power plant near the river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The protesters gathered in the town of Nova Grad strongly urged Croatia to abandon the plan to store the site of the barracks in Trugofska Gola, and to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant.
The Bosnian people, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," "The river requires us," said the nuclear waste disposal facility could threaten the lives of about 250,000 residents in the Una and surrounding areas.
We must oppose it.
The mayor of Novi Grado, Miloslav Dorika, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the rivers.
The Klusco nuclear power plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
The Croatian national broadcaster reported on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided to build its own storage facility or to pay for the amount of waste in Croatia that Slovenia would be treated at a newly constructed facility.
Mr. Tomislav Chorich, Minister of the Environment and Energy Affairs of Croatia, said that Croatia had problems in the disposal of public facilities from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wanted to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents in the country claimed that Croatia would search for another location on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket be the perfect place for the entire Croatia?"

Nigeria: Police enforcement investigation of the school, 300 children rescue.
Kaduna - The State Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
The police said that children were placed in an inhumane environment, but the school denied this claim.
The school's pastor, Chef, said, "The children are in school with parents' consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
They came to feed their children every day, so they know what kind of environment they are.
It was very surprised that the police came and evacuated the children, and the food that the parents delivered was all taken away.
This is an unfair treatment for parents who can test whether they had children in a terrible environment like police say."
He added that the former police headquarters Abdullahman had visited once to confirm what kind of environment the children were, but there was no complaint.
They also learn about Corran and say that it is.
However, the police spokesman Yakb Savo said that the children would be reunited after they were handed over to the state government.
"Instead of getting knowledge about Corran, they were placed in an inhuman environment.
Many children were injured on their back.
That's why we're investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Pope, AI development, is based on public profits and warns IT companies.
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, and investors that artificial intelligence development competition and other digital development would increase social injustice if they were not accompanied by public interest ethical evaluations.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met.
At the conference entitled "Public Interest in the Digital Age," a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions on the future and risk of artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of war technology and increased machinery work, and at the same time, examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch, New Zealand, and social media companies responding to the brutal video spill.
In his speech at the conference, Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines were released from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely on robot engineering to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances are causing increasingly prominent inequality, it is not true progress."
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will be able to reverse the state of a kind of barbarism based on the theory of the bull.
According to the organizers of the conference, we would like to use the expertise of the participants to find people who could be a future advisor to the Catholic Church in high-tech areas.

The accelerator pedal stop mistakes!
Four quick-moving devices that can be rearranged - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driving errors.
In particular, an increase in the number of accidents caused by brake and accelerator step mistake by older drivers.
In particular, when it comes to a hurry, it becomes a panic, and it can be said that the accelerator is on the brake pedal.
The new car is equipped with a safety driver support function that does not cover such driving errors, but there is also a rearing device that can be mounted on an unmounted vehicle.
After-sale parts manufacturers are developing and selling rapids and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what features each have.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALRM] The "e-ACCEL ALRM" developed by Pibott to inform the pedal step mistake from a new perspective.
The pedal's step mistake is to avoid using an alarm sound.
The mechanism causes " alarm sound" when you need more than stepping on the accelerator pedal when you stop or slow driving.
By reacting to the sound and prompting the accelerator to return, it avoids rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the step mistakes.
It is also effective for elderly drivers who are difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the accelerator step mistake.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the main body is attached on both sides.
The price is 9800 yen (tax excluded) and it is also attractive that the setting is necessary.
[Night Watching] The World Wing started its launch in mid-September, but the accelerator brake step-by-step fault prevention device "Do you watch it as well."
It is also possible to reverse (back) without advance.
At the time of the stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped down, the vehicle's vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and electrically suppresses the accelerator opening and suppresses rapid progress.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I didn't tell the signal from the accelerator and instantly control the advance by turning it into a creep running state (where the brake is separated by the D range).
At the time of retreat (back), we also detect the speed of about 5Km/h and have the ability to force the vehicle to switch to a cleaner state.
The mounting is only possible with caparion and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (tax excluded).

"There is no correct answer to the preparation, and the need for family configuration and housing changes."
Shinko Kawasaki (40) in Shiraishi-cho with a 6-year-old and 8-year-old child said, "The elementary school had an e-mail on the day before, but the nursery school also had no email system.
There were also requests to build systems that could be shared in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said that the weather had changed before, and "It was OK last time," and he said, "I want to take care of small ingenuity and connection with people and prepare for disasters."
Mr. Tanaka said, "The opinion that was issued is to convey the government as a group."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Curri to the police agency.
The Police Agency (IOPC) will examine whether or not Johnson should investigate the alleged scandal in London mayor's office in violation of the penal code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the "Acts on Acts" of the Prime Minister regarding the alleged suspicion that Archery had received preferential treatment from the friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
GLA says that there is information that indicates the possibility of a crime.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider if it is necessary to investigate this matter.
The problem was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC is an agency that corresponds to charges issued by police in England and Wales.
This was due to Johnson's position comparable to the police officer at that time.
Johnson denied fraud related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information about his relationship with the Archici.
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but in the press, the Americans who moved to London seven years ago, Johnson was paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the London mayor's period, and he was given preferential measures to join the foreign trade-related dispatchers with Johnson.
Since then, the government has frozen a grant of 100,000 pounds to the hackerhouse company in the survey.
The company will ask questions about the investigation process conducted before subsidies are paid.
In the House of Representatives, Mr. Matt Waman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said that the Digital Ministry has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns the British phone number.
However, according to a number of reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office, which is said to have been based on Mr. Archi (34).
The relationship between Prime Minister and female businessmen was "a secret between officials."
The movement of GLA, which attempts to entrust the Prime Minister to the police agency, touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
The government officials said that this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the day before the Conservative Party was "too party abbreviation."
"There was no evidence for any charges, and the Prime Minister had no opportunity to answer the director before the news announcement that was issued late on Friday."
The public and the media will see the political Kyogen that was organized by AMA.
As I mentioned earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that Johnson, who supported the London Tourism Promotion Division, and the friendship between California's businessmen were "public secrets."
The former staff of the London and Partners (L&P) said that despite the fact that he had believed that the company was "reliable" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany the foreign trade-related talks led by the Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund for ordinary living people to use for property formation!
Today's 20th anniversary of the Sunrise Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard the outlook for the future from Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Tsuwakami Nobunobu.
It celebrated its 20th anniversary in August this year.
What are you feeling now?
First, in the history of 20 years, there were many thoughts and efforts.
I would like to express my deep appreciation for all the people involved, not just the history that I played with.
Originally, it was the "Sawakami Fund" that stood up with the desire to support the formation of property for general living people.
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
If the general public solves the anxiety of money, the world will brighten up from the foundation.
In the long term, operations are not graded if they don't go along with beneficiaries.
At the time of the bursting of the Lehman shock and the bursting of the IT bubble, many money comes out.
I feel that we have been able to understand the message that we have stated since the time of our day.
The result is the reason why it became a long-term fund for 20 years, and it is because it continued to be a direct sales system to deliver messages directly to many people.
At the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just telling the results, information about what you're buying is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
mc Miller's death, the third drug arrester.
Los Angeles (AP) - Last year, Rapper's Mac Miller was arrested for drug crimes associated with the death of drug overdose.
According to the trial record, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit pills of oxycodon mixed with Fentanyl before Miller accidentally took over cocaine, alcohol and Fentanil, but Fentanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has been a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Pett, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a trial published on Tuesday, Pettyt had obtained drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Libis, who was arrested in Lake Habas City, Arizona at the beginning of this week, was accused of receiving drugs to Pettyt as a delivery agent for Walter.
All three are not directly charged with Miller's death, and there is still an anti-bent about individual cases.
Walter, currently in custody, was sentenced to five months in prison due to drug arrest in 2005.
On Thursday, the prosecutors in charge of the first issue reported by the celebrity website TMZ requested Walter to be detained until the trial began due to the high possibility of escape abroad.
There was no immediate reply to a lawyer's call message.
Pett was charged with federal courts on September 4, but the defenders refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics have a direct word about depression and drug use, and in the hip hop world he has won a fan as one of the Great Palaces.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, but was defeated in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram and published a song about the mirror, "Sanque Neckst."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died of opioid drug abuse in recent years.
The rock band's three-doors down guitarist Matthew Roberts died of excessive drug intake in 2016.
In this article, Walter's name was changed to Stephen instead of Steven.
More than 30 mobile games developed in Nigeria
This 9-year-old boy uses a free programming app called scratch2 to create a game of rubbish.
With scratch 2, you can create games, animations and stories on and offline.
Basil has made over 30 mobile games using this app.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats from hiding places.
He learned how to make a game in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN that he spent time making games when boring.
In March, his father applied for a short-term intensive course for children aged five to fifteen.
The course hosted by Code Fest International was introduced to children such as Basil to give them a chance to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in many mobile games.
"When I was four, I bought a tablet.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, at the age of seven, he was very interested in making the game.
"One day, I had a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got angry."
He said, "I'm always playing games, but how do I make a game myself so that others can play it?"
When I said, I was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basil, who has been interested in learning how to make his own games, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step of the game production.
Basil, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has a name in his game.
One of the games, "Moskite mash" can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is made, young people such as Basil have the leadership.
Recently, two of Nigeria's twelve-year-old children have been awarded a robot that uses the program code to separate housework.
In May 2019, a women's high school team in Ghana who programming boxed robots won the Robot Fest Contest.
Google and Microsoft's huge technology companies have increased African investment, and Basil-chan and the children of the same age become the future programming star.
the former chairman of the North Carolina Republicans, the false testimony of bribery.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to have false evidence against federal agents who conducted corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the list of federal court cases, Robin Hayes is convicted on Wednesday next week.
According to a document based on the fact that Hayes was prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes, Hayes was aware of false statements against FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the documents based on the facts are not specified in which sin is accepted.
Hayes was initially accused of conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return to special treatment, the prosecutor accused Hayes of being involved in the insurance company's heavy duty plan, which was to pay tribute to state insurance director.
Greg Lindberg and two co-owners were charged with attempted bribes to the Secretary of State Mike Cozy.
Lindberg is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $500 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported Republican principles and politicians, but also offered to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer called for a comment on Friday and e-mail, but did not reply.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the defendant's lawyer, asked E-mail to add comments.
The court documents submitted on Friday stated that Hayes had false statements on FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes did not speak with Corge about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to the facts, Hayes was actually talking about the recruitment of personnel from the State Insurance Director and the Insurance Bureau from Lindberg.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindberg's request that he would like to meet with Corge, and also spoke directly with the director.
In April, the prosecution announced that Lindberg would seek special treatment for his own insurance operations, and that it was intended to attract $200 million to the election campaign aimed at reelection in 2020.
According to the prosecution, the conspiracy involved a request for the replacement of the authorities who had examined the company in Lindberg.
Republican Corsey reported an attempted bribe to federal agents and helped them.
There is no doubt about Corsey.
In the case of prosecution, Lindberg's co-owners instructed Hayes to send $50,000 to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the prosecution, Hayes was initially opposed to taking care of the expensive money, but eventually broke out in the conversation.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes said, "What do you want?"
i know, i'll do it.
The Federal Prosecutors' Office of Public Prosecutors asked an e-mail to ask for more information about judicial transactions.
Facebook, aiming to improve the user's happiness!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's happiness, some users would like to post others soon!
This change followed by a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, so it seems!
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager Mia Garrick said that this change was based on feedback from mental health experts that would cause a number of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "There was a very positive feedback from many bully groups and mental health organizations working together."
It is only to remove numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of exchanges rather than the number of actions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick said that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., test the same way.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test ends.
"There were initially positive feedback about the experience in Instagram, but now it is a step to listen to feedback and learn."
Garrick, who is in Australia in the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very aggressive Facebook and Instagram user.
He thought Australia would be a great country to get really good feedback about whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

Self-resolved bag fittings to Otk! 【Cando】 " holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my mother's most favorite bag and I couldn't move anywhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to love it.
I helped him when I was in the hands of Cando.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, the neck is the ultimate pchipra.
Therefore, if you ask the store to repair it, the price of the main unit was significantly higher.
My mother said, "I'm not going to give up."
First, I went through the Home Center and looked for the replacement of this connected fixture.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was never seen at all.
I went to Candu and finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it in the handicraft corner.
It's 100 percent as expected.
It is originally a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
It was planned to use one by one on both ends of the bag handle and bought two pieces.
The size of the ring is small, but if you put the bag fittings on one side left, make the same at all!
This opens the way to repair the bag.
It is a tight mounting.
what is it?
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outside.
I attached it to the bag.
I feel the color of the gold system is good♪ However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor ...
Therefore, I tried to make a ring with two formulas.
The number of metal fittings increased, but due to lighter parts, the weight is no problem.
Rather, I feel that the number of cracked parts increased and the design level was improved.

his brother's life imprisonment with social media star in pakistan.
Dr. Candy Barrought, a photo of social media posted, was hanged in July 2016.
Mr. Candy Barach, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday, and sentenced to imprisonment with the most attention of his father, state Pakistan.
In July 2016, Balochi, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, was hanged.
He was arrested by his older brother, Hamand eagle.
A few days later, in a press conference, he said that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and did not regret what he did.
Mr. Saldar Memoud, a lawyer, told AFP that the Court of Murtan in the eastern city was convicted and sentenced to life in a judgment awaited.
He said, "I will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Balochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that his son wanted to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
I am my daughter and my son."
Burrought's murder became a major news all over the world, and as a result of his father's rights, most of the victims were killed and the so-called "religious murders."
In the case of Mr. Barrought, who chooses his own marriage partner, he praised his sexuality and committed suicide in crimes such as shameful family.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
Later, in Pakistan's Kisars and Deyas (retribution) law, the perpetrators can be forgiven from their relatives.
Three months after his death, Congress passed a new bill that required life imprisonment for honoring murders.
However, the killer is still in charge of the judge's discretion, and the killer can claim another motive in theory and may be pardoned.
In the case of Mr. Balochi, his parents initially insisted not to forgive his son.
However, when he lost his son, his sad parents changed their thoughts and asked him to forgive his son.
In response to international hatred for the murder, the Pakistani government took unprecedented measures to declare the country as a successor with their parents.
His famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket Team and wearing a straight red dress that opened widely on Valentine's Day.
Although criticized and threatened, it was recognized by many people, including young people, when the new heaven and earth opened in a country where it was regarded as a bold and political activity to improve the status of women.
The origins of the "principal" murder are ethnic social norms, and still remain widely in South Asia, especially in women's actions, but men may be victims.
To donate 1,600 units and storage boxes to the affected areas, cold sheets and disaster areas | Yamagata Shimbun
In Tsuruoka City, a cold sheet box was installed at the old Jukuseki Chu Ground.
In response to the earthquake in June, the Yamagata Shimbun donated the four autonomous groups in Tsuruoka City, which had been affected by the earthquake.
In preparation for the tsunami, you will be placed in the coastal areas such as the "1st evacuation place."
On February 2, a ceremony was held at the "Old Juseki Chu Ground" in the first evacuation place in the area.
It was damaged by earthquakes in Tsuruoka City, which concluded a partnership agreement, and a cold sheet was donated to the nearest municipal association in the temperate region.
The recipient of the donation is Koiwa-gawa River (500 pieces, two storage boxes) Shoda (300 items, one storage box) and Muguke Seki (400 storage boxes) - each autonomy association.
When the earthquake occurred, many residents of the coast of the Sea of Japan were alerted and evacuated.
In the city of Tsuruoka, they fled to the first evacuation site where they were set up in high numbers in each village.
The large tsunami did not occur, and most evacuationers returned home without moving to a well-equipped secondary evacuation site, but many of the first evacuation sites were asked to appeal to the cold because of the outdoors.
As a result of similar disasters, countermeasures against severe cold and wind rain were one of the challenges.
A sheet that can cover the whole body during evacuation can cause cold and wind rain.
there is also a thermal insulation function in the world of flame.
The seat is about 1.3 meters x 2.1 meters, and it becomes a pocket size of 9 cm × 12 cm when folded.
The four-layer structure uses gold, silver, and back to cover the body.

(From left) ASA Amami Sports Academy
[ASA Amami Sports Academy, NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira INODA, Amami City) and ELOVE (President Junya Maeda, Chinamachi) signed a partnership with the Ministry of Education and Sports Promotion.
In addition to actively collaborating in projects conducted by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we also set up a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injuries, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
Both organizations send exclusive trainers, instructors, and information sharing when training related to sports.
When a team of remote islands travels outside the island, they will also try to solve problems such as the trainers are hard to compete.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in cooperation with the prefectural competitions and other national competitions, we support the reduction of performance of the players due to the fatigue of ship trips and stay.
In addition, during the tournament held on Amami Oshima and Okinagarabe Island, they cooperated with local recoil schools and hospitals to support players from outside the island.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held in Elabko, Chinamachi, where both Mr. Noda and Maeda exchanged hands.

Kenichiro MAKI "Now, traditional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Shigeki has been thinking twice about "mote."
The brain science mote theory is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge.
Then we will send you a piece.
In the previous section (see related article), Moteno Otoko firmly adheres to the traditional "male fantasy" and the pattern learning to make it is overwhelming!
Later, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad man and become a cool man.
i'm going to live with you.
In the first part, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and people's behavior.
When I learn patterns, I think that the brain will be structured so that it can live in a rake.
I think I'm still evolving every day as if I'm "mote."
That's why we live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and the Tokyo University of the Arts, I had a lot of conversations with young people.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor, it might be a bit painful if you're stuck in the old pattern that says, "The teacher at the university has more dignity."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say, "What should I do?" or "What should I do?" you will live.
Because people and society change even if they don't change.
I talked about that in my recent talk book, "No matter how terrible the world is."
It is something that naturally comes out with the recognition of the people around him.
I don't think he's not like that.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
Isn't you doing it at Cannes Film Festival?
Although he was light, he would be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record have no need to act greatly.
In other words, you can't make it lighter if you're bound to "thinkness."
As long as I heard a lot of women, I would like to be saved by any man, regardless of position or age.
It is difficult to say that this is cute.
what is it? (laughter)
In the northwest of Nigeria, in the illegal state, doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the announcement of the United Nations on Friday, the number of refugees from northern Nigeria doubled by about 40,000 due to the intensifying violence in this four months.
According to the UN refugee organization, the "new humanitarian crisis" was created by this confusion, and by the end of this year, each institution will work together to fund $35.5 million.
The UNHCR's Barbar Barrok spokesman said that the Islamic extremist Bokohalam, who has been active in the northern part of Nigeria for ten years, is unrelated to several recent armed attacks.
In the past ten months, violent acts in Sokot, Zamfala, and Kazina were organized by armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," said Barrok on Friday.
The kidnappers, tortures, assaults, murders and sexual violence are frequent, and the attackers are working to destroy their homes and theft.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokohalam and the West African branch of Islamic State, which was split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with the name of the group," says Barrok.
What they carry is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Nigers.
In the statement, UNHCR announced that the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the next few months.
the new trial date for men killed two women and children is confirmed.

According to the Pork County Court records, Marvin Escorbal Orillana (31) was prosecuted for the first-class murders in three cases, a false name named Marvin Esquibel Ropez, who was initially admitted by the authorities.
He claims to be innocent.
According to the police, on 16 July, in a demo-in house, he shot Rossives Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and son (5).
In court records, a new date of trial will be determined on January 27, and the time will be given to both plaintiffs and defendants.
According to the U.S. Immigration Bureau, Escobal Orillana was illegally staying in the United States and was forced to return twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal entry into the United States in 2010.
The Sonet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising on header bindings under the LFP.
LFP provides services that meet the needs of advertisers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks.
The service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
header billing is a mechanism that allows the media to deliver high-priced ads to media operated by multiple vendors (advertisers).
As a solution for media companies that are transparent and expected to improve profits, the introduction of large media is progressing.
Until now, SSP has been provided with advertising frameworks.
In recent years, in response to the request of advertisers, "I want to deliver to a particular advertising framework with a high affinity with individual commercials and brand images," LFP was launched in December last year by collaboration with media companies to directly purchase advertising frameworks.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header bindings can directly participate in bids for header bindings, and the opportunity to deliver ads is expected.
In addition, due to limited media coverage, the advertising framework for the delivery of individual goods and brand images is secured, preventing brand value damage.
The benefit of media companies is that it is possible to work closely with the hope of introducing media companies through a solution that bundles and manages the code of Bedder companies called "Lapper Solutions."

Two months later, Assistant Professor Yamagata stopped at Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that he would suspend an assistant professor at the Yonezawa Campus for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Department of General Affairs of the University of Tokyo, in October 2017, when he was teaching multiple students in the laboratory, he was emotional and repeatedly sued by inappropriate words.
He was a professor of education and was recognized to have deteriorated the school environment.
There were several students in the survey conducted in September 1818.
In December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistants, and in December of the same year, he conducted a survey of harassment prevention measures by faculty members at the Yonezawa Campus, and finally filed harassment from one student.
In response to the findings from the committee, President Koyama and the Board of Directors decided to punish them.

The Sun Paper Requests Mr. Boris Johnson to reduce the EU withdrawal request and make a compromise with the EU.
Now, only three weeks after the EU summit, which is a settlement, there is a growing concern around the prime minister that the prime minister might not be able to take a significant concession.
Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion in the Cabinet that seeks to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and to bring compromise with the EU.
The negotiations over a new tariff system, which replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "operable."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by the German Prime Minister Angela Merkel will propose compromises such as establishing a three-year time limit on backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers, who were preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the Conservatives' annual meeting in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the " radical" strategy that threatens the EU with unconstitutional withdrawals created by the senior advisor Dominique Camings, and urge the EU to accept the offer of restrictive time.
One of the Ministers said that the ruling that the Supreme Court held on Tuesday was "the police bell," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House, and they are against us.
The Prime Minister must use what can be used by step.
It is not effective even in extremes, and the plan of Camations is obviously unsuccessful.
It is not possible to fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised Johnson to run an agreement with Prime Minister Terry the May.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, we will talk to Bolis to return Terryza's agreement to the House."
That's why we're all together and everyone's trying to end this.
If we don't postpone it, Boris is over and we're all over.
John Mayer blamed Boris for not seriously considering negotiations.
The leader of the Conservative Party said, "The prime minister wants to connect with the EU.
However, we do not look at the fact that the Prime Minister has decided to establish an agreement with the EU.
Instead, we saw the Prime Minister in Scotland fighting the bulls, inspecting eggs in Ureez, and discussing with the people on the streets.
The prime minister admitted that the agreement was still a long time ago yesterday, saying, "If no one wants to achieve the goal, the way is still long."
However, the press also stated that the bill to force a three-month delay in the absence of an agreement would significantly weaken the position of our negotiations in Brussels.
The press said, "It is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are trying to make progress hard despite the fact that the bill was enacted."
The European Union withdrawal minister Stephen Barclay returns to Brussels today to further discuss with Michel Barnier of the EU.
They discuss how the regulation of all Irish islands on food and livestock is functioning.
Lorraine Kelly: The Glasgow accent told me that it would never be a success in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, revealed that he was told by the TV station boss that he would never succeed.
Before appearing in the television screen for the first time, Kelly, who was 59 years old, recalled the 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I worked as a surveyor at the BBC Scottish branch and told my boss that he would not succeed in the absolute television industry in your Glasgow accent.
Before he took over the Glasgow office, he went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewed by legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as a living legend.
I found my place here.
Kelly began working as a local newspaper reporter in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a TV-am Scottish reporter in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as host of the show on GMTV, ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and later began to show her name.
To celebrate the 35th anniversary, Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews were broadcast.
He added that passion, enthusiasm, and curiosity were the key to survival in the television industry, and that the moderator said, "I have to put it into work."
It must be honest and sincere.
I am interested in various people and interested in them.
Looking back on the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that it was "very spicy."
The day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, we didn't want to see a lot of children who were killed or wounded.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna's daughter, personally told me to meet me, so we talked for hours at her house.
I went to Joanna's funeral and Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McKan's daughter Madley were missing, saying that it was "very hard" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the harsh nets that don't know what's going on in their beloved daughter.
The couple won't really be poisoned.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, fear of traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga denied the offer of President Robert Mugabe, who was in the midst of a political change, due to the anxiety that it might be a trap to follow military action in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the Defence Forces continued, and Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give the President's office last week.
However, the reason why Chiwenga refused the offer was that he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders of the world and the African Union that he was deprived of the government in a coup rather than anxiety.
It is said that in a series of Twitters that the authorities confirmed that they were senior officials of the Cabinet Office, Mugabe, who had held the administration for 37 years, was not willing to give the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munangagwa, and that intense negotiations were held at that time.
Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, told the government officials that he had made contact with the envoy Chiwenga.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military headquarters and the former president was carried out by three.
George Charanba, president of Spokesman, and his senior officials were involved in negotiations by Aaron Nepela and the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonoli.
Gideon Gono, former president of the Zimbabwe Preparatory Bank, was the one commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to commander Chiwenga.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, failed to attempt to blame the African Union for military action while seeking intervention by African leaders.
The offer of the former CDF (the commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of former presidents.
"Some of the late president's family began to fatigue, and it was a wasteful action to save the rapidly expanding situation."
However, at least diplomacy alone had a little political goal of the late president.
If you want to destroy the constitutional order, you would have to clash with the views of the African Union on the coup, but the commander would remind you that it was not going to break the constitutional order.
President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top of the military at the time, would trap and destroy the claims of commanders who insisted not break the constitutional order.
The late president (Mugabe) wanted the African Union to decide whether to position as a coup without fully grasping the entire situation, but ultimately to be considered valid for military intervention.
It was intended and calculated at the bottom of the offer.
When he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces, Mugabe was moving, and officials speak.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe had to write his resignation.
The commanders of the army told Mugabe that even if they invaded the president's house, they would not turn guns to citizens.
At that point, Mugabe wanted two things to protect his family and to prove the power of the military.
The commanders and commanders at that time read exactly their intentions.
The word "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa" (which we belong to the military department) was used to describe a powerful metaphor for political competition without politicians.
The Army told the local commanders that the purpose of the military was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" surrounding him.
In order to discuss the coups and successors, Mugabe sought to return to South Africa with the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the South African Development Community at that time, it was clear that the South Africans would immediately be sent to Harare, as the key Africans refused to intervene, but threatened repeatedly behind them.
"Just because it was not supported by Putin and African leaders, it was not possible to achieve this," he said.
The ratification of the treaty in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
【New York】On the 26th of the United Nations Headquarters in New York, a meeting was held to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.
On this day, five new countries ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratified it into 32 countries and regions.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were held in accordance with the International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons on the 26th of the United Nations.
In recent years, Secretary-General Guterres also expressed strong concern over nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"We're not going to eliminate it."
China needs strong leadership, and if it doesn't matter, the collapse of policy documents
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday before the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In the White Paper, China's State Council said that the Communist Party took the government 70 years ago and that the success of the party was due to leadership.
China is vast, and domestic affairs are complex, but there are few political problems.
If there is no unified leadership, China will go to division and collapse and become a disaster for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing issues in a rigid manner, as it is necessary for national stability.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the second largest economic power, held the government in late 2012.
He also directed a military modernization program that threatened the region.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development model, nor does it intend to adopt a model of other countries, but merely seek peace.
Among the genes of the Chinese people, there is no invasion or world control.
In modern times, China was bullied from a column, and war and confusion left a deep scar with its pain; China would never be able to bear the pain that he experienced.
China is faced with difficult problems such as economic stagnation and anti-government movements in Hong Kong, China, which are difficult to cope with the severe trade war with the United States.
It is said that China will never abandon its core interests and will not allow the loss of security and sovereignty.
"There is no problem with the threat of trade war and the tariff that continues to rise."
China is a mature economic nation with the momentum of complete industrial systems, full industrial chains, wide market space and strong economic development.
"It never weakened in the trade war."
I am confident that China has the power to turn crisis into opportunities and open a new world.
Since China does not have any idea to counter the US and does not want to replace the US, the United States should calmly grasp the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is also possible to stop China's development.
The United States would not maintain its strength if it would suppress, suppress, suppress, and move the domestic contradictions abroad.

The Spice Girls' MelC, a diet disorder, and the family banned diet topics.
The Spice Girls' melanie Chizom admitted that they banned diets at home from the experience of fighting their own eating disorders, which had not eaten any fruit and vegetables for many years.
The sporty spices have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders for many years under pressure from members of the global pop group.

Hokkaido Shimbun: How about the Shin-electron edition
In the case of a conflict between marriage and marriage, the Utsunomiya District Court Maoka Branch recognized this.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize the same sex marriage, and there is no legal effect in Japan.
The decision was made to determine the fact of marriage between two women.
It is considered to be the first judicial decision to have legal protection against the same sex couples.
In the case of non-constitutional marriage due to the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Register Act, there are five lawsuits in Sapporo and other prefectures.
In order to overcome the ruling, I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights of sexual minorities and discuss the legal system of accepting diverse families.
Females lived in the United States for about seven years and received a marriage certificate in the United States, but the plaintiffs sought compensation for their former partners.
The decision was certified as "the reality of marriage between men and women" due to the results of living together.
It is a revolutionary decision to expand the recognition of marriage with the right to comply with social insurance.
More importantly, the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of which marriage is based solely on the agreement between sex.
At the time of the establishment, both sexes were not expected, so they were not resolved to deny the marriage.
"The Constitution is not supposed to be a sexual marriage," but it is expected to be a driving force for the same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, since the marriage was not permitted, the problem was that the amount of compensation was reduced as "the benefits of legal protection between men and women differ."
While recognizing the same situation as between men and women, it is not possible to distinguish the rights to protect them.
According to the National Family Trend Survey for married women, about 70% of people who were supposed to be admitted by law have changed their consciousness.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, the law is bound by traditional family statues, and it will take away the rights of people who are not fit.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" who admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and lack of joint custody.
In consideration of marriage, it is necessary to review family laws from various perspectives, such as not only marriage between sex, but also the expansion of legal rights of marriage.

<New Sports on September 27
it's a serious pollution of popular tourist spots, and it's obviously a video.
Among Sydney's tourism resources that bring $210 million annually to the Australian economy, Sydney Harbour is the largest producer of opera houses, thermal keys, Luna Park, and the famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is a ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 cups of pollutants flow every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest attractions is one of the most dirty places.
According to the new video of the title, from Sydney Harbour to the bottom, the waterways around Australia's most popular cities often flow into sucks, plastic bags and plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone had lost, and even animal dead bodies - everything flows into Sydney Harbour by rainwater.
Among them, the biggest factor in cutting waterways is plastic.
Dr. Catherine Dufont, Vice President of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, published on September 27 of the World Tourism Day, said, "This is a paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but one of Japan's coastlines is quite modified and polluted.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"There were several terrible heavy rains, but after that, Sydney Harbour was pretty tragic."
Two-thirds of the pollution flowed from rainwater.
However, it is like a part of the iceberg, and there is a greater problem that 70 percent of plastics flowing into the ocean are deposited in the ocean.
"I really don't know what the truth is if I don't go down the sea level," said David Center Manley, owner and owner Richard Nichols, who will recover plastic waste of about 500 kilograms each year alone.
If a lot of people know more (what is there under the water surface), I think everyone is really cool.
It is overwhelming, but more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
The remaining half is used in plastics at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and it is unbelievable that all plastics and garbage flows down the water immediately.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders of Ocean Protect, said that local residents may also be able to reduce plastics and waste flowing into the waterways.
he says, he should start from the source of origin.
We need to focus more on reducing the use of plastics, recycling more well, and finally flowing into the sea.
The 50 percent of oxygen we suck comes from the ocean, and the pain of the ocean will kill ourselves.
Oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
However, we will repair Sydney Harbour and return to the old scene, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing humans.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also announced in this month, as part of the activities of Australian citizens to widely know about environmental protection and the reduction of the effects of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of the 546 children aged 12 to 18 have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is an adult.
In this study, the problem of plastic waste was ranked fourth in concern for parents, and 93 percent of the respondents surveyed felt increasingly anxious about the amount of plastic waste in the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.

It is said to have negotiated with the city's tourist facilities to sell goods.

My father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I don't know what I'm doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to get my mind, and even as a working man.
When I was told to be a television announcer at the end of my efforts, I was told to be a TV station announcer, and when I was hurt, my father said, "I didn't think it was a 'coon'.
At the time of the second and third year of the company, when I joined the company, I had only a job called "Anyone who is empty is good," and when I was not motivated by what I wanted to do, my mind was rotten.
i learned naturally from my father's play.
There may be a lot of people who have never seen the news, but in fact, after joining the TV station, I have been in touch with the news all over the years.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko Deluxe praised it as "very good to read the news of Mama."
When reading news, what I feel is important, sense is "between."
It has been cultivated by watching his father's stage, film, television, and drama during his childhood.
In other words, I think that it is thanks to my father because there are many experiences of my childhood.

In this study, some cancer cells in humans and bags used a series of proteins called PRC2 to prevent markers from reacting and immune systems from attacking cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and skin cancer called Merkel cells.
Prof. Mark Doson, a researcher at Peter McClell, said, "The very important thing in this project is that we might be able to reverse the process for patients who have shown resistance to immunotherapy."
It is possible that the immune system can identify cancer cells by reusing conventional therapies and revitalizing markers, which are known as MHC.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Doson said.
"The lung cancer is an epidemic in the world.
And treatment may be much better.
Researchers expect this discovery to ultimately be used to treat the face-to-face tumors of Tasmaniadeville, where cancer cells escape detection.
"It's surprising that the same process will happen at all (to the gun of human and Tasmaniadeville).
"It was so hard to treat Tusmaniadeville tumors.
However, if a drug that is effective for humans can be used in Tasmaniadeville, it may help control the tumor."
scientists are also puzzled by giant planets orbiting polar stars.
Scientists have discovered the solar system that covers the current understanding of planetary formation by orbiting a giant Jupiter-like planet around a small star called red dwarf in the distance of 30 light years from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of a giant gas planet GJ3512b was released around the red dwarf.
The star is usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around it.
However, in this case, there is no difference in the size of stars and planets, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"That's another surprise," said Juan Carlos Morales, an astronomical physicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Sciences, who led this research into science.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets like Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gases like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Color Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star around 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only much smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, the surface temperature is much lower than the Sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800.
That's why I'm red."
On the other hand, while the second planet orbits the star, the third planet may have been released from its star system in the past.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gases and dust that produce stars that orbit themselves.
The most powerful planetary formation model, known as the "core integrated" model, causes objects from solid particles in the disk, resulting in the atmosphere by pulling the eggs of the planet.
This unusual planetary system may be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the primordial disk surrounding the star may be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature was lower."
Since the disk becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses may grow until they collapse and form planets.
i'd like to eat a soy dip with a delicate employee and a wakeer.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is accused of eating beans with wake-up to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Animina Hernandes (38) was accused of transferring methane fetamine and taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident occurred at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to the estimate of the oath issued by OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked him to make a little taste because Medina Hernández saw making beans dip.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane fetamine before, "I thought it was strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach was poor and her legs were fluffy.
According to Albany Democrat Herald, a local hospital where women went was judged to have had methane fetamine mixed in beans.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said that Medina Hernández had told the victim's food that "the drug was put," while the third employee told the police that he had sent a message that the suspect had accidentally put methane fetamine into beans.
According to the Oregon Live article, it is said that the surveillance video captured by Deli has taken out something from the Brager, although Medina Hernández is pointing back to the camera and behind the microwave.
After that, it is said that he lifted up his nose and walked toward the table to put the beans dip in a small paper plate.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff has not thought that there are customers who have been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was imprisoned in Marion County instead of $52 million.
According to the Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of assaults, robbery, suffrage, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Linear Oigawa Problem "Enable Challenges" President of JR Tokai and Head of Early Construction | Shizuoka Shimbun
At the press conference on 27th, Mr. Kinko Kinko, President of JR Tokai, commented on the issue of the Oigawa flow reduction due to the construction of the Line Chuo Shinkansen Minami Alps Tunnel, and that the issue of the meeting with Shizuoka Prefecture should be divided into two issues before starting construction and that it should be necessary to separate the project from the start of construction.
In particular, he kept talking about the meeting place and the previous stage.
"We don't think it's possible to separate such issues," Kim said.
On the other hand, he said, "We have to talk about our thoughts.

5 Medical institutions in Saga Prefecture | The Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun
According to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, five public medical institutions in Saga Prefecture announced the name of the hospital on June 26.
The population of 13 medical institutions in the prefecture is 38 and 5%, which is the tenth highest in the country, and three have already been integrated and transferred.
The official name of the hospital in the prefecture was Higashi Saga Hospital (Mikiki Town, Mie Prefecture), Takyu Municipal Hospital (Chikyu City), Kojo Citizen Hospital (Kojo City), Imari Matsuura Hospital (Imari City), and Tayoshi Town Hospital in Fujitsu County.
In addition, the Imari Matsuura Hospital has decided to relocate to Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture.
Taira Hospital is the center of comprehensive care in the town and has been operating surplus in recent years.
Takayuki Nagabuchi stressed that "the town itself operates alone and has a view to collaborating with the neighboring city's hospitals, and hospitals have to leave absolutely for the residents," and expressed negative views on reorganization and integration.
The Director of the Office of the Higashi Saga Hospital stated that he would not listen to the contents from the prefecture, and that he would actively participate in the Regional Medical Planning Coordination Conference in the prefecture and respond to the purpose of the discussion.
The Regional Medical Function Promotion Organization (Tokyo), which operates Imari Matsuura Hospital, said, "The announcement is not mechanically determined by the direction of public hospitals, but it is said that it was requested to consider again at the Regional Medical Planning Conference in each prefecture."
"I would like to listen carefully to the parties about the future hospital operation."

In addition to these five, five of Cocker Spaniel's bists, oxo, flash, picks, and spans were added, as well as four ciders, berry Balkans, and candy.
The staff on the royal private aircraft will be busy.
The royal staff had been witnessing that they had left the dog on the grass before boarding, and asked them to take care of them.
I've never been in an accident before.

It is often understood that it is roughly equivalent to two large elephants.
However, it is not the queen who loves fashion.
The wife of the Marquis of Cambridge is also said to have their own taste when carrying their clothes.

Michelle Obama, instagram, praised megan markle as inspiration.
Michele Obama highly appreciated Megan Markle on Thursday in a favorable Instagram, and the Duke of Sassex called him "a thoughtful leader who would break the type and better the world."
During his 10-day visit to South Africa with his son Arche Harrison Mountbatten-Winzer, he attended the reception of young people and met with the executive of the Obama Foundation.
Former President's wife wrote a very favorable post, saying, "It is a thoughtful leader who breaks the old customs and makes the world better, thanks to the Queen of Sasex, my friend."
Obama's wife posted a photo of Mrs. Megan, who poses with the Foundation's executive, adding that "Even with the Obama Foundation's interview, the support of girls around the world who seek appropriate education is stimulated by many people."
Her former actress, Magan, served as guest editor in the September issue of Vogue magazine, and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In a direct conversation, former President Mrs. Motonaga noted how her mother and mother changed her.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "It's like being a mother is in an advanced class to let go."
My job was almost always as my mother to find out what children want to do and keep the proper distance to grow.
In order to find out who they are, in essence, are not the ideals of children as parents and their childhood aspirations.
Obama's wife, who actually knows the pressure on spot lights in the world, advised her little by little by little by little in the interview of Good Housekeeping magazine.
Sometimes the pressure from myself and people around me can feel too large.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't have time to do anything.
In the first few months in the White House, instead of starting to work ambitiously, the girls began to live in school well, and the new friends were distracted.
I think it's better, but rather good.

Trump Hotel owner's right complaint, liquor sales license is held.
Washington (AP) - The United States Department of Alcohol and Beverage in Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel, as the owner's right-of-the-job.
The committee filed a complaint with three members, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders on Wednesday, and most of the petitioners had no fixed assets in Washington State or the state.
According to the Washington Post, it is the second time that an appeal to the cancellation of the right to provide alcohol at the same hotel is based on the state law that requires the applicant's "suitability."
In the first appeal submitted in the summer of last year, he repeatedly accused Trump of assault and violated the state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already accepted.
This was the second time that the license was renewed.
The honey bees collected by betray's honey bees are harvested first!
How about the taste of honey collected by flying bees that are bred on the b knee?
In May 2019, a set-up bee was started on the site of the UK Bentley Crew Plant, and the first honey was harvested in September of the same year.
The members of the crew who worked at the Crew Factory gathered more than 100 bees from only two nests.
Why did Bentley begin to feed on the factory grounds that assemble cars?
I want to taste this!
Here are the bees that Bentley works.
Peter Bosch, director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to biodiversity conservation in the region, we established a nest for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant.
From wildflowers planted on the site and wild mountains around the area, the beekeepers watched how the honey bees are gathering.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful that there is so much harvest in the first year.
Through the Crew Plant and our business, Bentley has been working on a wide range of activities as much as possible to the top of sustainable luxury car manufacturers.
The staff are actively cooperating.
It is very nice to have the first harvest successfully, and next year we have more nests and plans to increase the amount of bees harvested in Bentley.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives in order to play our own role."In May 2019, 12 million honeybees started.
And in September of the same year, after the summer of the same year, it was completed to remove the nest from the nest box and filter the bees that were dropped by dripping.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen as Bentley's specialty.
The design of the label was directed by Louise Mass column, a designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only delivered to the staff but also given gifts to customers and customers who are important to visit the crew factory.
The UK is a country that values tea time.
We want to enjoy afternoon tea, not only Fennerty, which is compatible with honey, but also the bees of FlyingBees, etc.
it's the worst in the UK with the Cleveland Police and the fraud report.
As a result, the police were arrested by the British government for the worst.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud in all areas inappropriately.
In the Cleveland Police, Phil Gomley of the Police Department continues to be "a serious deterioration."
The police have replaced five police officers in six years, and now they are facing new demands for demolition.
According to the report, he failed to stop the crime, arrest the suspect and defend the vulnerable.
Phil Gomley of the Police Bureau said, "We have continued to make a significant deterioration in our last investigation."
The police chief Mike Vyll resigned in January less than a year of office, but he was investigating his actions as "a serious" but several unpublished charges.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was arrested for serious illegal acts and suspended.
Captain Simon Harwood, who was in charge of sexual activity last year, went to an illegal investigation committee.
He resigned from the police.
The Conservative mayor of Teas Valley, Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification of the collapse of the police.
This is when the Ministry of Interior intervenes."
Richard Lewis, chief of the police station, said, "I have been improving, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Bar is a "criminal" and impeachment is necessary to settle.
No one knows what's going on.
At present, we believe that we are involved in the cover-up cases and may take some time to investigate."
"We're going to do what we're going to do on the basis of the fact-related relationship and the time to discover facts."
This week's White House record revealed that Trump commissioned President Warodimir Zerensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.
According to the call record, Trump also asked Mr. Bar to cooperate with his personal advisor, Lucy Juliai.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine over a week of formal inquiry, and reported on Thursday.
The Ministry of Justice, who was accused of solicitation from information agencies, decided that Trump's telephone talks would not be involved in the investigation of political financing.
In response to the question that Mr. Bar should testify, Peloci stated on Friday that he would decide who to witness the Special Committee.
However, Mr. Pelosi added that Mr. Bar was "a criminal."
Indeed, the bar was pretty long.
"It was the name of the bar from the beginning," said Pelosi, who touched on Trump's name for the July telephone meeting with the President of Ukraine.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will approach the decision regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" about the internal accusations that became informational, Trump attacked the accused on Thursday as a spy.
The president's statement is too irresponsible and dangerous.
Peloci said that the internal accusations play an important role in the U.S. government's illegal exposure and publication, and that "the president said nothing wrong about the person who could provide information to the internal accusations," he said.
Mr. Peloši, on Tuesday, announced that he would formally impeachment the Trump clan to the foreign leaders for political benefit.
The call was included in the accusations released on Thursday, which claimed that Trump abused his job in the next 2020 presidential election to seek intervention in Ukraine.
They also claimed that the White House advisers ordered officials to remove calls from the cabinet-level computer system and replace them with special sensitive systems.

Ghana: Mr. Cofi Manuel and the Committee for Reviews
Cofi Manuel, a football advocate and executive of Secondi Hasscus, expressed concern about the composition of the next Ghana Football Association (GFA).
He questioned whether he would include Frank Davis, and expressed dissatisfaction with that.
In the interview with GNA Sport, Mr. Manuel stated that the chairman had an interest in the results of the judging process, and that it was fair or doubtful to include the president.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from an outside without prior interest.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, he argued that the commission of the judging committee should not be allowed.
On the other hand, Mr. Manuel suggests that if the Olympic Director Fred Papoe attends the committee, there is a conflict of interest on the chairman's side due to the relationship between the club and the chairman, Parmer would attend the committee.
The members of the committee were scheduled to start activities yesterday after their inauguration at the GFAAkra Secretariat on September 19.
The chairman is Frank Davis, a corporate governance consultant, and a member of the board member, Marian Barano and Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Reginald Lariair, Marketing and Sales Director Richard Akpocavi.
The survey of the Fukui Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that 54 percent and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture considered it "good at minimum wage thousand yen."
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies expected to be "saved" was around 50% of new graduates and regular employees.
Companies who answered "approved" to raise the yen at the time of payment (100 percent), construction (70,6%) and wholesale (61,7%).
The percentage of " opposition" was the majority of the manufacturing industry (51-9 percent), the service industry including food and dining, and accommodation (60 and 9 percent).
The staff at the conference said, "There is a tendency to oppose a high percentage of parts and time-consuming industries, but many companies think that it is difficult to secure human resources and increase labor costs."
The average amount of money was 895 yen (from October 4 to 829).
When I heard the hiring situation in March 19, the hiring of a new employee was 61,3 percent, the mid-term recruitment was 54,5 percent, and non-regular employment was conducted by 154%.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of plans was 44.7%, 50-3 percent, and non-regulars remained 31 percent.
In particular, the transportation industry (new graduates 13 and 3 percent, medium-sized 37,5 percent) and construction work (new graduate 24,1 percent, medium-sized 38-1 percent) struggled.
A total of 86 percent of the respondents had a problem in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the company's reputation was low.
Many of the measures required by the government in recruitment activities were to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the employment of the second graduate (departure within three years after graduation).
There was also a view to encouraging student approaches, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied, "I already accept it."
In addition to 20 and 3% of "I'm going to accept the future," one third of the overall posture was expressed.
The company "not admitted" was 644%, with a high level of construction (82, 8 percent), retail (73,1 percent), and manufacturing (72,7 percent).
The survey was conducted between July 19 and August 2 for 1,000 member companies.
298 companies (29.8%) responded.

the voice of the titricks before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiprick said, "We're going to show you now."
If Wales won the Wallads, it would become the most hot winner of the Pool D, possibly the semifinals against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia has played 15 matches against Wales, the Tiprick and the team are one straight line for England's best eight games.
"It's natural, I want to challenge both teams to win at the top of the group."
The match against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win in the autumn of last year.
I think Australia will blame me for returning the loan, but until I try to win it again.
I knew this game was a mountain before I came here.
and i'm here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales has won both Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in the past World Cup, and the victory to Wallads is the third place in 32 years.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the team's total score for the Southern Hemisphere weight class was only 7 wins in 41 rounds.
Wales stopped 13 November Test Match Australia's defeat last year, but Tiprick was included in a number of representative members who won the game 9-6 and was one of the players who played at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
Before the victory, Tiprick said: "It's hard to answer.
It was certainly a game, and maybe I thought that everyone would win, but I don't know well.
As a result, he scored about 15 points in the final game, so he seemed to have been far less competitive than actually."
In order to win Wales, a combination of Australia, which is worshiped as Back Lo, Michael Hoper and David Pocock, and a breakdown battle with Tipric are key.
Tiprick, who has previously played 67 international matches, has been fighting several matches in the past, and knows what is waiting.
"They are definitely the world level backs player," he says.
When you play against the world glass backrow, you always know that you're going to face a tough match.
They are always the world's highest level.
I'm sure what kind of game will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in defensive battles, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in the sense of having to go properly to the desired place.
I want to increase myself by fighting with the best players in the world.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against the two, you have to keep yourself up.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important match for us.
The momentum is important.
If you continue to make a good performance, then you can do a game that will not lose on the momentum.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo has '90 percent of gala', would it be a gift from performers?
A series of problems with Yoshimoto Kogyo, which triggered the dark business of antisocial forces, have also been closed.
Akihiko Okamoto, president of the press conference on July 22, said, "The company does not have any talent in 9 or so," on average, "5:5 to 6:4," but the geisha resisted.
If the ratio of "9:1" is 90 percent, the view of investors who are considered to have been gifted to Yoshimoto from entertainers and tax-intensive is also flowed on Twitter, and more than 30,000 repeats have been made.
If Galla's withdrawal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was asked by Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not eligible for a gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the tax position.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual but a corporation, it is not subject to a gift tax first.
If the amount of work for 100 million yen was "9:1," Yoshimoto's sales amounted to ¥100 million and the cost of 10 million yen.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax declarations and already pay corporate taxes.
Also, even if you're wondering about allocation, you don't argue that the amount you actually receive is different from the original amount.
And I think the amount you received will be declared as sales.
If the player does not recognize it, it will not be a gift if the opponent was an individual.
It is a matter of calculating taxes if prices are clearly priced (e.g., real estate sales, etc.) traded at prices that are far away from the original price for tax avoidance.
However, as this time, the third party will not decide how much tax appropriate prices are for those who have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think the payment book for 1 yen is a poison.

the white house, the impeachment of the impeachment, the big panic.
White House officials were eager to counter the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party on Thursday, and detailed officials explained that there was no plan to deal with the emerging reality for a week.
People close to the White House said that the appeal of internal accusations on the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have been increasing in concern, anxiety, and concern about the possibility that the President and some peripherals inflict a significant damage.
He said, "I don't know what it is."
The White House officials joked that there was no obvious plan on this situation, or the possibility that the president could not apply the usual measures that had been successfully involved in the matter until now was so serious that he had no confidence in how to proceed.
Another person who is familiar with this controversy expressed the atmosphere of the White House, which is increasing the alert mind, as the president's response to this impeachment was delayed and the possibility of being "necessarily negative."
Another concern is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised daily, and there is also a close associate of the president who is considering acting "impulsive."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable actions and concerns about the possibility of violent attacks on unexpected means, and is concerned about President and politics in the environment of election year.
Trump has faced the greatest threat that has never been in office, and has changed his hands to the attackers and defenses, such as reviving the strategy that Robert Morler himself considered effective during the Russian investigation.
Trump tried to take a look at the request of the Ukrainian President, who wanted to cooperate with the investigation of the political opponents, and was interested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the internal accused as a motive for the conflict.
However, many White House officials have endured the trial of Morler, but this time they began to feel the difference.
Although he was a brand president, he seemed to have visited the press conference on Wednesday, and he said he was familiar with the situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but it seems he was not in the heart of answering questions about Ukraine.
Some of the internal accusations have identified the fact that President Trump, Vladimir Zerensky, and the fact that he had not had direct information on the call with the Ukrainian president, have also been convinced that damage can be mitigated.
Furthermore, it is often happens when the president is attacked, but the momentum of the support layer increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic house near the White House pointed out that the basic support rate of the president was already very high and the effect of getting new supporters by impeachment would not be much.
In particular, if the impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at 4-6 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information has stated that those who argue that impeachment could help the president have not fully grasped how much uncertainty the response of the president is.
The White House officials concerned are seeking advice on advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the plan's bones, this initiative is still in the early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of actions such as the strategic decision room will be implemented.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have clear leaders who can organize public relations activities in an aggressive manner to counter the momentum of publication of organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, and the release of critical internal accusations to the Democratic impeachment.
According to this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspective is clearly visible, such as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Finance Stephen Mushins, who expressed that it would not be possible to publish notes on the call with the President of Ukraine for 48 hours.
According to Robert Morler's investigation, who is involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitble of Trump, who was the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwanduski told NBC news that it is not accurate to suggest that he would become a leader in such efforts.
"We have done everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we have never talked with the president and close associates about participating in the team to counter this false impeachment."
Trump's external lawyer Jay Scorp is also involved in impeachment efforts.
In response to NBC news coverage, Scorp said, "The problem is properly handled."
At the end of Moeller's investigation, Emmet Frad left the White House, and Pat Cipolon, the current White House legal advisor, had little experience, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience of impeachment.
More information about the White House strategy is generally recognized that officials are far from recruiting human resources and building strategic teams, but they need human resources who can lead all of their efforts and political struggle.

To distance love must be prepared Only 16% success rate Tomoyoshi Morikawa - Yahoo! News
9/6 (Fri) 13:51
I was able to make my boyfriend a long distance love for his work ...
I was told to marry someday, but I couldn't see the goal.
What should we do when we get married?
I heard a solution to Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa, who lectured "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice from detailed data analysis is essential.
this is my concern.
I'm worried about continuing my relationship with my boyfriend in distant love.
I continued to live in Kansai, where my workplace and my family were.
As a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that we will marry in the future, but we cannot see the goal at all.
what should we do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office).
A couple who came to marry from distant love
C is in love with a boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also a word that "the distance is tested and the two will be strong," but in the first place, does it work?
Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter Morikawa) The survey conducted by DeNA Travel (as of August 2017) is famous, but according to the data, only 16% of couples have been married from distant love to marriage.
Since love is done with five senses, it is originally a relationship with looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touching), smelling the smell (no smell), kissing.
However, in the case of distant love, there is a large half case to hear the voice on the phone.
It may be difficult to continue with hearing only in situations.
There is also a cost problem.
If you're going to an opponent's house, you'll have time and effort to go to the transportation cost and you're on holiday to heal your work fatigue.
When I go home, I feel comfortable.
Is it the only way to break away?
Morikawa If you are a couple who can endure without frequent meetings or a couple who are determined in advance, I think it will work.
If you're engaged in one year or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you don't see a future landing point.

devin nenes, condemning the Democratic Party for Trump's nude photography.
Devin Nunes, a California Republican, seems to be unable to bear the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, he was accused of the Democratic Party trying to get the President's nude photo.
Members of the House of Representatives Special Committee of the House of Representatives, Nunes, filed a statement at the beginning of the trial of Trump's request to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The Congress condemned the Democratic Party to see the President's naked photo, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the left and media assets.
"The Democratic Party of the Special Committee negotiated with Ukrainians for the purpose of acquiring Trump's nude photographs."
It is natural that everyone asks why the Democratic Party is so excited to impeach the president, or that opportunity within a year.
After Nnes's scolding, Huff Post's journalist Jennifer Bendilly decided to determine whether the Democratic Party would seek the truth.
He was the only member of the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, but also many other members questioned whether the answer was a naked truth.
Mediret Dotcom speculates that Nunes's nude comments may be related to the "more unidentified details" that were written in steel documents that were discussed.
It was reported by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected a shocking claim against Trump, in one of the rooms in Moscow, where Trump is viewing the urination of prostitutes, referring to the "Okko Tape."

in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles and Tesla trucks and semis have monopolized the news, it is the only flight to fly in the sky, and it is said that renewable energy is not available.
However, the University of Alberta developed technology to use renewable biofuels as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor of the Alberta Agricultural and Life Sciences Department, started the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel from lipid waste such as fat fat, livestock rendering, and canola oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology uses low-quality fats for production, with less than 85% carbon release than crude fuel, making it possible to utilize waste from other industries in the production process.
This technique also acts as a reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "This technology was achieved by the first generation, which is a hydrocarbon of the molecule itself in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofueling techniques tend to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems in aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like dilemmas," said Bresler.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as a jet biofuel.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires another treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler described the second option: "You can try the reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is risky.
As airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army have increased their investment in renewable options, Fortune Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They predict that someday someone will impose carbon taxes."
I would like to prepare for the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, which recently invested $500 million from Lockheed Martin to $400 million in support of building a production facility in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 1900 million litter biofuels annually.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate of fuel transportation and production is not higher.
"As a technical store," says Bresler.
My job is to create an option so that you can make multiple choices in parallel with your decision.

Boris Johnson warns that if Brexit is over, Britain faces riots like Los Angeles, and Prime Minister calls for calmness.
If the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a risk that "a violent riot by the people" would occur in the country last night.
The Prime Minister's officials warned that Britain would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the riot of citizens in the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
Johnson stated that it was necessary to "teach anger" against political words that had been exchanged with intense speech, but he argued that the term "default" would not be used.
While Prime Minister appealed to the Times to regain calmness, some ministers said: "In this country, there was no such thing as the Gyre Joene or the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country just because they have never happened.
There's already a yellow best movement - they're encrypting their phones and organizing demonstrations, and then there's a few populist leaders who use dirty hands.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when four white policemen who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King passed the jury's innocence.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstrations, wearing the yellow vest, have caused confusion and destruction in the city of Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed to Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives, stating that if Britain failed to leave the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, 100 million people are dissatisfied."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, they would not give up by writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time for tens of thousands of people to repeat.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum would cover the first outcome, there would be a risk of a "strong riot" in this country.
Johnson, in the general election, sought to leave Breguet's decision to voters.
Johnson is reported to have faced a rebellion in the House of Representatives seeking to lower the demands for EU withdrawal and instead hit the EU with compromises.

Pakistani social media celebrity brother of honor murder
Women's rights experts say that the procedure may take longer than the execution of the sentence, while the accused murderers are bailed and the memory of the incident is diluted.
The women's rights activist Farzana Bali, founder of the first gender school in Pakistan, added that it took more than three years to solve even the Baroti incident, which has attracted attention.
Although it is difficult to prove reliable data, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "religious murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the number of real honor homicides is much more than that, but it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorary homicides that occur every year in the world are occupied by Pakistan.
Pork cholera measures 1.3 billion yen to add to the September correction plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo! News

india, flooding by longing monsoons in many areas, and big confusion.
The monsoon season in India is about a month long, an unprecedented rainfall caused by buildings collapsed and many crops have begun to rot.
The monsoon in northern India usually weakens its power in early September, but the average rainfall in this month has increased by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, Monsoon will weaken during the most slow period of the past few decades.
Many areas in India still have unprecedented rains, and on the latest news, the buildings collapsed due to heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday.
The house was flooded, and the residents crossed the street with water to knee, and it is usually seen at the peak of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Laguna, and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rain.
In the northern part of Uttarakand, it suffered heavy damage to houses due to heavy rain.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
In many regions, lack of water, farmers were preparing for drought.
For farmers, longing monsoons are not desirable.
At this time the rain is not normal.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Bimtal, Utterabad, said, "We are making cabbage, beans, peas, tomatoes, but vegetables are rotting in rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine is rising at a slower pace.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, the onion of 20 rupees (23 pens) per kilogram is usually sold at 80 rupees (about 1 pound).
The festival is also in danger.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides that can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack.
When working around pesticides in high concentrations, the latest research shows that the risk of heart disease may be higher.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese American kloops in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to a group of men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"It is important to note that when exposed to pesticides in the work, it is important to wear personal protective equipment, describe the presence of pesticide exposure in the work, and to reduce the standard risk factor of heart disease," said Beatrice Rodrigues, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a senior medical professor at the University of Hawaii.
This was the result of the study of data collected from more than 6,000 men in Oahu, who participated in the Kakini Honolulu Heart Program.
This study is aimed at only Japanese American men, so researchers may not apply to women or other races.
Because pesticides have a long period of half-life, health impacts may appear after years of exposure.
This study showed the greatest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important."
This is probably because the importance of other factors related to aging is increasing, and it hides the possible relationship between pesticides and mental diseases in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Zellensky: Poloshenco intervention at Trump's telephone meeting.
The impeachment of Donald Trump's U.S. president was made, and the Washington political issue was a dramatic week.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners, Vladimir Zerensky.
However, what has been known about the Zellensky Trump phone problem?
At the beginning of the telephone meeting, Trump told Zelensky that the United States had various conveniences in Ukraine from other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not sequential, it has been described in detail that Trump has criticized the fact that Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders are dedicated to speaking more specific proposals.
The response of Zelensky, who opposed Trump 100% rather than 1000 percent, is disputed.
Zelensky added that both Macron and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties discussed social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poloshenko wrote on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance received from the EU."
In addition, Polo Shenco tweeted that he was grateful for the support of the EU sanctions and economic assistance in the invasion of Russia.
Some Ukrainian politicians, Victoria Voticica, expressed concern as "Is it possible to negotiate again with Germany and France."
Following Trump's request for military assistance and two surveys, not one, to Zelensky, the first is to suggest that Joe Baiden's son Hunter, and the second is the investigation of the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic e-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would interfere with European relations, or whether the French and German leaders would lay their backwaters.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
As a result of the announcement of the call, Zerensky said in the New York General Assembly.
Zelensky will meet Russian, German and French leaders at the Nordic 4 Summit scheduled in October.

On April 3, 2019, Mr. Peter Gayno, Secretary of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, gave a smile on the testimony of the 2020 FEMA budget bill case at the National Security Council at Capitol Hill, Washington.
Washington (Royter Communications) - According to the White House announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed him Thursday and Peter Gaino as the Chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Mr. Gayno, Deputy Director of FEMA, was the deputy director of the government's disaster response, including hurricanes and fire.
Since March, the former Secretary of State Block Long resigned, the Senate's authorized secretary was absent.
The Ministry of Homeland Security, which is the upper body of FEMA, refused to use the government's public car for commuting between Washington and his home, and resigned.
Dr. Jeffrey Baierd, who had already been nominated for one, brought up suspicions of being drunk and involved in the riots, and was removed from the selection at the beginning of this month after consideration.
His appointment was as expected.
In the future, the majority of Senate approvals are required.
Prior to serving as Deputy Secretary of FEMA in 2018, Gayno had served at the Emergency Management Bureau in Rhode Island, and stated that the White House was a naval soldier.
CBS Los Angeles - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying business in San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (BSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity of Thursday and San Gabriel Valley.
The police began to care at 4:37 p.m. on suspicion of illegal marijuana pen sales, and a large container was found at office buildings in the 9600 block of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators had found equipment packed with bayp cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
Captain Cano had previously been engaged in drug investigation and stated that it could be fired in the process of extracting oil used for Bayp products.
"The static electricity from the clothes may fire, and because it is concentrated, it causes not only fires but also explosions," he said.
In addition, if there were multiple containers, it could not only explode one after another, but also burn the entire building.
The danger group was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
He received an anonymous information and told the investigators that it led to an investigation warrant on the site that found illegal activities.
The investigator still pursues who is the black curtain of illegal Bayp activities.
The police said that the office was empty and that Zhang himself had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that they would like to take a recent news on the risk of batping, and that they would prefer to avoid getting out of the illegal packing product.
Captain Cano said, "It's really a real thing or a substitute to buy without knowing."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a significant impact on our community and children, so police are constantly warning people to avoid these activities.

Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I.
It was woven with silver foil yarns made of the finest camlet silk, and the gorgeous embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was fluffy.
Herstic Royal Palace dress collection curator, Eli Lin, refused to be one.
Lin's eyes are said to have been placed on the wall of a small church in the countryside 100 years ago, and it seems to be part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this gorgeous cloth used as the altarpiece of the church in Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited near that room that could be worn by Queen Tudor over 450 years.
Other than the rest of the 16th century dress, it is found that the entire royal dress collection was an important discovery.
Although Elizabeth had no perfect evidence of the dress through sleeves, he was convinced that the dress had not been a part of the royal possession for three years.
However, it is suggested that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears that the previous owner was a noble person.
At the time the dress was made, it seems that it was a price equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rival wearing such luxurious clothing would not have endured.
Mr. Lin said it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues.
I was always happy to hear that the cloth was "great" and I was sure to see one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of one of the dresses used as altarpieces of the Holy Face Church of Bactton, cut off, seems unlikely.
Bactton is a village from Brunswick Parley, who served as a female officer throughout the long life of Queen Elizabeth, and is said to have been associated with Paley for a long time.
The dress is after Paley's death in 1590, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, it must have been brought to the family or church.
More than 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altarpiece cloth is expected to be displayed next to Elizabeth's portrait, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition period.
The vast space as much as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries was only a modified greenhouse on the Hampton Court site, and the conservation work was done almost here.
Looking at the embroidered embroidery on the front and back, I feel very much respect for those who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held from October 12 at Hampton Court Palace.

Isuzu's large truck Giga, the latest model to be released in the world...Tokyo Motor Show 2019 - Yahoo! News
Isuzu Motor Show 2019 will be held from October 24 to November 4 at Tokyo Big Sight.
In addition to the latest advanced safety equipment, Isuzu Truck's flagship model, Giga has expanded its fatigue reduction gear to the driver.
It contributes to safe driving, including pre-cav brakes that detect pedestrians and bicycles, blind spot monitors that support the suppression of winding accidents at the right left and lane changes, and variable optical LED head lamps.
It also contributes to reducing the fatigue of the driver by cruises between the all-wheel speed millimeter-wave vehicles that follow the front car at full speed.
In addition, the vehicle operation and dynamics management system also expanded vehicle conditions.
The operation status of safety equipment is also monitored and supports safe operation.
The world premiere of the "FL-IR" that represents future logistics networks as a showcase.
FL-IR is similar to the interaction and behavior of ultrasound seen in fishes, as well as the connection and line running.
Exterior adopts a bio-design that gives the image of an efficient robot with the motif of a shark, and features the contrast between the organic shape that breaks the wind and the rigid aero device covering it.
The interior adopts a layer design that switches dashboards with manual and automatic driving mode changes.
The seat is placed in the center and combines comfortable operation and habitability.
It is also the first release of the world, but the next generation of small delivery cars "ElfEV Walkthrough Ban."
Not only zero emissions and low noise, but also the walkthrough structure that was realized by EVs, we also consider the efficiency of the driver's working environment and distribution work.
The driver has a rotating seat to support the driver's move.
In terms of safety, it is equipped with a wide range of electronic mirror systems and a 3D surround multiview that can be seen around the vehicle.
In addition, we will exhibit the first hybrid bus "Elga Duo" in Japan jointly developed by Hino and the small track "Elf," which has made significant improvements, and diesel 4JZ1 engine that achieves both the latest emissions regulations and fuel consumption.
"PREISM" and "PREISM" are introduced in video and panel exhibitions.
The family space offers a touch panel that allows you to see how many tracks are used, and a photo booth where you can become a truck driver.
A drone arrived at the space base and caught with a robot arm | Shizuoka Shimbun
No. 8 unmanned supply aircraft arrived at the International Space Station.
From the bottom left, the robot arm of the station is growing.
JAXA staff members who successfully catch the International Space Station Unit No. 8 (JAXA) = 28 (JAXA)
On the night of the 28th, Astronauts arrived near the station and captured the robot arm.
The aircraft was launched 25 days from Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, and gradually advanced in control of JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
Finally, by flying at the same speed as the station, the speed difference is no longer possible.
The robot arm of the length of 17 and 6 meters is a flow that grabs the supplies.
It has about 5 or 3 tons of supplies.
After installing the station, the flight attendants carry the luggage.
i've been involved in a third of the u.s. drugs
Immediately after the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in white daylight.
Nearly 800 people died in Chicago last year.
McNight said that 90% of drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA, commonly known as El Mencho, focuses on Mexican narcotics.
"Mencho is one of the top priorities of the federal law enforcement agencies in Mexico," said Matthew DonahDEA.
El Mencho's winnings reach $1,000.
With the help of Donahhe, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were violent.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisko Nueva, is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the cartel has sold a large amount of cocaine, methane phenyl mixed heroin.
El Mencho's head won $1,000.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California for 30 years, but was arrested for drug trafficking and returned to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel.
He owns a large amount of weapons, carrying rockets and 50 calibers.
In fact, he also owned his own special mobility team, and he said.
From the death of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders have occurred due to drug trafficking.
According to statistics from the Mexican government, about 94 murders occurred on a day.
In Chicago, the confiscated Mexican drug is toxic, so it is necessary to wear protective clothing when handling.
At the manufacturing center, the seal of the solder is pressed in the bag of cocaine.
More than one third seems to have been made by El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahhe said, "Mencho is involved in the influx of harmful substances that effectively capture the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone died, Donahe said that it was "probably" drugs brought from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died last year.

Children who write at the farewell party of Corela "Arth" - 28th, Tennoji Zoo in Osaka City
Teno-ji Zoo (Tenno-ji Ward, Osaka City) opened a farewell party in Osaka Prefecture.
In mid-October, a 10-year loan to the British zoo was decided, and it is likely that he would not return.
thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of the house where eucalyptus grew.
He was 12 years old.
The life expectancy of Corea was between 15 and 20 years, and it is likely that he would be full of Tenju in the UK, where he was married.
Mr. Eiki Tsujimoto (40) is responsible for tears, saying, "It is not cut down the curtain on the breeding of Corea.
Sony, PlayStation 4 surprise news, PS4 game was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the contents of the Last of Part 2.
As part of the recent state-of-play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020.
Some of these new action games were presented to fans.
A few days later, the news of the Last of As2 was published.
Sony and Noty Dog seem to return to the wind in many ways.
Since the time of PSwan, the Last of As Part 2 has been released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Notydog Neil Drackman announced that the sequel evolved into one of the largest games ever.
"In a different sense than the previous version, the story is magnificent and complex."
Thus, it was necessary to talk about stories with many characters.
It was not intended to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolds, but the user felt that this was the end, but in fact, it started and realized that all other sections would start."
The game did not enter a single blue ray, but it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 includes one or two bad Easter Eggs (via Gamespot) when opening at work.
Although this surprise doesn't exist, Easter Eggs in the game contain the works of nostalgic notic dogs.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 limited to PS4, you will see more.
Those who have PS4 should pick up the last of as well as prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced the free PS4 game of Play Station Plus, including the aforementioned Noty Dogs.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including popular character Erie backpacks and bracelet replicas and bonus versions with 12 inch figures.
The Notoshima Transportation Sales Committee tried to encourage residents to continue (Khokukoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th day of Noto Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased, the movement sales started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council.
During the trial until December, wagons with daily supplies, seasonings, and food ran over Susomachikai and Hanurachokai.
Some of the products that were sold more than expected and were quickly replenished, and the residents asked them to continue saying "I am happy to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, garbage bags and detergents.
The total vegetables, such as potato salads that were divided into packs, were arranged at a price of 100 yen.
At the Suso-chokai, people's columns were made, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akira Kikuchi of the Council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) in Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping at his husband's driving, said, "I don't know when my father can drive, and I want to continue."
The user also ordered a "canned coffee," not a canned coffee, but a cup of coffee that lipsticks themselves."
The council will consider what was requested.
At Noto Island, there are only one convenience store where you can buy daily goods, and the council tried to save "shop weak."
By December, we will consider whether the 20-machi-kai in the island will be held once a month, and whether it will continue as a business after the next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed the decision to add $100 million to the affected population.
The cash support policy for farmers affected by droughts has been extended, and the existing farm benefits are greatly reviewed for simplicity.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought relief agency and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of $3,000.
As a grant program for drought-related areas, each of the 13 municipalities will provide up to $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought damage.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion as a drought support.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014 for killing four of Stephen and Katie Stay and five children.
On July 9, 2014, Haskel broke into his house and asked his wife Melanie Haskel's whereabouts.
Melanie was absent, but his sister, Katie Stay and his family were there.
Haskel fired, and the Harris County Police Department reported that Stephen Stay (39), Katie State (33), 13-year-old son, nine-year-old and seven-year-old daughter.
In his family, only one person, who was 15 years old at that time, was left alone.
At the time, the authorities reported that he was seriously wounded, but then recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed all charges against Ronald Lee Haskel's heart loss.
The jury was dismissed from the order of the month.
"If we choose to be disappointed, we will never forgive."
I wonder if the girl's appeal to anger was echoed by the leaders of each country.
Global warming is getting worse.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, a 16-year-old environmental activist Gregta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
He made a boycott of the class and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
The young people who raised anxiety and affluence protested all over the world, including Japan.
It seems that about 4 million people participated in more than 150 countries.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, which started in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the latter half of the century and to reduce the temperature rise to less than twice before the industrial revolution.
All participating countries, regardless of the distinction between developed countries and developing countries, take measures.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to the relationship with global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, follows various regions.
In order to increase global warming at a fast pace, efforts are expected to be strengthened.
At the summit held by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goals to virtually zero by 50.
Other 70 countries raised their target for the immediate future.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which expressed the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not express their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers became apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
According to the government's long-term strategy, as early as the latter half of the century, the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at the environmental-related meeting, said that he should work on fun, cool and sexy issues at the meeting.
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
I don't have any opposition to Mr. Greta, a symbol of the environmental movement.
The injury that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "Replacement of Issues" that the person opposes.
There is no longer a limit to global warming, and the international community must respond to a common crisis.
Each country has its own initiative, and it cannot be fully effective.
There are many young people and children behind him.
It is an adult who should act to avoid taking the future.
it's also a step to realize quantum internet
The research results of the United States Army led to the realization of quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to secure military security, measure and measure time functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the U.S. Army Research Institute's Distributed Quantum Information Center, which is funded by the U.S. Army Research Institute, Insbruck University researchers achieved record of quantum entangling transport between materials and light - 50 km away using optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangling state and one is measured, even if the other quantum bits are physically distant, the measurement results are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is more than two digits, and it is realistic to start building a intercity quantum network."
It is said that the intercity quantum network consists of a network of physical quantum bits in Entangle, despite the large distance.
Researchers say that this diversification is essential for the establishment of quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale decentralized engagement," says Dr. Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains enough quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on ions, and at the same time excited them to release photons stored in quantum information.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangular.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of the photon emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and it will soon be absorbed into the optical fiber cable."
The Doctor's team first sent light particles through non-linear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nm, which is the standard wavelength for long-distance transfers.
Then the photon was sent through a fiber optic cable of 50 kilometers long.
In the measurement results, atoms and light particles remained entangangled despite the long-range migration of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms can capture calcium at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangling network in long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle watch network is a very important field for the Army, from precise location measurements, navigation methods, and time-consuming applications."
