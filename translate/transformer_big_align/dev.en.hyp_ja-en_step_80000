Croatian nuclear treatment facility planning, Bosnians protest
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and protested the neighboring Croatian plan to store some of the waste from its only nuclear power plant near the river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The protesters gathered in the city of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly demanded Croatia to abandon the plan to store the site of the barracks of the Turkovska Gola and fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant.
The Bosnian people, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," "The river needs us."
We must oppose it.
The mayor of Novi Grado, Miloslav Dryaka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the rivers.
The Kursko nuclear power plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will hold consultations next week to discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
Croatian national broadcasters reported on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided to build its own storage facility or to pay for the cost of the waste of Croatia, which was processed by Slovenian new facilities.
The Croatian Ministry of Environmental Protection, Minister of Environment and Energy, Tomilab Chorich, said that Croatia has a problem in the disposal of public facilities from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wants to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents in the country claimed that Croatia would find another location on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket be the best place in Croatia?"

I'll explain to you, or complain about false symptoms.
The test results are made to make sure that the child is sick, such as mixing glucose with diabetic samples.
Excessively administered drugs and other drugs to cause disease symptoms.
How general is the Münchhausen syndrome?
Since many cases have not been reported, it is difficult to know how widespread this syndrome is.
According to a study published in 2000, it was estimated that over two years, there were 89 cases of 100,000 people.

Kaduna - Kaduna Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children.
Police said that the children were placed in an inhuman environment, but the school denied this claim.
"The children are in school with parents' consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering a child, parents signed their consent.
The parents came to deliver meals to their children every day, so they knew what kind of environment they were doing.
It was very surprised that the police came and evacuated the children, and after all the food delivered by their parents left, the school closed.
This is an unfair treatment for parents who can testify whether the police had children in such a terrible environment."
He added that the former police headquarters, Abdullahman, had visited once to confirm what kind of environment the children were, but there was no complaint.
They also learned Corran and said that it was all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Savo said that children would be reunited after they were handed over to the state government.
"They were placed in an inhuman environment, nominally to obtain knowledge about Corran.
Many children were injured on their back.
That's why we are investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Central Coast's "super evil undo" girl raped by camouflaged clothes, an order to confront the victim in court.
In May 2017, a man wearing a camouflage gilly suit with leaves caught a 12-year-old girl behind him at school in Central Coast, California.
After that, the man was forced to commit suicide by making the girl vulnerable to trees.
Immediately after the arrest, the house search warrant was executed, and police officers seized many items related to the investigation.
From August 2016 to April 2017, the man was convicted of seven suspicions, including three charges, including this assault and another 11-year-old girl Grimming and sexual abuse.
When the 12-year-old victim pretended to be walking on the road, a man armed with a large wooden branch and a knife suddenly witnessed coming out of the bushes.
When the girl asked him, "Don't stop, stop it."
The man said to the girl, "I will give you a loud voice.
If you hear a loud voice, you will not be able to respond to the pain."
The man had a knife on his right hand and his hands of a girl tied in a cable tie, then hit the tree and abused for nearly an hour.
A man ran into a school with a cable and a girl screamed like crazy.
The man had several phone mails and telephones from his workplace colleagues, but he did not respond and arrived at work around 9:30 AM.
The man stood out in the clothes of mud, grass, trees, etc., and claimed that he was involved in street violence, and that he was chasing the driver to the bushes, when he was in the hands of clay.
The man's trial continues on Tuesday.
Pope, AI development, based on public interests, warns IT companies.
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, investors, etc. that artificial intelligence development competition and other digital development would increase social injustice if there was no moral assessment of public interests.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met.
At the meeting, a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions on future and dangers in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions were held on the future of wartime technology development and increased machine work, and at the same time, examples of the gunfire incident in Christchurch, New Zealand and the social media companies responding to the atrocities were also verified.
In his speech at the meeting, Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines were released from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely on robot engineering to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances cause increasingly noticeable inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, unfortunately, they will be able to reverse the state of a kind of barbarian based on the theory of strong people.
According to the organizers of the conference, I would like to take advantage of the expertise of the participants and find people who can be a future advisor to the Catholic Church in high-tech areas.

Martin Woodegoll showed a surprise support for Michel Oyalusabal.
Real Madrid won the Osssona at 2-0, renewing the undefeated record in the current domestic season, leading to La Liga.

With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third penalty spot in the stunning Oyalusabar, Alabeth's Midfiller, Manuel Garcia, secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before the end of 5 minutes.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
The young Norwegians, who were 20 years old, are now showing their territory.
She was surprised by the name of Sharad Powerle in Anna Hazale, Maharashtra's bank fraud case.

Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Power, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted detailed investigation into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, veteran of numerous corruption prevention activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerle denied any fraud and claimed that there was no relationship with the co-bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just a few weeks before the Maharashtra parliamentary election on October 21.
The former Minister of the Union clearly pointed to the government led by the People's Party of India, stating that he would not surrender before Delhi's "Lord."

Stop the accident!
Four preemptive devices that can be reared - Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by driving mistakes.
In particular, an accident caused by brake and accelerator mistake by older drivers is on an increasing trend.
In particular, when it comes to a sudden, it becomes panic, and when you are going to step on the brake pedal, the accelerator will remain on it.
A new car equipped with a safety driver support function that does not cover such driving errors, but there is also a rearing device that can be mounted on an unattended car.
Such after-sale parts manufacturers are developing and selling emergency prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what characteristics each has.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and at the same time.
[e-ACEL ALRM] To inform you of the mistake of pedals from a new perspective, "e-ACEL ALRM" developed by Pibot.
The pedal step mistake is to be avoided by " alarm sound."
The mechanism causes " alarm sound" when you need to take the accelerator pedal by mistake when you stop or slow driving.
By reacting to the sound and prompting the accelerator to return, it avoids rapid acceleration by quickly recognizing the step mistake.
It is also effective for elderly drivers who are difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the step mistake of the accelerator.
It is attached to the OBDII connector and the body is attached on both sides.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is also attractive that the setting is necessary.
The world wing was launched in mid-September, but the accelerator brake step-by-step fault prevention device "Do you watch it as well."
It is also possible to withdraw (back) without advance.
At the time of the stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is suddenly stepped down, the vehicle's vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, electrically suppresses the accelerator opening and suppresses the rapid advance.
When I accidentally stepped on the accelerator pedal, I didn't tell the signal from the accelerator, and immediately controlled the advance by turning it into a creep running state (where I left the brake in the D range).
In the back (back), there is also a function to detect the speed of about 5Km/h or more and force the vehicle to switch to the creep state.
The mounting is only possible with caparion and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

"Because adults were busy cleaning up their homes and had no time to face enough," he said.
Yukari Ogushi (36) in Shiraishi-cho spent a night in the evacuation town hall with four families, including three-year-old children.
"If there was a child who was not able to stay there, I would use the feeling around him."
The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children from 4 to 12 years old, was soaked in water around the house.
"I can't run away with five people," he said, "I'm going to spend as much time at home as possible in the disaster, and I have food and simple toilets.
"There is no right answer to the preparation, and the need for family configuration and housing changes."
Shinko Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, with a 6-year-old and 8-year-old child, proposed that " elementary school had an e-mail from the school on the day before, but the nursery school didn't have a communication network or a mail system."
There were also requests to build systems that could be shared in real time on flooded roads.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed before, and "It was okay last time."I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
Mr. Tanaka said, "The opinions that were issued are thought to be communicated to the government as a group."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businessman Jennifer Currii to the police agency.
The Police Agency (IOPC) will examine whether the scandal in London mayor's office is a violation of the Penal Code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the "Acts" of the Prime Minister on suspicion that Mr. Curri had received preferential treatment from the friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"There is information that indicates that there is a possibility of a crime," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this matter.
The problem was entrusted to IOPC, but the IOPC was an agency corresponding to charges issued by the police in England and Wales.
This problem was entrusted to the police agency because Johnson was at the time in a position comparable to the police officer.
Johnson denied fraud related to the relationship between the two parties.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's orders to provide detailed information about his relationship with the Archici.
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported that the Americans who moved to London seven years ago were paid 126,000 pounds from public money during the London mayor's period, and that Johnson and others were given preferential measures to join the foreign trade delegation three times.
Since then, the government has frozen the grant of 100,000 pounds to the hacker house, a company of Mr. Curi in the survey.
The company will ask questions about the investigation process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Waman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Department of Digital has "normal proper evaluation" and that the company owns a British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Curri (34) is now located.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among the staff."
The movement of the GLA to entrust the Prime Minister to the police agency touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
The government officials said that this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the previous night of the Conservative Party was "too party-oriented."
"There was no evidence for any charges, and the Prime Minister had no opportunity to answer the director before the news reports that were issued late on Friday."
The people and the media will also see the political Kyogen that was organized by AMA.
As I mentioned earlier, the Standard newspaper heard that the relationship between Johnson and California businessman supported by the London Tourism Promotion Division was "public secret."
The former staff of the London and Partners (L&P) said that despite the fact that the company was "untrustless" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany foreign trade-related talks led by the Mayor Johnson.
A safe fund for ordinary living people to use to form assets!
The 20th Anniversary of the Sunrise Fund - Yahoo! News
I heard the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawakami (photo), President and CEO of Yukinobu Sawakami.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
What are you feeling now?
First, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all those involved, not just the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the "Sawakami Fund" was established with the desire to support the formation of property for general residents.
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursuing for 20 years.
We are encouraged to work day-to-day as a whole, with the belief that the world will be brighter from the foundation when the general public is eliminated from the anxiety of money.
In the long term, operations are not graded unless they are together with beneficiaries.
There are a lot of money in the "Sawakami Fund" when the market plunges like the Lehman shock and the collapse of the IT bubble.
"We will support companies that are needed in the world because of this situation," I feel that we have understood the message that we have stated since the day.
We believe that this is the reason why it became a long-term fund for 20 years, and that it continued to be a direct sales system to deliver messages directly to many people.
At the end of each month, we have disclosed all investment companies, amounts and costs.
In general, just telling the results, the information about what you buy now is black box.
This is why we can trust you.
the third drug arrester is the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - Last year, the third man was arrested for drug crimes associated with the death of rapper Mac Miller in excess of drugs.
According to the trial records, Steven Walter was charged with selling a fake pill of oxycodon, which was contained by Fentanyl in September last year before Miller accidentally took over cocaine, alcohol and Fentanyl, but Fentanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has been a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Pett, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a trial record published on Tuesday, Pettyt had obtained drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Libis, who was arrested early this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, was accused of delivering drugs to Petty as Walter's "deliver."
All three were not directly charged with Miller's death, and there were still anti-bents about individual cases.
Walter, currently in custody, was sentenced to five months in prison due to a drug arrest in 2005.
On Thursday, the prosecutors in charge of the case, which was first reported by the celebrity site TMZ, requested that Walter be detained until the trial began due to the high possibility of escape from abroad.
There was no immediate reply to a lawyer's call message.
Petitt was prosecuted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defenders refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics include a frank word about depression and drug use, and in the hip hop world, he gained fans as one of the Great Palaces.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, but was defeated in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his beloved mirror in his Instagram and published a song about the mirror, "Sancu Neckst."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died in recent years related to opioid drug abuse.
The rock band Three Doors Down guitarist Matthew Roberts died due to excessive intake of drugs in 2016.
This article corrected Walter's name by Stephen instead of Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
This 9-year-old boy uses a free programming app called Scratch2 to create a rubbish game.
By using scratch 2, games, animations and stories can be produced on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's games are programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats from the hiding place.
He learned how to make games in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN that he spent time making games when bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day short-term intensive course for children aged 5 to 15.
This course, sponsored by Code Fest International, was introduced to give children a chance to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in many mobile games.
"When I was four years old, I bought a tablet.
Candace crashes and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, when he was seven years old, he became interested in the game production.
"One day I was playing a tablet as usual, but I was too obsessed with the game, so I got a bit angry," he said.
He said, "I'm always playing games, but how do you make games yourself so that others can play?"
When I said that, I was angry and I didn't expect Basil to care about it."
Since then, Basilchan, who has been interested in learning how to make his game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step of the game production.
Basil-chan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has a name in his game.
One of the games, "Moskyt mash" can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is the case, young people such as Basil have the power to lead.
Recently, two of Nigeria's twelve-year-old children were awarded a robot that uses the program code to divide housework.
In May 2019, a women's high school team in Ghana who programming boxed robots won the Robofest contest.
Google and Microsoft's huge technology companies have increased African investment, and Basil-chan and the children of the same age are going to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, a false testimony in the investigation of bribery.
According to a court document submitted on Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is expected to prove falsely to federal investigators who conducted corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court case list, Robin Hayes is guilty on Wednesday.
According to the fact that he was prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes, Hayes was aware of the false statements of FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the documents based on the facts are not specified in which case Hayes admits any sin.
Hayes was initially accused of conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
The prosecutors accused Hayes of being involved in the insurance company's heavy duty plan, which was to pay for special treatment to the director of state insurance.
Two co-owners, Greg Lindberg, were accused of attempted bribes to the Secretary of Insurance in Mike Cozy.
Lindberg is the founder of insurance and investment companies and has donated more than $500 million to state and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
Lindberg supported Republican principles and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer called for a comment on Friday and email, but did not reply.
On Friday, Hans Davis, the defendant of Hayes, requested an additional comment by email, but did not reply.
The court documents submitted on Friday were described as false statements by Hayes to FBI agents in August 2018.
However, according to the fact-based document, Hayes was actually talking about a request for personnel transfer in the insurance bureau from Lindberg.
The prosecutors said that Hayes helped Lindberg's request that he would like to meet with Corgee, and spoke directly with the director.
The prosecution announced in April claimed that Lindberg would seek special treatment for his own insurance business, and that he was planning to take over $200 million to re-election in Kosey in 2020.
According to the prosecution, the conspiracy involved a request to replace the authorities who had reviewed the company in Lindberg.
Republican Corsey reported an attempted bribe to federal agents and helped them.
There is no doubt about Corsey.
In a conversation involving Lindberg and Cozie, a co-owner of Lindberg instructed Hayes to send $50,000 to Cozy's reelection campaign.
According to the prosecution, Hayes was initially opposed to paying attention if he could move so expensive money, but eventually broke out in the conversation.
In the case of prosecution, Hayes said, "What do you want?"
i know, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office requested an e-mail for further information on judicial transactions, but no response was made.
Facebook, aims to improve the user's happiness!
In the world's first attempt to raise the user's happiness, some users will soon like other people's posts!
This change followed by a similar test of Instagram in Australia in July, and it was nice!
The new Facebook attempt will begin on Friday and will soon begin in Australia.
Facebook Australia's policy manager, Mai Garrick, said that this change was based on feedback from mental health professionals that would cause a number of social comparisons.
Garrick said, "There was a very positive feedback from many bully groups and mental health groups working together."
It is only to remove numbers so that users can focus on the quality and content of the exchange, rather than the number of actions.
Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick said that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
In some countries, such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc., test the same way.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test ends or is changed.
"There was initially a positive feedback about the experience in Instagram, but now it is a step to listen to feedback and learn."
Garrick, in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very aggressive Facebook and Instagram user.
He thought Australia was a great country to get really good feedback about whether this was a valuable experience for people or not.

Self repair of broken bag fittings to otok! 【Cando】 " holder parts (ring type) " (Letus Club News) - Yahoo! News
One day, I got my favorite bag of my mother and I couldn't move somewhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to love it.
I helped him when I was in the hands of Cando.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, the neck is the ultimate pchipra.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair the repair, the price of the body was significantly exceeded.
My mother unfortunately said, "I'm not going to give up."
First of all, I went through the Home Center to find a replacement for this connected fitting.
However, even if there is a ring-shaped fitting, everything is silver.
Gold was never seen at all.
When I went to Candu, I finally found it!
I was moved when I found it in the handicraft corner.
It's 100 percent as expected.
It is originally a part used for key holders and charm DIY.
It was planned to use one by one on both ends of the bag handle and bought two pieces.
The size of the ring is small, but if you put the bag fittings on one side left, make the same thing at all ...
This opened the way to repair the bag.
It is a tight installation.
what?
The ring openings are designed to break inside and are resistant to pulling outwards.
I installed it in a bag.
The color of the metal fittings is good with the gold system ♪ However, because the ring size is small, it is difficult to move ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The amount of metal fittings has increased, but because of lightweight parts, the weight is absolutely no problem.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts has increased and the design level has improved.
Hiroshima - Kumamoto, 10 hours trip | Shizuoka Shimbun at Esss
To wait for departure at JR Hiroshima Station, a temporary train that was inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR period - 28th
People who enjoy the extraordinary train journey inspired by the express "Aso" of the JNR era = 28
A special train was operated between Hiroshima and Kumamoto on the 28th.
In the morning of the same day, about 240 people from the railway fan boarded 12 blue passenger cars from Hiroshima Station and left Kumamoto Station for about 10 hours.
In 1950-80, Aso was a night train connecting Kumamoto and Tokyo.
The service was limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of the Kumamoto Destiny Campaign, the tour was organized by JR companies.
The train consists of seven cars with passenger cars, and runs on the Sanyo Line, Chikuto Line and Kagoshima Line.

his brother was killed in the honor of a social media star in Pakistan, and his brother died in life.
Candy Baroch, who gained fame in his photos posted on social media, was hanged in July 2016.
His brother, the popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with the most attention of his father-in-law, Pakistan.
In July 2016, Baruche, famous for being provocative in Pakistan, was hanged.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
A few days later, in a press conference, his brother said that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and did not regret what he did.
The lawyer, Sardar Memoud, told AFP that the court of Murtan in the eastern city was guilty and sentenced to life in the judgment that awaited him.
He said, "Insharah (God's thoughts) will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Balochi's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that his son wanted to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Barrowchi's murder became a major news all over the world, and as a result of his father's right-of-the-art society, the victims, most women, were killed, and the so-called " honorary murders" were re-burned.
Women chose their marriage partner, and in the case of Mr. Balochi, they were burned by crimes such as praise of their sexuality and shameful family.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
Later, in Pakistan's Kisars and Deya (retribution) laws, the perpetrators can be forgiven from their relatives.
Three months after Burrought's murder, Congress passed a new bill that required a life sentence to honor murder.
However, whether the murder is an honorable crime is at the discretion of the judge, the killer may claim another motive in theory and be pardoned.
In the case of Mr. Balochi, his parents initially insisted not to forgive his son.
However, when he lost his son, his sad parents changed their thoughts and asked him to forgive his son.
In response to the international dislike of killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented measures to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
His famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket Team and wearing a straight red dress on Valentine's Day.
Although it became critical and threatening, it was recognized by many people, including young people, when it opened a new heaven and earth in a country where it was considered a political activity to enhance the status of women boldly and to express itself as a presence like Kim Kadasian.
The origins of the " Honorary" murder are ethnic social norms, and are still widespread in South Asia, especially in women's actions, but men may be victims.

[ASA Amami Sports Academy, NPO ASA Amami Sports Academy (President Akira Noda, Amami City) and Okinaga Sports Club ELOVE (President Junya Maeda and Chinamachi) signed a partnership on 25th.
In addition to actively collaborating with the two organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will also establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injuries such as when children from remote islands visit the island.
When the two organizations conduct training related to sports, they can mediate and dispatch exclusive trainers and instructors, and share information.
When a team of remote islands expedition outside the island, they will work to resolve issues such as the difficulty of the trainers in terms of travel costs.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Prefectural Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in the event of a tournament in the mainland, such as the prefectural tournament, the support is to prevent the performance of the players due to fatigue during a boat trip or night.
In addition, during the tournament on Amami Oshima Island and Okinagarabe Island, he cooperated with local rectals and hospital officials to support players from outside the island.

Kenichiro Shigeki "It is now a time when traditional common sense is broken."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
In fact, as a brain scientist, Kenichiro Shigeki has been thinking twice about "mote."
The brain science theory is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will send you a piece later.
In the previous section (see related article), Mote-no-Otoko firmly adheres to the traditional "Man's Fantasy" and the pattern learning for Mote is overwhelmingly insufficient!
In the later part, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad man and become a cool, mote man.
if you're stuck with it, you're going to live.
In the first part, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and people's behavior.
When learning patterns, I think the brain will be able to systematically organize actions in such a situation.
I think I'm still evolving every day as if I'm not going to "mote."
That's why it's cool to live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and the Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned many patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, it might be a bit painful to say that the teacher of the university is more dignified.
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say that you should do this or what you should do, you will live.
Because people and society change even if they don't change themselves.
I talked about that in my recent talk book, "No matter how terrible it is in the world."
It is something that naturally comes out with the recognition of the people around them as "strongness" and "power."
It's not that easy.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
I don't think Mr. Takechi was doing this at the Cannes Film Festival.
Although he was light, he would be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a track record do not have to act greatly.
In other words, you can't make it lightly if you are bound by the "thinkness."
As long as I heard many women, regardless of their position or age, I would like to be relieved and saved by any man.
It is difficult to see what this "be cute" is.
what is it? (laughter)
In the northwestern part of Nigeria, the number of refugees doubled to 40,000: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the UN's announcement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled by about 40,000 due to the intensifying violence in the last four months.
According to the United Nations Refugee Organization, a new humanitarian crisis is created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, each institution will work together to raise USD 35.5 million.
The spokesman for the UNHCR said that the Islamic extremist Bokohalam, which had been active in the northern part of Nigeria for ten years, was unrelated to several recent armed attacks.
Rather, violent violence in Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina during the last ten months was organized by armed groups.
"We look at the horrors of illegal and unstable situations," said Barrok.
Abducts, tortures, assaults, murders and sexual violence have often occurred, and the attackers are working to destroy their homes and thefts.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with the West African branch of Islamic State, which split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," he says.
What they are carrying is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees passed to neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the next few months.
the new trial date for men who murdered two women and children is confirmed.
The trial date of the Guatemalan men who were killed by two women and their children in Iowa was confirmed.
According to the Pork County Court records, Marvin Escorbal Orilena (31) was prosecuted for first-class murders in three cases, a false name named Marvin Esquibel Lopez, who was initially admitted by the authorities.
He claims innocence.
According to the police, on July 16, he was shot dead by Rossives Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and son (5).
In the court's records, a new date of trial will be decided on 27 January, and the time will be given to both the plaintiffs and defendants for further preparation.
According to U.S. Immigration Bureau officials, Escobal Orilena was illegally staying in the United States and was forced back twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal immigration to the United States in 2010.
The Sonet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising on header bindings by Presidency.js.
LFP provides services that meet the needs of advertisers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks.
The Service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Headboarding is a mechanism that allows the media to deliver high-priced ads to media operated by media by fair bidding competition with multiple vendors.
As a solution for media companies that are transparent and are expected to improve profitability, the introduction of large media is progressing.
Until now, SSP has been provided for advertising.
In order to respond to requests from advertisers in recent years, "I want to deliver to a specific advertising frame with high affinity with individual commercial materials and brand images," the LFP began in December last year with the cooperation of media companies to directly purchase advertising frames that meet the needs of advertisers.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header bindings allow them to participate in bids for direct header binding ads, which can be expected to improve their advertising delivery opportunities.
In addition, due to limited media coverage, the advertising framework for distributions along with individual commercial materials and brand images is secured to prevent brand value damage.
The benefit of media companies is that it is possible to work closely with the hope of the introduction of media companies by a solution that manages the code of Vider companies, called "Lapper Solution," which LFP promotes collaboration.

Two months later, Assistant Professor Yamagata stopped at Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced that an assistant professor at the U.S. Sawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Department of General Affairs, in October 2017, when a male assistant taught multiple students belonging to the laboratory, he was emotionally emotional and abused in inappropriate words.
He was a professor of education and was certified to deteriorate the learning environment.
In a survey conducted in September 1818, several students appealed.
In December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and in December of the same year, they conducted research on harassment prevention measures by teachers at the Yonezawa Campus, and finally filed harassment from one student.
In response to the findings from the committee, he decided to disciplinary action at the board of directors by the President and the director.
After the survey, the assistant professor continued to teach, but through the interview, his actions were improved and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama said, "I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the victims and the people involved, and I would like to take all my studies to prevent harassment and to try to recover confidence."
At the same time, an internal investigation of the alleged sexual harassment of female students led by men's faculty of the Faculty of Engineering is also underway.
Cabinet revolts The Sun Paper demands Boris Johnson to reduce EU withdrawal requests and compromise with the EU.
Now, only three weeks after the EU summit, which is a settlement, there is a growing concern around the Prime Minister that the prime minister might not be able to withdraw significantly.
Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion in the Cabinet that seeks to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and bring compromises with the EU.
The negotiations on a new tariff system to replace the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are packed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "impactable."
The Senior Ministers hoped that the EU's black curtains led by the German Prime Minister Angela Merkel would propose compromises on the ground floor, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers, who were ready to face the Prime Minister after the Conservatives' annual meeting in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the " extremity" strategy that threatens the EU invented by the senior advisor Dominique Camings without agreement, and insists that the EU will accept the offer to bring out restrictions.
One Cabinet said that the ruling that the Supreme Court was illegal on Tuesday was "the alarm bell," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House of Representatives, and they oppose us.
The Prime Minister must use what can be used more than a step.
It is not effective even if it is radical, and the plan of Camationus is clearly unsuccessful.
It is impossible to fight in many areas.
Another cabinet promised to speak to Johnson to carry out an agreement with Prime Minister Terrysa May.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I would like to tell Boris to return Terryza's agreement to the House."
As a result, there are a number of people who are trying to end this.
If there is no delay, Boris is over and we are all over.
Sir John Mayer condemned Boris not seriously thinking about negotiations.
"The Prime Minister wants to connect with the EU," he said.
However, we do not look at the fact that the Prime Minister will establish an agreement on the seat of talks with the EU.
Instead, we saw that in Scotland, the Prime Minister fought with the bulls, inspected the eggs in the Uerres, and discussed with the people in the streets, as if the elections were full.
The Prime Minister's press acknowledged that the agreement was still a long time ago, and said, "If no one wants to achieve the goal, the road is still long."
However, the press also stated that the Ben Bill, which forced a three-month postponement, would significantly weaken the position of our negotiations in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue their progress despite the establishment of the bill."
He returned to Brussels today to discuss further with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two discuss how the regulation of all Irish islands on food and livestock works.
Lorraine Kelly: I was told that Glasgow accent would never be a success in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, revealed that he was told by the TV station boss that he would never succeed.
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, who was 59 years old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I was working as a surveyor at the BBC Scotland branch, and from my boss, I was told that your Glasgow accent would not succeed in the absolute television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewed by legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe that I was in the same room as the living legend.
I found out that my place was here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a TV-am Scottish reporter in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as the host of the show on GMTV and ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and then began a program named after her.
In commemoration of the 35th anniversary, Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews were broadcast.
He added that passion, enthusiasm, and curiosity were the secret to survival in the television industry, and that the host said, "We have to put it into work."
It must be honest and sincere.
I am interested in various people and interested in what I should do.
Looking back on the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that it was "very painful."
On the day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think we could see many of the families of children who were killed or injured who broadcast the show from Dunbulane.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna's daughter, told me to see me personally, so we talked for hours at her home.
I went to Joanna's funeral and Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed the couple when Kate and Gerry McKan's daughter Maddenlain were missing, saying that it was "very hard" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets that do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple is not really a poison.
The 35th anniversary of Lorraine was broadcast from 8:30 on Monday, September 30.
tywenga, fearing traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantine Chiwenga declined due to concerns that the offer of President Robert Mugabe, who had been in the midst of a political change, might be a trap to follow military action in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the Defense Forces continued, and Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give the presidency, and last week the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper reported.
However, the reason why Chiwenga rejected the offer is that he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of the regime in a coup rather than anxiety.
According to a series of Twitters that the authorities confirmed that they were senior officials of the Cabinet Office, Mugabe, who had held the administration for 37 years, was positive not to Emerson Munangagwa, but to give the administration to Chiwenga, and a fierce negotiation was made at that time.
Mugabe, who realized that he was losing power, told the government officials that he had made contact with the envoy to Chiwenga.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was conducted by three.
George Charanba, president of Spokesman, and his high-ranking officials said that Aaron Nepela, the top representative of the Central Information Organization at that time, and Fidelis Mukonoli, a Roman Catholic bishop, were involved in negotiations.
Gideon Gono, former president of the Zimbabwe Preparatory Bank, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to commander Chiwenga.
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, failed to attempt to blame the African Union for military action while seeking intervention by African leaders.
The offer to give the presidency to former CDF (the commander of Chiwenga) was not due to the selection of former presidents.
"Some of the deceased's families began to suffer from fatigue, and it was a wasteful action to save the rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, at least diplomatically alone, the political aim of the late president was a little bit.
If there was something that would destroy the constitutional order, it would have been to clash with the views of the African Union on the coup, but I would like you to remember that the commander had declared that it would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President (Mgabe) hoped that Chiwenga, who was the top of the military at that time, would trap the claims of commanders who claimed to have not broken the constitutional order.
The African Union, which had not yet fully grasped the entire situation, wanted to be considered a valid military intervention request, even though it was ultimately called a coup.
It was intended and calculated at the bottom of the offer.
When he realized that he was not protected by the defense forces, Mugabe was moving, and officials speak.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe was forced to write his resignation.
The military commanders told Mugabe that even if they had invaded the president's house, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that time, Mugabe wanted two things to protect his family and prove power deprivation by the military.
The commander and commanders at that time read exactly what they intended.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa" (which we belong to the military department) were used to express powerful metaphors that we were not politicians but only in political competition," said the government officials.
The army told the local commanders that through the military commanders who stayed in Zimbabwe, the purpose was to remove the "criminals" surrounding him rather than to defeat Mugabe.
In order to discuss the coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to call Munangaguwa, a short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the Southern African Development Community at that time, South Africans refused to intervene, but as they were repeatedly threatened behind it, the South African army would immediately be sent to Harare.
"Just because it wasn't supported by President Putin and the African leaders, it was not possible to achieve it," he said.
The United Nations Appeals for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons The ratification of the treaty in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun
[New York Joint] On the 26th of the United Nations Headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and the grandchild of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (now Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) gave a speech to Dr. Takeuchi (63), the second generation of the atomic bomb, to support the treaty.
The new five countries ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratified it in 32 countries.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
Meetings and ratifications were made to coincide with the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons.
In recent years, Secretary-General Guterres also expressed strong concern that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation have been reversed.
"There is no other way to eliminate."
China needs strong leadership, and if there is no need for collapse, policy documents
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday, prior to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In the White Paper, the Chinese State Council said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and the domestic situation is complicated, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified and powerful leadership, China would go to division and collapse and be a disaster for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long been justified in dealing with problems in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratization movement that occurred in Beijing in 1989.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, held the government in late 2012.
He also directed a military modernization program that threatened the region.
The policy document states that China does not intend to export its own development model, nor does it intend to incorporate models of other countries, but merely seek peace.
Among the genes of the Chinese people, there is no aggression or world control.
In modern times, China was bullied from the strength of the column, and war and confusion left a deep scar with its pain; China would never bear the pain that he experienced.
China is facing difficult issues such as the economic downturn and the anti-government movement in Hong Kong in China.
China will never abandon its core interests and will not allow the loss of security and sovereignty.
"The tariffs that continue to rise with the threat of trade war do not solve any problem," says White Paper in relation to trade disputes with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with the momentum of complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market spaces and strong economic development.
"It will never weaken in the trade war."
I am confident that China is facing difficulties, changing the crisis to a chance, and opening a new world.
As China does not have any idea to counter the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., the United States should calmly capture the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely to stop China's development.
The U.S. will not maintain its strength if it is to suppress, suppress, and move the contradictions of other countries abroad.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka dismissed Hirata's director, Kinko's chief, and the news was revealed (Sport News) - Yahoo!
On the 28th of spring summer, Yokohama Taka, a famous high school baseball player who won five national championships, announced that Toru Hirata (36) and Masao Kaneko (42) were dismissed on the same day.
In the future, Oteru Takayama will be acting as a coach and the director (responsor teacher) will be determined promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that the local paper had a crush on the baseball team.
When the school heard the situation from two people, the director Hirata grabbed the student's neck and the director Kimko admitted some of the rumors.
In addition, due to the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two again confirmed the facts, and the fact was generally accepted and dismissed on 28 December.
In the summer of Yokohama, Motochika WATANABE (74) who raised Shosaka Daisuke (present-day Nakaday) was bravely defeated.
He was the director of Hirata and the director of Kaneko.
He competed in the Kokoen Garden for three consecutive years from the summer of 16th to the present spring Senbatsu.
However, when he lost to Sagamihara in the semi-finals in the summer, he was defeated by Kiriko Gakuen in the semi-finals and was desperate for the next spring.
The Spice Girls' MelC, the Severage Disturbance, and the diet topic in their homes.
The Spice Girls' Melannie Chizom, who had been unable to eat anything other than fruits and vegetables for many years, acknowledged that diet was prohibited at home.
The sporty spice was diagnosed with depression and eating disorder after long periods of exercise without having enough meals under pressure from members of the global pop group.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by the child care of his daughter Scarlett, stating that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old and I'm getting distracted by my appearance."
But because I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when I talked with my daughter.
A positive word, now it is a habit.
In the 1990s, when he gained fame as a member of Spice Girls, he was still in the front of SNSdai, when his "bad" comment on the media led to a physical issue, Mel told in an interview with Women's Health magazine.
"I couldn't take care of myself, and I didn't have a particular food group, and I became more aware of the exercise, and it was too thin."
I was sick of my condition, and that condition lasted almost a few years."
The Court of Appeals for Marriage: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court Maoka Branch acknowledged this in a case where "in fact marriage" in accordance with marriage was a dispute between the same sex.
There are over 20 countries that recognize the same-sex marriage, and there is no legal effect in the country.
Based on this, the decision was approved by two women.
It is considered the first judicial decision to have legal protection against the same-sex couples and is meaningful.
As a result of the provisions of the Civil Code and the Family Register Act, a lawsuit against a country seeking compensation is conducted in five local courts such as Sapporo.
In order to overcome the judgment, I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights of a few sexual minorities, and deepen the discussion of the legal system to recognize diverse families.
Women lived in the United States for about seven years, and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The decision was certified as "the reality of marriage between men and women" due to the achievements of the two living together.
It is a revolutionary decision to expand the recognition of marriage with the right to follow marriage in social insurance.
What is more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution to "free marriage" as the marriage "only based on the mutual agreement."
It is said that both sexes were not considered same-sex marriages at the time of the establishment, and that the purpose of denying marriage is not solved.
"The Constitution is not supposed to be a same-sex marriage," but it is expected to be a driving force for the same-sex marriage lawsuits in various regions.
On the other hand, due to the lack of same-sex marriage, the problem was that "the benefits of legal protection differ between men and women" was reduced.
While recognizing the same situation as between men and women, it may not be possible to distinguish the right to protect.
According to the National Family Trend Survey for married women, about 70% of those who should be admitted by law have changed their consciousness.
While the diversification of lifestyle continues, the law is bound by traditional family statues to take away the rights of those who are not fit.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" who admits the law, so there are still few restrictions, such as lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and lack of co-parent rights.
In consideration of the same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from various viewpoints, such as not only marriage between the same sex, but also the expansion of legal rights of marriage.
the trial of the former athletes accused of rape of multiple women, the jury trial
A jury trial was held at the former University of Delaware, where several women were prosecuted for sexual assault.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and speech, the jury began to review the fate of Clay Conaway 23.
A 21-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted after sending her to her home by car.
The two met each other in the dating site Bunbble for three weeks, when Conaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway was asked for sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when Conaway attempted to assault the woman by escalating the hug on the consent.
The defense argued that women's contradictions and memories were different and that women were reluctant to have physical relationships.
【Hiroshima】Ogata Director and his departure remarks, "The next season is the Penantate," - Yahoo! News
At the end of the season, the 3rd and Hiroshima lost the chance to enter CS with their own power.
If the 4th and 3rd remaining wins, the position will be replaced.
In the ceremony after the match, the director of Ogata Ko City (50) said, "I didn't win the final match and couldn't confirm the ranking.
He was caught by some fans.
At the end of the speech, he said, "I will do my best to steal Penant in the coming season," suggesting his own continuation.
At the end of the ceremony, however, when the press was asked about the point, "I'm not finished yet, so I'm not going to finish it."
[DOSPO] Ota was the first to be transferred to Hokkaido Shimbun, and he succeeded in receiving the teachings of Sanematsu & G Abe.
He became a "dead" to seniors.
He took the lead four times, and on the left side, he made his 20th home run.
I reached the number of home runs that I had targeted, "I stopped receiving this number and tried to do it again, and I became a big one."
His intention was also firm.
It was the first time since the transfer was made.
He said, "I put it in the fourth place to swing."
Oda responded to his expectations: "I felt so excited and entered the game, and I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the four ideal statues is the giant Abe who retired from active service in the season.
"The 4th is the core to lead the victory, and the 4th of the team is the 4th, and the 4th seniors who have seen the giants were."
Among them, "I think Abe's appearance is the best, and it was a kind of dependable existence, and I looked at that back and became my style."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, and the video clearly
Among Sydney's tourism resources, which will bring $290 million to the Australian economy every year, Sydney Harbour is the largest contributor to the opera house, Sircula Key, Luna Park, and the famous Harbour Bridge.
But under the bridge there is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of the worst waterways in Australia, where about 15 cups of contaminants flow every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist spots is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video from Sydney Harbor to the bottom of the title, the waterway around the most popular city in Australia has a lot of mussels, plastic bags, plastic bottles, shoes and clothes that someone has lost, and even animal dead bodies - all flowing into Sydney Harbour by rainwater.
Among them, the biggest factor to break the waterway is plastic.
Dr. Catherine Dufour, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is a paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but one of Japan's coastlines is quite altered and contaminated.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbor via rainwater drainage.
"The heavy rain fell several times, but after that, Sydney Harbour was quite tragic," Dr. Daffon said.
Two-thirds of the pollution flowed from rainwater.
However, in a corner of the iceberg, 70 percent of plastics flowing into the ocean are deposited in the seabed.
"I really don't know what to do if I don't go down the sea level, but I don't know what the truth is there," said David Center Manley, owner and owner Richard Nicols, who will collect about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year alone in their team.
If a lot of people know more (what is there under the water surface), I think everyone is really cool.
It's overwhelming, but more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
The remaining half is used at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone that all plastics and garbage flows down the water.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of Ocean Protect, said that local residents may also be able to reduce plastic and garbage flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source of origin.
We need to reduce the use of plastics, recycle more well, and eventually flow into the sea, so we need to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
The 50 percent of oxygen we suck comes from the ocean, and the pain in the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide and is a source of food.
However, we repair Sydney Harbour and return it to the old scene, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing people.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also announced this month, as part of the activities that the Australian public would widely know about environmental protection and the reduction of the effects of beverage containers remaining in the natural environment.
According to a new survey, 82 percent of the 546 children aged 12 to 18 have a sense of despair about plastic waste and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is an adult.
In the same study, the problem of plastic waste for parents was ranked fourth among concerns, and the researchers reported that 93 percent of the parents in 551 were increasingly anxious about the amount of plastic waste in the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
Former Karatsu Power Station in October | Saga News | Saga Shimbun
From October to October, the construction of the former Karatsu power plant began.
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power generation) located in Futako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantlement was two used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
One chimney is split from the top of the tower crane and dismantled.
The plan takes nine months to break down each other and takes 18 months.
The remaining turbine builders and boilers were not destroyed.
In his 60s, a man who runs a restaurant nearby said, "If you look back from afar and see a chimney, it's like a symbol that gives you the feeling of returning to Karatsu."
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because there is a nearby Yacht Harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three additional nine electric power companies signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.
Product development with local fish Sales such as O eagle Taka Fishnut Mie - Ise Shimbun
[Students who promote fishnaggets and rice cooked in Thailand]
[O eagle] Four third-year-olds from the Department of Information Business, Tateo Eagle High School in Kodono-cho, Owashi City, Mie Prefecture developed fish meat and rice cooked in Thailand using locally fried fish.

The school began in June.
They visited factories from Oiwamono and deepened their understanding of the water industry.
At the workshop, we talked about the needs of consumers and tried prototypes.
He also invented naggets using a hydrangea, but he adopted mutts because he had a peculiar smell of fish.
Mr. Masaki Yamaguchi (17) said, "It's a product that can be eaten by people who don't like fish, and I'm happy if you eat lots of people."
It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell their products.
It's because I'm a fan of love (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, a freelance announcer, Shinma Takahashi, on Monday of CBC TV, told his master.
the advice of the master who saved me who was rotten
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a master beyond his father.
In the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I don't know what I'm doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry and how important it is as a working person.
When he was told to be an announcer of the TV station, he was told to be a television announcer, and when he was hurt, he said, "I didn't think that's the case, but Mama was said to be in power."
At the time of the second and third year of the company, when I joined the company, I had only a job called "Anyone with an empty girl Anna is good," and when I wasn't motivated by what I wanted to do, but when I was humiliating my mind, "If anyone wanted to do it, I would like to do it, but I was glad to be in charge of Mama."
i learned naturally from my father's play.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but in fact, after joining the TV station, I've been exposed to news all over the years with the narration of BS and news shows.
I was thinking that the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko deluxe was very happy to have evaluated the news reading of Mama.
When I read the news, I feel that it is important and sensed.
It has been cultivated by watching his father's stage, film, television, and drama in his childhood.
In other words, I think that it is thanks to my father because there are many experiences of my childhood, such as how to make and respond on a variety show.

First held in Aichi and Gifu Prefecture - Yahoo! News
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The International Automobile Federation announced on September 27, 2019 that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on November 22, 2020.
Looking back at the past WRC World Rally Championship with images!

The final event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is the WRC that will be revived in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship are held.
Since 1973, it has become the world's highest rally in history and tradition, and it is said to be the most severe car racing championship because the competition is not only closed public roads, but also gravel roads and snow roads.
In the second season of the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title since 1999.
This time, the Japan Round Preparedness Committee was established to host Japan.
As a result, it was decided that the 2020 WRC Japan Round will be held at the World Motorsport Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
Mr. Akio Toyoda (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.) is talking about the Japan Round as follows.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the 2020 FIA World Rally Championship to be held in Japan, and we will work together with stakeholders to make a big appeal to the world as one of Japan's leading motorsport centers."

is the key to cancer treatment?
Tusmaniadeville may have the key to cancer treatment - researchers have opened a breakthrough that could bring great reform to patient treatment.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells were camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmaniadeville and humans.
In this discovery, we expect a new way to treat cancer patients.
What is common with Tasmaniadeville and humans?
It is a cancer cell that cannot be seen.
A team of researchers at the Peter McClellon Cancer Center in Melbourne found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to working on a deadly face tumor that threatens the future of Tasmaniadeville near extinction.
In this study, some cancer cells in humans and bags used a series of proteins called PRC2 to cause markers to react and the immune system would not attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a kind of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and Merkel cells.
Prof. Mark Dowson, a researcher at the Peter McClem column, told AAP that "the very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Reuse conventional therapies, revitalizing markers, which are known as MHCs, may enable the immune system to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a considerable impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Doson said.
"The lung cancer is an epidemic in the world.
And it may be possible to treat in a much better way.
Researchers expect this discovery to eventually be used to treat the face-to-face tumor of Tasmaniadeville, where cancer cells escape detection.
"It's amazing that the same process will happen at all (in the Gun of Human and Tasmaniadeville).
"It was very hard to treat Tusmaniadeville tumor.
However, if a drug that is effective for humans can be used in Tasmaniadeville, it may be useful to control the tumor."
scientists and scientists are also confused with a giant planet orbiting a polar star.
Scientists have discovered and surprised the solar system, covering the current understanding of planetary formation, which orbits a giant Jupiter-shaped planet around a small star called red dwarf, 30 light years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of a giant gas planet GJ3512b orbiting a red dwarf star was released.
The star is usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around it.
However, in this case, there is no difference in the size of stars and planets, and researchers said on Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"That's another surprise," said Juan Carlos Morales, an astronomical physicist at the Institute of Space Studies, Catalonia, who led this research in the scientific journal Science.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we found a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Coloral Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star and takes about 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only much smaller than our Sun, but also roughly the same size as the giant planet, only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, the surface temperature is much lower than the sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 ( degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees / 3527 degrees Celsius).
That's why it's red."
On the other hand, while the second planet orbits the star, the third planet may have been released from its star system in the past.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gases and dust that generate stars orbiting themselves.
In the most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core integrated" model, the object is generated from solid particles in the disc, and the surrounding gas becomes atmosphere by pulling the eggs of the planet.
This unusual planetary system can be explained using a conflict model called a self-gravity instability model.
"In this case, the primitive planetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature was lower."
As the disc becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses may grow until they collapse and form planets.
i'm going to eat a soy dip with a delicate employee and a stimulant.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernández (38) is accused of eating dipping beans with wake-up agents to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Animina Hernández (38) was accused of transferring methane fetamin and taking regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were caused by an incident occurred at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to the estimate of the oath issued by OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked me to make a little taste because Medina Hernández saw the bean dip.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane fetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a good drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach was poor and her legs were fluffy.
According to the Albanie Democrat Herald, a local hospital where a woman visited was judged to have included methane phetamine in the beans dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said that Medina Hernández told the victim's food, while the third employee told the police that the suspect had sent a message that he had accidentally put methane fetamin into beans.
According to the Oregon Live article, the surveillance video that was seized by Deli shows that Medina Hernández is in the back of the camera and in the back of the microwave.
It is said that he was standing up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table to put the beans dip in a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff said that there were no customers who had contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was imprisoned in Marion County instead of $52 million in bail.
According to the Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest records of Medina Hernández include assaults, robbery, suffrage, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of control weapons.

Michelle Obama, instagram, praised megan mark as inspiration.
On Thursday, Michelle Obama highly evaluated Megan Markle in a favorable Instagram, calling the Duke of Sassex "a thoughtful leader who would break the type and better the world."
The Duchess and Prince Harry met with his son Arche Harrison Mountbatten-Winzer at the reception of young people in South Africa this week.
The former president, Mrs. Gen., wrote a very favorable post, saying, "I want to break the old customs and make the world better, thanks to my friend, Princess Sassex.
Mrs. Obama published a photo of Mrs. Megan, who poses with the Foundation's executives, adding that "even with the Obama Foundation executives, the support of girls around the world who seek appropriate education is stimulating to many."
She was a former "suit" actress and guest editor in the September issue of Vogue magazine, and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In a frank conversation, Mrs. Motonaga recalled how his mother and mother changed.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "It's like being a mother is in an advanced class to let go."
My job was almost always as my mother to find out what the children want to do and keep the right distance to grow.
In order to find out who they are, in essence, are not the ideals for children as parents or the aspirations of their childhood.
The wife of Obama, who actually knows the pressure on spotlights in the world, advised her little by little by little by little in the interview of Good Housekeeping magazine.
Sometimes, the pressure from myself and people around me can be felt too large.
So it's my biggest advice that I don't have time to do anything.
In the first few months of the White House, instead of starting to work ambitiously, the girls began to live in school well and were distracted by new friends.
Still good, I think it's better.

Trump Hotel owner's right complaint, liquor sales permit is held.
Washington (AP) - Washington's Alcohol and Beverage Commission (AP) dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the license to sell liquor at the local Trump International Hotel because the owner's rightness was questioned.
On Wednesday, the Commission filed a complaint with three members, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders, with most of the petitioners not living in Washington or having no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, it is the second time that an appeal to cancel the right to provide alcohol in the hotel is based on a state law that requires the applicant to obtain a license for sale of alcohol.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year showed repeated deceptions against President Trump's assault and violated the state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This was the second time the petition was issued to update the permit.
It is the first harvest of honey collected by the honey bee "Five Bees" breeders of Bentley!
How about the taste of honey collected by FlyingBees who are bred on the knees of the Flying B?
In May 2019, a set-up bee was started at the Crew Plant in Bentley, UK, and the first honey was harvested in September of the same year.
More than 100 bottles of honey were collected from only two nests.
Why did Bentray bee on the factory grounds where cars were assembled?
I want to taste this!
Here are 11 honeys made by Bentley.
Peter Bosch, director of Bentley's manufacturing division, commented as follows.
"The aim of contributing to the conservation of biodiversity in the region was to establish a nest for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant.
The beekeepers watched the scene from the wildflowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains where the bees are gathering various flowers.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have such a harvest in the first year.
Bentley has been working on a wide range of activities as much as possible to the top of sustainable luxury automobile manufacturers through the crew factory and our business.
Staff are actively cooperating.
It is very pleased that the first harvest was successfully harvested, and we plan to install more nests next year and increase the harvest of beet honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to play our role."In May 2019, 12 million honeybees began.
And in September of the same year, after the summer of the same year, it was completed to remove the nest from the nest box.
The bottle and package of honey can also be seen as Bentley's specialty.
The label design was designed by Louise Mass column, designer responsible for the interior of Bentley.
The bottled honey is not only delivered to the staff but also given a gift to important customers and customers who visit the crew factory.

The Cleveland Police, which continues to scandal, is said to be the worst in the UK in a violent report.
The police, who continued the scandal, were accused of being the worst in Britain.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud in all areas inappropriately.
In the Cleveland Police, Phil Gomley of the Police Department continues to "a serious deterioration."
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and now they are facing new calls for demolition.
According to the report, he was reluctant to stop crimes, arrest suspects, and protect socially vulnerable persons.
The police officer Phil Gomley said, "It's been a long time since we finally investigated it."
Mike Vil, the police chief, resigned in January less than a year before his appointment, but he was "deep" about his actions, but was investigated for multiple charges that were not published.
The deputy director, Adrian Roberts, was arrested for serious illegal acts and suspended.
Captain Simon Harwood, who was in charge of sexual activity last year, went to the illegal investigation committee for reasons that he was involved in sexual activity.
He resigned from the police.
The Conservative mayor of Teas Valley Ben Howin said: "This is a formal verification of the collapse of the police.
This is when the Interior Ministry intervenes."
Richard Lewis, head of the police station, said, "It has been improved, but I am responsible for advancing reforms."
Nancy Pelosi: William Bar was a "criminal" and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what's going on.
At present, we believe that we are involved in a cover-up case, and it may take some time to investigate."
"I'm going to do my work based on the time to find facts and facts," said Pelosi.
This week's White House records revealed that Trump asked President Vladimir Zellensky of Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son before the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
According to a call record, Trump also found that he was asked to help Mr. Bar and his personal adviser, Lucy Giulini.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine for more than a week before formal inquiries, reports Thursday.
The Ministry of Justice, accused of inquiries from information agencies, determined that Trump's telephone talks would not be covered by political financing violations.
In response to the question that Bar should testify, Pelosi stated on Friday that the intelligence special committee would decide who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he was a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"It was the name of the bar from beginning to end," said Pelosi, who touched on Trump's name on the phone talks with the Ukrainian president in July.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be subject to judgment regarding the removal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said that he was "very concerned" when Trump attacked the accused on Thursday as a spy.
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Pelosi said that the internal accusations play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about those who could provide information to the whistleblowers is a significant loss in the government."
Mr. Pelosi, on Tuesday, spoke of the suspicions that he had tried to pressure foreign leaders for political benefit, and announced that Trump would formally impeachment and wrote a historical step.
The call content is included in the accusations released on Thursday, and the internal accusations claim that Trump abused his office in the next 2020 presidential election to seek intervention in Ukraine.
The accused also claimed that the White House advisers instructed officials to remove calls from the cabinet-level computer system and replace them with special sensitive systems.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the review committee
Cofi Manuel, a football administrator and executive at Secondi Hasccus, expressed concern about the composition of the next Ghana Football Association (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davis, and expressed dissatisfaction with it.
In the interview with GNA Sport, Mr. Manuel stated that he had an interest in the results of the review process, and that it was fair to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from outside the previously uninterested outside of the Committee.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Parma about 10% compensation.
He is also known as Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, he argued that the commission of the jury should not be allowed because he had interests.
Mr. Manuel suggests that if a member of the Olympic Committee, Fred Papoe, attends the Committee, a conflict of interest would arise from the relationship between the club and the chairman.
The members of the committee were scheduled to begin activities yesterday after the inauguration of the ceremony at the GFAAkra Secretariat on September 19.
The chairman is Frank Davis, a corporate governance consultant, and a member of the lawyer Marian Barano and Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales, and lawyer Richard Akpocavi.
The survey found that 54-2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture believed that the minimum wage should be 1,000 yen.
In FY2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the number of scheduled jobs was around 50% of new graduates and regular employees.
The number of companies who answered "approved" to raise the yen was 100 percent, construction (70-6%) and wholesale (61-7%).
The majority of the respondents were manufacturing (51, 9 percent) and service businesses (60,9 percent), including food and lodging, and transportation industry was in favor.
"There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and increase labor costs," he said.
The average amount of money was 895 yen (from 4 October to 829 yen in Fukui Prefecture).
After hearing the employment status of the company in March 19, the new employment of regular employees was 61,3 percent, while mid-term employment was 54,5 percent, and non-regular employment was conducted by 154%.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the number was 44,7 percent, 50 and 3 percent, and non-regular remained 31 and 1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (three-thirds of new graduates, 37 and 5 percent) and construction (24,1 percent of new graduates, 38 and 1 percent) struggled.
In order to increase the number of applicants, 86 percent of the total number of applicants had problems in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the company's reputation was low.
As a measure to ask the government for adoption activities, there were many voices seeking to strengthen the introduction function and provide information for the adoption of new graduates (in three years after graduation) and mid-term employment.
There were also opinions to support students' approach, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-business and/or business proposed in the growth strategy replied, "I already accept it."
In addition to 20 and 3% of "I'm going to admit in the future," one third of the total acceptance attitude was expressed.
The companies that "not admitted" were 64-4%, with construction (82,8 percent), retail (73,1 percent), and manufacturing (72,7 percent).
The survey was conducted from 19 July to 2 August for 1,000 member companies.

the voice of Tiprick before the battle with the wealthy
Justin Tiprick said, "It's a place to show you now," when Wales came to the World Cup Tenoyama and Australia to determine the future of the tournament.
If Wales won the Walladads, it would become the most hot winner of the Pool D, perhaps the semi-final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia's 15-game victory over Wales was 14th, Tiprick and his team were one of the best eight races in England.
"It's natural, I want to challenge both teams and win at the top of the group."
The fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win in the autumn of last year.
Australia thinks it will be a lot of blame for returning the loan, but until it is hard to win it again.
Before I came here, I knew that this game was a mountain.
And I came here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, won only one victory in the previous World Cup, and the victory to Walla Beads was 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gattland, the team's total score for the 3rd Southern Hemisphere weight class was only 7 in 41 rounds.
Wales stopped 13th in the November Test Match Australia match last year, but Tiprick included several representative members who won the match 9-6 and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
He said, "It's hard to answer."
Indeed, the game was tough, and maybe I thought that everyone would win, but I didn't know well.
As a result, I had about 15 points in the final game, so I seemed to have been much more competitive than actually."
To win Wales, the key is the combination of Australia, which is worshiped as Back Lo, Michael Hopper and David Pocock, and the breakdown battle with Tiprick.
Tiprick, who had previously played 67 international matches, has experienced several matches and two players in the past.
"They are definitely a world-class backs player," he says.
When you face the world glass backrow, you always know that you're going to face a tough game.
They are always the world's highest level.
I am fully aware of what kind of game will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in defensive battles, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs, but it can be said that he knows more about rugby in terms of having to go to the necessary place.
I want to increase myself by fighting with the best players in the world, even though I'm not so strong.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against them, you have to keep yourself up.
I don't say this Sunday is the final level, but it's an important match for us.
the momentum is important.
If you continue to build a good performance, you will be able to play a game that will not be lost in the momentum.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo has '90 percent of gala', would it be a gift from the performers?
A series of problems with Yoshimoto Kogyo, which triggered the dark business of antisocial forces, have also been closed.
At the meeting on July 22, President Akihiko Okamoto said, "The company is 9 and there is no talent at all."
If the ratio of "9:1" is 90 percent, it is considered that there was a gift from a performer to Yoshimoto, and the view of investors that taxed it is also flowed on Twitter, and more than 30,000 retweets have been released.
If Galla's withdrawal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was asked by Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not eligible for the gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual, it is not subject to a gift tax first.
If the amount of work for 100 million yen was "9:1," Yoshimoto's sales were ¥100,000, and the profit of ¥90 million in the cost of 10 million.
This is the subject of corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax declarations and already pay corporate tax.
In addition, even if you're wondering about allocation, it doesn't mean that the amount you actually receive is different from the amount you want to receive.
And I think the amount I received will be declared as sales.
The gift shall not be gifted even if the opponent was an individual if the performer did not recognize it.
It is a matter of calculating taxes if you make transactions with prices that are clearly priced (e.g., real estate sales, etc.) away from the original price for tax avoidance purposes.
However, as this time, a third party will not be able to determine how much tax appropriate prices are for those who have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think that one yen payment book is a poison.
[Interview Cooperation Tax Rishi] Yuki Ando After graduating from university, after working as a bank, he registered a tax accountant in 2008.

It is well-known for easy-to-understand explanations for beginners.
the white house, the impeachment of the impeachment, the big panic.
White House officials were excited to counter the new Democrats' impeachment pressure on Thursday, and detailed officials explained that there was no plan to deal with the newly emerging reality this week.
A person close to the White House said that the appeal of internal accusations on the atmosphere of the West Building seems to have been increasing in concern, anxiety, and anxiety about the possibility that the President and some peripherals inflict a significant damage.
He said, "I don't know what it is."
The White House officials joked that there was no obvious plan on this situation, and the possibility that the President could not apply the usual measures that had been successfully involved in the matter until now was very serious, so there was no doubt about how to proceed, "It seems that the news will be erased next."
Another person who is familiar with this controversy expressed the atmosphere of the White House, which is increasing the alert, as the president replied that the impeachment was prolonged, and the possibility of "unnecessarily" would increase.
Another concern is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is expected to be raised daily, and there are also close associates of the President who are expected to act "impulsive."
Trump's increasingly unpredictable behavior and concerns about the possibility of a violent attack on unexpected means, and is concerned about the President and politics in the environment of the election year.
Trump faced the greatest threat that he had never seen before in his term as president, and revived his strategy that he considered effective during the Russian investigation of Robert Morler, and changed his position as a defender.
Trump tried to lighten his request to the Ukrainian president who wanted to cooperate with the investigation of the political enemies, and was interested in the activities of the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden, and attempted to undermine the credibility of the internal accused as a motive for a party conflict.
However, many of the White House officials have endured the Morler investigation, but this time they began to feel the difference, and the close associates said.
Although he was a brand president, he seemed to be visiting at the press conference on Wednesday, and he said he was familiar with this situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but it was not a border to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the defendants have identified the fact that President Trump and Vorozimir Zellensky, who had not had direct information on the call with the President of Ukraine, have argued that it is a fact that undermines the credibility of the whistleblower and believe that damage can be reduced.
Furthermore, it is often happens when the President is attacked, but the momentum of the support layer increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic home close to the White House pointed out that the basic support rate of the president is already very high and the effects of impeachment on new supporters are not much.
In particular, if the impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the President for the next four months."
Another source of information was that those who claimed that impeachment could help the President were not fully aware of how the President's response would be.
Concerned White House officials seek advice to advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the bones of the plan, this initiative is still in the early stage, but it is still unclear what kind of action such as the strategic decision room will be implemented.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have a clear leader who can organize public relations in an aggressive manner to counter the momentum that the publication and release of critical internal charges against the Democratic impeachment.
For more information on this situation, the lack of long-term strategic viewpoints is clearly visible, such as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Finance Steven Munshins, who expressed that they would not publish notes on the call with the President of Ukraine of Trump 48 hours later.
According to the person involved in this case, the person who might be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitble of Trump and was the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwanduski told NBC news that it is not accurate that he would be the leader of such efforts.
"We've been doing everything we can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but we don't have to talk with the president or close associates about participating in a team that counters this false impeachment."
Trump's external lawyer Jay Scorp is also involved in impeachment efforts.
In response to NBC news coverage, Scorp said, "The problem is properly processed."
Emmet Fladd, who was involved in Clinton's impeachment and led the White House until the end of Moeller's investigation, had little experience with the current White House legal adviser Pat Ciporon, and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience of impeachment.
The details of the White House's strategy are generally far away from the establishment of human resources invitations and strategic teams, but they are aware that they need human resources to be organized and able to lead all of their efforts and political struggle.

Long distance love must be prepared Only 16% success rate Tomoyoshi Morikawa - Yahoo! News
9/6 (Fri) 13:51
I had a boyfriend, but because of his work, I had a long distance love ...
I said, "Let's get married someday," but I couldn't see the goal.
When that happens, how can we connect the situation with our allies to marriage?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa, a professor at Waseda University, explained the solution.
Prof. Morikawa's advice and must be read.
this is my concern.
I am worried that I should continue with my boyfriend in distant love.
I want to continue living in Kansai, where my workplace is also home, but my job is in Tokyo.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that "Let's get married in the future."
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office).
A couple who got married from a distant love
C is in love with a boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also a word that "the distance is tested and the two become stronger," but in the first place, distant love is going to work?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter Morikawa) The survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered, but according to the data, only 16% of couples who came from distant love to marriage.
Since love is done using five senses, it is originally a relationship with looking at the opponent (visual), listening to the voice (heart), holding hands (touching), smelling the smell (no smell), kissing.
However, in the case of distant love, there are cases where you can hear the voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep working with only hearing situations.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to your opponent's house, your body will be responsible for moving time and effort to heal your work fatigue.
When I return, I feel comfortable.
Is that the only way to get away?
Morikawa I think it will work if there are couples who can endure without frequent meetings or couples who are determined in advance for a distance.
If you're engaged one year later or you'll come back two years later.
It may be difficult if you don't see a future landing point.

devin Nunes, accused of the Democratic Party of Trump's Nude Photography.
Senator Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems to be unable to bear the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, he condemned the Democratic Party trying to get the President's nude photo in a comment to defend the president.
Members of the House Information Special Committee of the House of Representatives, Nunes, filed an appeal at the beginning of the hearing on internal charges that Trump requested to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The U.S. Congress condemned the Democratic Party to see the full naked picture of the President, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grostesque show" created by the left faction and its media assets.
"The Democratic Party of the Special Committee negotiated with the Ukrainians for the purpose of obtaining Trump's nude photos."
It is natural that everyone asks why the Democratic Party is so exciting to impeachment this president.
After the scolding of Nunes, a reporter at the senior political department of Jennifer Bendilly in Haf post decided to determine whether the Democratic Party would seek the truth.
The response was only to the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, but also to many other members, questioning whether the answer was a naked truth.
Medire dotcom speculates that Nunes's Noudist comments may be related to "more unidentified details" that were written in steel documents that were discussed.
It is a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, who collected shocking claims against Trump, in one of the rooms in Moscow, where Trump is said to be showing the urine of prostitutes and referring to the "Okko Tape."
Origami, wallet and real card.
Money from Yahoo!
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to transfer money (moving) through collaboration with remittances and financial institutions accounts in addition to payment by Origin Pay.
It also features a charge.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origin Wallet.
"We will create new financial services to solve the problem of the younger generation who must live in a variety of problems with money, such as pensions and low interest rates," said Miyuki Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services.
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origin ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get information in time.
In addition to the Origami app, he explained that it is possible to deploy it on a partner's app.

He was awarded the first class of Korea's Friendship Medal by the Honorary Chairman of the Japan-Korea Music and Arts Exchange Association, and on September 7, a meeting was held in Awena Osaka, Osaka, Osaka City, to commemorate the singer Mitoko Ogasawara, who died at the age of 100.
the people involved showed the representative songs of Ogasawara.
There were about 140 people from Japan, including Mr. Yunaga, Chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, and Mr. Yukie Ikebe, Chairman of the Japan-Korea Music Exchange Association.
In the ceremony, Mr. Yukie IKEBE greeted me.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I still can't believe that the teacher died," while preparing for "Remembers," he felt that Miko Ogasawara was a great and great person."
On the other hand, he said, "If you can do activities that can expand the meeting even a little," he said.
After being devoted to silence, Messse-ji, who was sent by the Korean Art Exchange Association of Korea and the director of the International Institute of Chuchu thought, was introduced.
in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks and semis have monopolized the news, it is only flying in the sky, and it is said that renewable energy is not available.
However, the University of Alberta has developed a technology to enable renewable biofuels as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, professor at the Department of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, started the project in 2003.
The professor's laboratory has developed hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as oil fat, livestock rendering, and canopy oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use low-quality fats for production, and carbon emissions are less than 85% lower than crude oil-based fuels.
This technology also acts as a reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude fuel.
Dr. Bresler said, "This technology achieved in the first generation is the hydrocarbon of molecules in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems to move high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma," Dr. Bresler said.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options as a biofuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try it in a reactor to change the chemical reaction slightly."
This option is risky.
As airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army have increased their investment in renewable options, Fortune Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They are expecting someone to impose carbon tax in the future."
I would like to prepare an alternative to the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near Edmonton's Waste Management Center, and recently invested US$4 million from Lockheed Martin to build a production facility of $22 million in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 1900 million litter biofuels annually.
Dr. Bressler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but there is no reduction in fuel transport and production.
"As a technical store," says Bresler.
My job is to create an option to make multiple choices in parallel with the decisions I have explained.

Boris Johnson warns that if Brexit is over, Britain faces riots like Los Angeles, and the Prime Minister calls for calmness.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a danger that "a fierce riot by the people" would occur in this country.
The Prime Minister's officials warned that Britain would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that it was necessary to "teach anger" against political words that had been exchanged with intense speech, but insisted that the word "default" would not be used.
Despite the appeal of the Prime Minister to regain his calmness, one Cabinet said to the Times: "In this country, there was no such thing as the Yellowest Movement or the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country just because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best movement -- they're encrypting mobile phones and organizing demonstrations, and then there's a few populists who use dirty hands to drive people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when four white policemen who were beaten by black taxi driver Rodney King told the jury guilty.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstration participant Zile Joan, who wore the yellow best, has caused confusion and destruction in Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed to Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives, stating that if Britain failed to withdraw from the EU, the credibility of Japan's political system would be devastating.
"If 30 million people voted for a referendum and 66% voted to remain in the EU, the 100 million people are dissatisfied."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It is not so long until tens of thousands of people go through the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum would cover the first outcome, there would be a danger that "strong riots by the people" would occur in this country.
Johnson calls for the general election to leave Breguet's decision to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a rebellion in the House of Representatives seeking to lower the demands for the withdrawal of the EU and instead beat the EU in a compromise.

Pakistani social media celebrity brother, honor murder, life sentence
Many women's rights experts say that the procedure is long and it takes time to execute the sentence.
"It's time-consuming, so people forget" women's rights activist Farzana Bali, the founder of the first gender department at the University of Pakistan, added that even the Burrought incident, which has attracted attention, took more than three years to resolve.
Human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "religious murders" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say that the number of real honorable homicides is much more than that, but it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorable homicides that occur every year in the world are occupied by Pakistan.
Countermeasures for pork cholera 1.3 billion yen to add to Shizuoka Prefecture and the September correction plan (Oritsune Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
It was reported on the 26th Congress Committee that it would add a total of 1400 million yen to the supplementary budget plan for September, with a budget of $13,600 million, and a decision-making cost required for the acquisition of land on the elevated JRnuma Station.
It is proposed to the prefectural assembly on 27th.
As a result, the total amount of public accounting for the supplementary budget for September was 81.8 million yen.
As a result of the new pig cholera outbreak in Saitama Prefecture, the prefecture has expanded the disinfection point of livestock transport vehicles that are currently located in Lake West to three locations in Gotenba City, Fujinomiya City, and Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City.
As a result, it is estimated to be 740 million yen.
Furthermore, in order to prevent the spread of infection from wild boars, which are the main infectious pathways, we will begin measures to ensure that wild boars are captured and not infected by pig cholera in other areas other than the western part of the prefecture.
The cost of capturing and inspecting 1560 heads in eastern and central prefectures is 58.6 million yen.
In the case of a decision-making procedure related to the enhancement of the Numazu Station, the cost of outsourcing the evaluation of the expected site and the operating expenses associated with the holding of the Subcommittee Committee are added.

Floods and chaos caused by monsoons in many areas
The Monsoon season in India is about a month long, with unprecedented rainfall, buildings collapsed and many of the crops began to rot.
Monsoons in northern India are usually weak in early September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, Monsoon will be weakened in the late decades.
In many areas of India, there were still unprecedented rains, and the latest news is that in the western part of India, the buildings collapsed due to heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
The house was flooded, and the residents took the water to the knees to cross the street, usually seen at the peak of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Lakau, and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rain.
In the northern part of Utttarkand, it suffered heavy damage to houses due to heavy rain.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
Water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for the possibility of drought.
The long-standing Monsoon for farmers is not desirable.
At this time, the rainfall is not normal.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Vimtal, Uttarcando, said, "We are making cabbage, beans, peas, tomatoes, but vegetables are rotting in rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the influence of Monsoon, which is not weak in power.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, onions of 20 rupees (23 pens) are usually sold at 80 rupees (about 1 pound).
The festival is also under threat.
The next big festival is Dašera on October 8, and the Hindus set up Ravana, a man of evil smiles to be worn by a huge comic book-style doll, epic poem "Lamaryana."
The burning of Ravana means that good destroyed evil.
However, since the dolls are made of paper, if the Monsoon pulls long, then the last laugh may be Ravana.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack.
The latest research shows that working around pesticides in high concentrations may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to a group of men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"It is important to note that when exposed to pesticides in work, it is important to wear personal protective gears, describe the presence of pesticide exposure in work, and to reduce the standard risk factors of heart disease," says Dr. Beatrice Rodrigues, co-author of the study.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This was the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men in Oahu, who participated in the Kakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this study may not be applied to women or other races because it is only targeting Japanese Americans.
Since pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
This study showed the greatest impact within 10 years after exposure.
"As a result of a 34-year tracking survey, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said.
This is probably because the importance of other factors related to aging is increasing, and it hides possible relationships between pesticides and mental disorders in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Zellensky: Poloshenko intervention at the Trump phone meeting
The impeachment procedure for President Donald Trump was made, and the Washington political issue was a radical week.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners Vladimir Zellensky.
However, what has happened to the Zellensky Trump phone problem so far?
At the beginning of the telephone meeting, Trump told Zellensky that the U.S. is more convenient than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not repeated, it has been described in detail that Trump criticized the fact that Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders were focusing on a more specific proposal.
Zellensky's response to Trump's claim of 100% rather than 1000 percent is disputed.
Zellensky added that both French President and Merkel did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties disputed social media.
President Petro Poloschenko wrote on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance from the EU."
In addition, Poloschenko tweeted that he was grateful to support the EU's sanctions and economic assistance during the Russian invasion.
The Ukrainian politician, Victoria Voivoticus, also referred to as "Is it possible to negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Following Trump's request for military assistance, instead of one, to ask Zellensky for two investigations, the first is to suggest that Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is the investigation of the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic E-mail fraud during the 2016 elections.
It is uncertain whether this would interfere with European relations or lay a backwater line against the French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
With the announcement of the call, I would like to thank those who supported it."
Zellensky will meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the Nordic 4 Summit scheduled in October.
He won two awards in Ghana and the International Civil Aviation Organization.
At the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Meeting in Montreal, Canada, Ghana won two prestigious awards.
This safety award was awarded by Ghana to an interim 89.89% of its effective implementation rate and to the highest score in Africa by air safety supervision.
Prior to this, ICAO completed the coordination verification survey (ICVM) on April 3, 2019.
The safety award was approved by Ghana to comply with ICAO's recommendations on the safety of the airport and its own air.
These awards were created as part of the support of the ICAO Zero Campaign.
In addition, 16 certifications and 17 certifications were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The award was received by Joseph Cofi Ada Ghana, Minister of Aviation, Simon Aloty Ghana, Ambassador Nii Aico Otou to Canada, and Director of the Yau Kuwakwa Ghana Airport Company.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the International Civil Aviation Organization of Ormiwa Benard Aliu stressed the need to maintain aviation safety in the participating countries in the speech.
"It is important to continue to realize that aviation safety and security and sustainability are still the most fundamental priorities in the era of innovation."
He also said that the award was a gift of Ghana's efforts to complement the efforts and patience of the sector.
He further pointed out that the aviation industry has a great potential to dramatically change our lives.
There are social economic benefits, but all of them are safe and secure that we have achieved.

CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down the illegal marijuana baying business in San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (BSLA) - Police closed the illegal marijuana baying activity in San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After police conducted a search warrant at 4:37 p.m. on suspicion of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of botan honey oil (rich cannabis oil) was found in office buildings located on the 9600 block of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators found equipment packed with bayp cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
In the process of extracting oil used for Bayp products, Captain Cano said that he had previously been engaged in drug investigation and that it could be a fire.
"The static electricity from clothes can only be ignited, and because it is concentrated, it will cause fire as well as explosions."
In addition, if there were multiple containers, it could not only explode one after another, but also burn the entire building.
The risk management team was summoned to an empty office to seize illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of confiscated goods and equipment were not immediately announced.
He received an anonymous information and told the investigators that it led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigator is still in pursuit of who is the black curtain of illegal Bayp activities.
The police said that the office was empty, so Zhang himself thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police said that, especially in recent news related to the dangers of batting, would like to tend to be illegal sleeping products and not go out.
Captain Cano said, "It's really a real thing or something you're buying without knowing."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have a great impact on our community and children, so police always warn people not to approach these activities.

Exhibitions at Hampton Court Palace, the lost dress of Elizabeth I.
It was woven with silver foil threads made of the finest camlet silk, and a gorgeous embroidery of plants, beasts and butterflies was made.
Herstic Royal Palace dress collection curator, Eli Lin, is one of them.
This fallen piece of cloth, which was hung on the wall of a small church in one country, was placed there 100 years ago, and was considered part of the clothing lost from Elizabeth I's clothing dance.
Three years after Lin accidentally found this luxurious cloth, which was used as the altarpiece of the church in Bactton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited in the Hampton Court Palace next month, near exactly that room where the Queen of Tudor could wear over 450 years ago.
Other than the rest of the 16th century dress, it is found that the entire Royal dress collection was an important discovery.
Although Elizabeth had no perfect evidence of the dress through the sleeves, he was convinced that the dress had not been a part of the royal possession for three years.
The most expensive textiles, "the cloth with silver thread," were prepared by law only among the senior members of the Royal Family, but they also suggested that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later was noble.
At the time the dress was built, it seems that it was equivalent to one house in the Tudor style.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen was increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rival wearing such luxurious clothing had not endured.
Mr. Lin said that it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues.
When I looked at the cloth, I was always happy to hear that it was amazing, and I was convinced that I was watching one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of a dress used as an altarpiece of the Holy Face Church of Bakton, cut off and unmarked, is not as unexpected.
Baxton is a village from Brunswick Parley, who served as a female officer throughout the long life of Queen Elizabeth, and is said to have long been associated with Parley.
The dress is after Paley's death in 1590, but experts believe that before Elizabeth died in 1603, it must have been presented to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
Over 1000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours were specially dyed silk and a very delicate hand stitched altar cloth will be exhibited next to Elizabeth, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The vast space as much as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries was only a renovated greenhouse on the Hampton Court grounds, and the preservation work was done almost here.
Looking at the embroidered embroidered on the front and back, I feel very much respect for those who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held from October 12 at Hampton Court Palace.
"The scope of the request has been searched and found" A week after the missing girl, the Self-Defense Force withdrew and the volunteer men are missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It is a week after the first year of elementary school girls are missing in the campground in Yamanashi Prefecture.
The Self-Defense Force, which had no clues yet, closed the search and withdrew on 28th.
The search for Ogura Misaki, a first-year student in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, began at 6:00 a.m. with about 240 police and SDF personnel.
However, the village requested to withdraw from the Self-Defense Forces as "the scope of the request was searched."
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Force sent 650 people, mainly on the mountain slopes and the dangerous places such as Sawa.
On the 27th, there was no way to find a 20-year-old man who participated in a search by volunteers.
Police and firefighters continue to search from 6:30 am on 29th.
The first oral dialect, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral statement of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, where voters sought to invalidate the election in July this year.
As a result of the appeal, the plaintiffs appealed to the election invalidity, with the value of one vote in Miyazaki Prefecture and only 0.48 votes in Kagoshima Prefecture, compared to the number of voters per member of Fukui Prefecture in July this year.
The first oral statement of the 27th day at the Fukuoka High Court Miyazaki branch claimed that "the value of one vote was inequality and wrong."
On the other hand, the prefectural election manager on the Defendant side asked for a rejection of the claim, "It should not be said that there was a significant inequalities about the issue of constitutionality.
The judgment is passed on 30 October.

a third of the drug in the united states
Shortly after the sunrise of Chicago Westside, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Administration (DEA) revealed what was going on in the white daytime.
Nearly 800 people died in Chicago last year in excess of drugs.
McNight said that 90 percent of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug king named El Mencho Nemecio Selvantes.
"Mencho is the first person to ask for DEA and the top priority of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency in the United States."
El Mencho's winnings reach $1 million.
With the help of Donahhe, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were violent.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisko Nueva, is involved in at least one third of the drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, Cartel sold "a large amount of cocaine, methane phenyl mixed heroin."
El Mencho's neck is worth $1,000.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested and deported to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartel.
He owns a large amount of weapons, a crewed rocket, and a 50-calimeter bullet.
In fact, his own special maneuvers were also owned by Donahhe.
From the death of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, there have been thousands of murders caused by the fight against drug cartels.
According to the statistics of the Mexican government, about 94 murders occurred a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic, so it is necessary to wear protective clothes when handling.
At the manufacturing center, the seal of the smuggler is pressed in the bag of cocaine.
More than one third of the drug was made by El Mencho.
Donahhe said, "Mencho is involved in the influx of harmful substances that effectively capture the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone died, Donahhe said that it was "probably" a drug that was brought from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died last year.

Teno-ji Zoo (Teno-ji Ward, Osaka City) opened on 28th, a farewell party for the only male to be bred in Osaka Prefecture.
A 10-year loan to the British zoo was decided in mid-October for breeding, and it is likely not to return.
thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of the core building, which was rich in eucalyptus.
He is 12 years old.
It is believed that the life of Corera's breeding was 15 to 20 years, and Tenju was born in the United Kingdom, where he was married.
Mr. Eiki Tsujimoto (40) in charge said, "It's hard to put down the curtain on the breeding of the corela, and it's filled with gratitude."
Sony, Playstation 4 surprise news, PS4 game, was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the contents of the Last of Part 2.
As part of the recent state-of-play announcement, Sony announced the release of the sequel to Last of As in February 2020.
A part of the video of this new action game was also presented to fans.
A few days after the Last of As2 news, more details were announced.
Sony and Noty Dog seem to return to the wind in various ways.
Since the time of PSwan, the last of the two parts have been released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Notydog Neil Drackman announced that the sequel evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"The story is magnificent and complex in a different sense than the previous work," he said.
And it was necessary to tell stories that had so many characters.
He didn't intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolds, and the user felt that this was the end, but in fact it was beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game did not enter a single blue ray, but it was two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 includes one or two bad Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are open at work.
Although it does not ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs in the game contain nostalgic Noty Dog works.
If the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 limited to PS4, you will know more.
Those who have PS4 should pick up the last of as well as prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently announced a free PS4 game for PlayStation Plus, including the aforementioned Noty Dogs.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like Last of the Remastered and want to reserve the sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie backpack and bracelet replica, a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Local residents hope to continue (Kitakuni Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 26th day of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased due to an aging population, the Notoshima Regional Development Council, which was established by residents, began to sell.
During the trial until December, wagons with daily supplies, seasonings, and food ran over Susomachikai and Hanura-chokai on the first day.
There were also products that had been sold more than expected, and the residents asked for a continuation that they would "help."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
The total vegetables, such as potato salads, which are divided into packs, are lined up at an affordable price of 100 yen.
At the Suso-chokai, a group of residents was formed, and salt and sugar were sold out.
"I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping at his husband's driving, said, "I don't know when my father can drive, but I want to continue."
The user also received orders such as "I want you to put coffee on your own, not canned coffee."
The Council considers the products that were requested.
At Noto Island, there are only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell the goods to save "shop weak."
By December, the 20-machi-kai in the island will be around once a month and will be considered to continue as a business after the next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that it had decided to add about $1 billion to those affected by drought.
Cash support policies for farmers affected by droughts have been extended, and existing farmers' allowances are significantly reviewed for simplicity.
In addition, approximately 34,000 million dollars will be allocated to the Disaster Relief Agency and the target farmers will receive an emergency assistance of up to 30,000 dollars.
As a subsidy program for drought-related areas, each of the 13 municipalities has a maximum of $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought damage.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded more than $70 billion as a drought support.
Ronald Lee Haskel: A former wife's family murder in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskel (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014, killing four of Steven and Katie St., and five children.
On July 9, 2014, the authorities said that he was forced into the residence of Stay and asked where his wife, Melanie Haskel, was located.
Melanie was absent, but his sister, Katie St., and his family.
Huskel fired, and the Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katty Stay (33), 13-year-old and four-year-old son, nine- and seven-year-old daughter, died.
In his family, only one person, Cashy Stay, was 15 years old at that time.
At the time, the authorities reported that Kashmiri was seriously injured, but it recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed the innocence of Ronald Lee Haskel's heart loss.
The jury was dismissed until the day of the month.
"If you choose to disappointed us, you will never forgive us."
I wonder if the girl's appeal to the anger was echoed by the leaders of each country.
Global warming is becoming more serious.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City, a 16-year-old environmental activist, Greta Thunberg, spoke about strengthening measures.
He became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world, including boycotting classes and sitting in front of Congress.
The young people who raised anxiety and frustration were protesting all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people from over 150 countries participated.
In Morioka, he marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, which started in 2020, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the world to virtually zero in the second half of the century, and to reduce the temperature rise to less than twice before the Industrial Revolution.
All participating countries, regardless of the distinction between developed countries and developing countries, take measures to be implemented.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to the relationship with global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, is followed in various places.
In order to increase global warming at a fast pace, we need to strengthen our efforts.
At the summit held by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal to virtually zero by 50.
Other 70 countries raised their target for the immediate future.
On the other hand, in addition to the U.S., which expressed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not express their new goals, and the slowness of the movement of the emission powers became apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
In the government's long-term strategy, as early as possible in the latter half of the century, the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's efforts at the environmental-related meeting, said that he should work on fun, cool and sexy at a meeting on climate change issues.
The appeal is not denied, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
It is now a symbol of environmental movement.
The injury that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "Replacement of Issues" that the person opposes.
There is no longer a blessing to combat global warming, and the international community must respond to a common crisis in humanity.
There is no need to be enough effective for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
If you don't take that future, you should act as an adult.
one step further to realize quantum internet -- Science Daily
The results of the U.S. Army's research led to the realization of the quantum Internet.
Such Internet may be able to secure military safety, measure and measure time functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the United States Army Research Institute's Distributed Quantum Information Center, which is funded by the U.S. Army Research Institute, researchers at Insbruck University achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between materials and light - 50 km from optical fiber cables.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangling state and one is measured, even if the other quantum bits are physically distant, the measurement results are affected.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building a intercity quantum network," says Dr. Ben Lañon, the leading researcher of the project, who published results in Nature's quantum information.
It is said that the intercity quantum network consists of a network of physical quantum bits in Entangle, despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entangling is absolutely essential for the establishment of the quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize large-scale decentralized engagement," says Dr. Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at the exit through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser rays to write quantum states on ions, and then excited until quantum information was released.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangled.
The challenge is to send photons to optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of the photon emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and it is absorbed immediately into the optical fiber cable," says Dr. Lañon.
In his team, he first sent light particles through nonlinear crystals with strong lasers.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, which is the standard wavelength of current distance communication.
The photon was then sent through a fiber optic cable 50 kilometers long.
Despite the conversion of wavelengths, atoms and light particles remained entangled.
"The use of calcium atoms can capture calcium at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangled network in long-distance atomic clocks.
The large Entangle watch network is a very important field for the Army from the perspective of accurate positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications."
