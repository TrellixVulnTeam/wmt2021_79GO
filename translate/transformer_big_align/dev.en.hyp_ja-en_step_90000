Croatia's nuclear treatment facility plan, Bosnian people protest
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia and protested the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from its only nuclear power plant near the river known for its beautiful nature near the border with Bosnia.
The demonstration participants gathered in the town of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly urged Croatia to abandon plans to store the site of the barracks in Turkovska Gola, and pledge to fight the plan.
The facility will store waste from the nuclear power plant.
The Bosnian people, who wrote, "Don't take a healthy future," "We need to stop it."
We must oppose it.
The mayor of Novi Grad, Miloslav Dryaka, said to the crowd.
We must fight to protect our lives and the Una River.
The Kursko nuclear power plant, which started operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned by Croatia.
Government officials from both countries will discuss next week and discuss the expansion of waste disposal facilities.
The Croatian national broadcaster reported on Friday that Croatia should build its own storage facility or that Slovenia would not yet decide whether to pay for the cost of waste in Croatia, which would be handled by newly constructed facilities.
The Croatian Minister of Environment and Energy, Tomilab Chorich, told the announcer that Croatia had problems in the disposal of public waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and wanted to find a complete solution.
In Bosnia, all ethnic activists, officials and residents in the country claimed Croatia to seek another construction site on its own side near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would the Bosnian pants pocket, that is, the Turkovska gola, be the best place in Croatia?"

So what is the sign of Münchhausen syndrome?
The symptoms of the disease vary in case-by-case, but NHS is listed as the following precautions.
The child is likely to be healthy, but if the condition is poor, the medical practitioner will try to calm down.
It can be described as rough or false.

Nigeria: police force investigation into the school of Cadona, rescue 300 children
The Kaduna Police arrested seven teachers and rescued about 300 children yesterday.
The police said that children were placed in a humanitarian environment, but the school denied this claim.
The residents of the school, named Chef, said, "The children are in school with parents' consent, so their claims are not true."
"Before entering school, parents signed their consent.
Parents have come to deliver their children's meals every day, so they know what kind of environment they are.
It was very surprising that the police came and evacuated the children, and all the food delivered by their parents left, and the school closed.
There are parents who can test whether the police had children in such a terrible environment, but this is an unfair treatment."
He added that the former police headquarters Abdullahman had visited once to confirm what kind of environment the children were doing, but he did not say any complaints.
The children also learn Corran and say that it is all.
However, police spokesman Yakub Savo said that children would be reunited after they were handed over to the state government.
"Instead of obtaining knowledge about Corran, they were placed in a humanitarian environment.
Many children were injured in their back.
Therefore, we are investigating the school to know the owner of the facility."

Pope, AI development is based on public interests and warns IT companies.
Pope Francis warned IT representatives, diplomats, investors, etc. that if there was no moral assessment of public interests, artificial intelligence development competition and other digital development would increase social injustice.
The Pope said at the Vatican Conference where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethical scholars met.
At the meeting, a few scholars and Catholic bishops were invited.
The three-day meeting was the latest evidence of the Vatican's willingness to participate in discussions on future and dangers in artificial intelligence development.
At the meeting, discussions on the future of war technology and increasing machine work were held, and at the same time, examples of gunfire incidents in Christchurch in New Zealand and the responses of social media companies during the atrocities were examined.
In his speech at the meeting, Pope commended the development of technological progress, citing how machines were released from dangerous and simple labor in the opening of the Industrial Revolution.
However, if you rely on robotics to pursue profits, you may be afraid to take away the dignity of labor from humans.
"If technological advances cause increasingly pronounced inequality, it is not true progress," the Pope warned.
If human so-called technological advances are hostile to public interests, then unfortunately, we will be going back to a state of barbarism based on the theory of Qiang people.
According to the organizers of the conference, the participants will take advantage of their expertise in the meeting to find people who can become a future advisor to the Catholic Church in the high-tech field.

Real Madrid's loan, player Martin Woodegor, and fan excitement with voice assist.
Martin Woodegor gave a surprise support to Michel Oyalusabar.
Real Madrid won the Ossana at 2-0, renewing the undefeated record in the current domestic season, leading to La Liga rankings.
However, despite not losing one game in La Liga this season, Zinedine Zidan has been exposed to a tremendous pressure, such as a fierce open battle and a public discontent with the Welsh star Gales Bayer.
When Real Madrid was humiliated by the Paris Sangelman (PSG) in the Champonnes League, the pressure seems to have reached the limit of patience.
However, the director and Real Madrid seem to have a real talent, and there are players who are not in the current plan of the director.
Vinicius Juniall is one of the stars that took place in the future of Real Madrid and currently plays in the team.
However, while renting to Real Socieda, another young Norwegian Martin Wooddegor also provided an exquisite assist in La Liga.
Martin Woodegor played against Real Socienda against Arabeth, and was surprised by Michel Oyalusaval's preemption, and Real Socieda won his home base in 3-0.
Martin Woodegor, who received the ball from the right, sent an exquisite pass through the inside of the other two players to Oyalusabar to determine the goal by taking this completely accurate through ball.
With the second goal of Willian Jose and the third penalty spot of the stunning Oyalusabar, Albeth's Midfiller Manu Garcia secured the overwhelming victory of the Imanor team just before the end of 5 minutes.
Martin Woodegor joined Real Madrid at the age of 16 in 2015, but suffered four hardships to demonstrate his reputation.
This Norwegian youth, who was 20 years old, seems to have finally demonstrated this territory.
Anna Hazale, and Sharad Powerle were surprised by the fraud of the Maharashtra cooperative bank.
Anna Hazale said, "When I contacted this lawsuit, the name of Sharad Powerle was not listed."
Social activist Anna Hazale was surprised by the sudden rise of the name of the leader of the National Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Powerle in the Maharashtra cooperative bank fraud incident involving thousands of rupees.
In connection with the fraud incident, the Executive Bureau of the Investigation Agency (ED) filed a financial cleaning lawsuit against Sharad Powerll and his nephew, Deputy Minister of State Maharashtra.
Based on the Financial Cleaning Act, an executive report comparable to the first report of the police was registered by the Central Authority.
The lawsuit is based on the first report of the Mumbai Police, accused of the name of the former chairman of the bank, Amit Powerll and the former staff of the union bank of 70.
When he came to contact the lawsuit, his name was nowhere.
Anna Hazale said on Thursday that Anna Hazale only knows how the name of Sharad emerged and who mentioned it.
Anna Hazale, critic of Sharad Powerll, expressed his expectation that if the Executive Bureau conducted detailed investigations into the fraud, the truth would be revealed.
Anna Hazale, a veteran of many anti-corruption activities, said, "The Executive Bureau will know how his name emerged in this case."
Sharad Powerle denied any fraud and claimed that there was no relationship with the co-bank, and questioned the timing of the lawsuit registration just a few weeks before the election of Maharashtra on October 21.
The former Prime Minister clearly pointed to the government led by the Indian People's Party and refused to surrender before Delhi's "Lord."
The NCP referred to a lawsuit by the Executive Bureau as a political abbreviation.

Stop the accident!
Four of the following: Yahoo! News
you can buy it at a reasonable price.
A traffic accident caused by a driver's mistake.
In particular, an increase in the number of accidents caused by the failure of the brake and accelerator by the elderly driver is on the rise.
In particular, when you start a sudden, you will be panicked, and you will be on the brake pedal.
There is a new car equipped with a safety driver support feature that covers such a driver's mistake, but there is also a rearing device that can be attached to the unmounted car.
After-sale parts manufacturers are developing and selling emergency prevention and prevention systems.
I would like to introduce what features each have.
The pedal interval between the accelerator and the brake is narrow, and at the same time it passes.
[e-ACCEL ALRM] To inform you of the pedal mistake from a new perspective, "e-ACCEL ALRM" developed by Pivot.
The pedal's step mistake is to avoid using the alarm sound.
The mechanism occurs " alarm sound" when you step on the accelerator pedal by mistake when you stop or slow driving.
By reacting to the sound and encouraging the accelerator to return, and quickly recognizing the step mistake, it avoids rapid acceleration.
It is difficult to understand the changes in engine sound due to the step-by-step error of the accelerator, and it is also effective for elderly drivers who are prone to hearing.
It is attached to the OBDII connector, and the main body is attached with a double-sided tape.
The price is 9800 yen (excluding tax) and it is easy to set.
The world wing was launched in mid-September, but the accelerator brake step prevention device "Do you watch as Ashi."
It is also possible to reverse (back) without advance.
At the time of stop (and less than 10Km/h), when the accelerator pedal is stepping into a rapid pace, the vehicle's speed signal and brake signal are detected, and electrically suppresses the accelerator opening and suppresses the rapid advance.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, don't tell the signal from the accelerator, and instantly control the advance by turning it into the creeping state (where the brake is separated by the D range).
At the back of the vehicle, there is also a function to detect the speed of about 5Km/h and force the vehicle to switch to creep.
The mounting can only be done with capulon and simple wiring processing.
The price is 37,000 yen (excluding tax).

"If there is a child who can't stay still, I'd like to use my mind around him."
The woman (45) in the center of Saga City, with five children from 4 to 12 years old, was soaked in water around the house.
"I can't run away with five people," he says, "I'm going to spend my time at home as much as possible during the disaster, and I have food and simple toilet.
"There is no correct answer for the preparation, and the need for the family configuration and housing situation will change."
Shinko Kawasaki (40) of Shiraishi-cho, with a 6-year-old and 8-year-old child, proposed that " elementary school had an e-mail for a rest school on the day before, but the nursery does not have a communication network or a mail system."
There was also a request to build a system that could share flooded roads in real time.
Mr. Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed in the past, and I don't understand that it was okay last time.I want to take care of small ingenuity and connections with people and prepare for disasters."
TANAKA said, "I think the opinions issued will be conveyed to the government as a group."
The relationship between Boris Johnson and the female businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri and the police agency inquiries.
The Police Agency (IOPC) will examine whether the scandal in London's mayor's office should be investigated as a violation of the criminal code.
The Government of London (GLA) announced that GLA's supervisors had recorded the prime minister's "acts on acts" on suspicion that Archici had received preferential treatment from the friendly relations with the Prime Minister.
"There is information that indicates the possibility of a crime," says GLA.
This never proved.
IOPC will consider whether it is necessary to investigate this matter.
The problem was entrusted to IOPC, but IOPC is an agency that corresponds to charges issued by the police in England and Wales.
The problem was entrusted to the police authorities because Johnson was at the time in a position comparable to the police chief.
Johnson denied fraud related to his friendship.
Prior to this, Johnson stated that he would follow the London Parliament's order to provide detailed information about his relationship with the Archici.
The announcement was reported by the Sunday Times, but it was reported that Johnson was paid £126,000 from public money during the London mayor's reign seven years ago by the Americans who moved to London, and he was given a preferential treatment to join the foreign trade delegation with Johnson.
Since then, the government has frozen 100,000 pounds of subsidies to the hacker house, a company of Mr. Curi during the investigation.
The company will ask questions about the survey process conducted before the subsidy is paid.
Mr. Matt Waman, Minister of Digital Affairs, said in the House of Representatives that the Digital Department has "normally appropriate evaluation" and that the company owns the British phone number.
However, according to many reports, the telephone number was transferred to the California office, where Mr. Curi (34) is now based.
The relationship between the Prime Minister and the female businessmen was "public secret among the staff."
The movement of GLA, which attempts to entrust the Prime Minister to the police agency, touched the anger of the Prime Minister's residence.
The government officials say that this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the Conservative Party's previous night was "too party-oriented."
"There was no evidence for any charges, and the Prime Minister was given the opportunity to answer the supervisory authority before the news announcement that was issued late on Friday night."
The people and the mass media will find out the political kyogen that was carefully organized.
As I mentioned earlier, the Standard Newspaper heard that Johnson, who supported the London Tourism Promotion Division, and his friendship with California businessman, were "public secrets."
The former staff of London and Partners (L&P) said that despite the fact that there were people who believed that the company was "untrustful" at that time, he had the privilege to accompany the trade-related talks abroad led by Johnson in the mayor's era.
A safe fund for ordinary living people to use to form property!
Morning Star - Yahoo! News
I heard about the future prospects of Mr. Ryu Sawakami, President and CEO of Iwakami Susumnobu.
"Sawakami Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary this August.
What are you feeling now?
First of all, there were many thoughts and efforts in the history of 20 years.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to all concerned people, not just the history of the "Sawakami Fund."
Originally, the idea of supporting the formation of property of ordinary living people is "Sawakami Fund."
This spirit has remained unchanged and has been pursued for 20 years.
If the general public eliminates the anxiety of money, the world will be brighter from the foundation.
In the long term, operations are not graded if they do not work together with beneficiaries.
Many money comes from the "Sawakami Fund" when the market plunges like the Lehman shock and the IT bubble burst.
"We will support companies that are needed in the world since this time," I feel that we have understood the message that we have been talking about since that time.
The result is a 20-year long-term long-term fund, and we believe it is because we continue to be a direct sales system to deliver messages directly to many people.
The report at the end of each month disclosed all investment companies, money and costs.
Generally speaking, the information about what you buy now is black box, but the "Sawakami Fund" has been disclosed.

mc miller's death, the third drug arrester, the key.
Los Angeles (AP) - Last year, rapper Mac Miller was arrested and charged with drug offenses associated with the death of drug overdose.
According to the trial record, Steven Walter was charged with selling counterfeit pills of oxykodon mixed with Fentanyl before Miller accidentally took over cocaine, alcohol and Fentanyl, but Fentanyl is a powerful opioid drug that has become a problem with the spread of thousands of deaths in the United States.
Walter is accused of providing drugs to Cameron Pett, another person who sold drugs to Miller.
According to a court record published on Tuesday, Pettyt had obtained drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Libis, arrested early this week in Lake Habas City, Arizona, was asked to pay Pett as Walter's "deliver."
All three are not directly charged with Miller's death, and are still in charge of individual cases.
Walter, currently in custody, was under probation in the 2005 drug case, and he was sentenced to five months in prison in violation of his compliance.
On Thursday, the first public prosecutors in charge of the case reported by the celebrity site TZ requested that Walter be detained until the trial start due to the high possibility of escaping abroad.
There was no immediate reply to a lawyer's call message.
Pettyt was prosecuted by the Federal Court on September 4, but the defender refused to comment.
Miller's lyrics include a frank word about depression and drug use, and the hip hop world also gained fans as one of the Great Palaces.
Miller from Pittsburgh, his real name, Malcolm James Myers McCormick, was a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, but was defeated in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of his own Instagram-loved mirror, and released a song titled "Sancue Neckst."
Miller is also one of the musicians who died recently associated with opioid drug abuse.
The rock band Three Doors Down guitarist Matthew Roberts died due to excessive intake of drugs in 2016, and Fenthanyl and Hydrocodon were detected in the body.
This article corrected the spelling of Walter's name by Stephen instead of Steven.
Development of over 30 mobile games in Nigeria
This 9-year-old boy uses a free programming app called scratch2 to create a game of hide.
Scratch 2 can be used to produce games, animations and stories on and offline.
Basil has used this app to create more than 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
Players get points when they catch bats that come out of hiding places.
He learned how to make games in short-term intensive courses.
Basil told CNN that he spends time making games when bored.
In March, his father applied for a five-day short-term intensive course for children aged 5-15.
This course, hosted by Code Fest International, was introduced to children like Basil to give them opportunities to touch new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
According to his father, Basil Okpara Senior, Basil grew up playing in many mobile games.
"Since Basil always had a mobile phone, he bought a tablet at the age of four.
Candy Crash and Temple Run did quite well," his father told CNN.
However, he was scolded by the fact that he was only playing games, and at the age of seven he was interested in making the game.
"One day I was wearing a tablet as usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, so I got a little angry."
He said, "I'm always playing games, but how do I make my own games so that others can play?"
When he said, he was angry and I didn't think Basil would care about it."
Since then, Basil, who has been interested in learning how to make his own game, asked his parents to buy a laptop and enrolled in a course to learn the first step of the game production.
Basil-chan, who wants to become a scientist in the future, has a name in his game.
One of the games, "Moskyt mash," can be purchased at Google Play Store.
The young population of Africa is the highest in the world, and if African innovation is made, the younger generation such as Basil will take the initiative.
Recently, Nigeria's 12-year-old two-year-olds used program code to create a robot that divides housework.
In May 2019, a women's high school team from Ghana who programmed a boxed robot won the Robofest contest.
Google and Microsoft giant technology companies are investing in Africa, and Basil-chan and the children of the same age are trying to become future programming stars.
former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, a false proof of bribery investigation
According to a court document submitted on Friday, it is expected that former North Carolina Republican chairman falsely claimed federal investigators who conducted corruption investigations involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court's case list, Robin Hayes will be convicted on Wednesday next week.
According to a document based on the fact that Hayes was prepared as part of the judiciary deal and signed by Hayes, Hayes was aware of the false statement of FBI agents in the 2018 bribery investigation.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the documents based on the facts are not specified in which sin is accepted by Hayes.
Hayes was initially accused of conspiracy, bribery, and false statements.
In return of special treatment, the prosecutor accused Hayes of being involved in the insurance company's heavy duty plan, which included a donation to the state's insurance director.
Greg Lindberg and two co-owners are accused of attempted bribery by Mike Cozy.
Lindberg, founder of insurance and investment companies, donated more than $500 million to state and federal election candidates and committees since 2016, and has been the top political donor in recent years.
Lindberg supported Republican principles and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
Lindberg's lawyer called for a comment on Friday and email, but did not respond.
On Friday, Hannes Davis, the defendant of Hayes, requested an additional comment by e-mail, but did not respond.
The court documents submitted to Friday stated that Hayes had made false statements to FBI agents in August 2018, but Hayes did not speak with Cozy about the staff of the State Insurance Bureau.
However, according to the facts, Hayes was actually talking about the request of state insurance supervisors and personnel transfer from Lindberg.
The prosecutor said that Hayes helped Lindberg's request to meet him with Cozy, and that he spoke directly with the supervisor.
The prosecution announced in April claimed that Lindberg had sought special treatment for his own insurance business, and that he was planning to raise $200 million to campaign for Cozy's 2020 re-election.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request to replace the authorities who had reviewed the company of Lindberg.
Republican Cozy reported an attempted bribe to federal agents and helped them.
Cozy has no doubt.
In a conversation, including Lindberg and Cozy, the co-owner of Lindberg instructed Hayes to send $25 million to Cozy's re-election campaign.
According to an indictment, Hayes was initially opposed to paying attention if he moved so expensive money, but eventually broke out in the conversation.
In the prosecution, Hayes said, "What do you want?"
i know, i'll do it.
The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office called for further information on judicial transactions via e-mail but did not respond.

Garrick said, "There was a very positive feedback from many bullying groups and mental health organizations working together."

Garrick said that it is expected that users will be able to share with this platform more safely than they feel competitive.
Garrick stated that business operators on Facebook would receive the same metrics and insights as they had previously accessed.
In the country where Instagram tests such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Ireland, etc. are conducted, it is very early to say that tests are conducted in the same way.
Facebook's Instagram does not announce when the test ends or changes.
"There was initially a positive feedback on Instagram experience, but now it's a step to listen to and learn feedback," Garrick said.
Garrick, in Australia, the world's training country, pointed out that Australia has a very aggressive Facebook and Instagram user.
He thought Australia would be a great country to get really good feedback on whether this is a valuable experience for people or not.

One day, I got my favorite bag and I couldn't move somewhere.
If your favorite bag is broken, you want to repair it somehow and continue to love it.
When I helped him, he was a handcrafted part of Cando.
when i gave up
Her mother's broken bag, the neck is the ultimate pchipra.
Therefore, if you ask the shop to repair it, it became a situation that greatly exceeded the original price.
Unfortunately, my mother said, "I don't want to give up."
First of all, I visited the Home Center and looked for the replacement of this connected fitting.
However, even if there are rings, all of them are silver.
Gold was not seen at all.
When I went to Candu, I finally found it!
I was impressed when I discovered it in the handicraft corner.
It's 100 percent as expected.
Originally, it looks like a part used for key holders and Charm DIY.
We purchased two bags at each end of the bag handle.
The size of the ring is small, but if you put it on one side of the bag, make it exactly the same ...
This opens the way to bag repair.
It is a smooth installation.
dokidki ...!
The ring opening is designed to break inside and is resistant to pulling outwards.
I attached it to the bag.
The color of the girdle feels good with the gold system ♪ However, because the ring size is small, the movement is poor ...
So I decided to put the ring in two pairs.
The amount of metal fittings has increased, but because of lightweight parts, the weight is not quite a problem.
Rather, I feel that the number of parts has increased and the design level has improved.

Pakistani social media star Candy Barochi's honorable murder and his brother's life imprisonment.
Candy Barochi, who gained fame in photos posted on social media, was hanged in July 2016.
His brother, a popular social media player in Pakistan, was convicted of the murder of his sister on Friday, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment in honor of his father's most attention in Pakistan.
In July 2016, Burrought was narrowed down.
His brother, Muhammad, was arrested.
His brother said in a press conference a few days later that he killed his sister, and that his sister's actions were "not allowed" and that he did not regret what he did.
Mr. Saldar Memoud, a lawyer, told AFP that the court of Murtan, the eastern city, was convicted and sentenced to life in a waiting sentence.
He said, "I will be innocent in the Supreme Court."
Prior to this, Balochi's mother, Annwar Mai, told AFP that his son wanted to be innocent.
"There is no sin for my son.
My daughter and my son."
Balochi's murder has become a major news all over the world, and as lightening the rules of his father's right-of-law society, the voices of victims and women are reburning, asking for action against the spread of so-called " honorary murder."
In the case of Mr. Baruche, the woman chooses her own marriage partner, and in the case of her own sexuality, she burns in crimes such as shameful of her family, killing, killing, and killing her.
The killing is usually done by close relatives.
After that, Pakistan's Kisars and Deyas (retribution) laws allow the perpetrators to be forgiven from their relatives.
Three months after Barochi's murder, Congress passed a new bill that required life imprisonment for honorable homicide.
However, at the discretion of the judge whether the murder is an honorable crime, the murderer can claim another motive in theory and may be pardoned.
In the case of Mr. Baruche, his parents initially claimed not to give him forgiveness.
However, the sad parents thought they would lose their son and asked them to change their thoughts and forgive their son.
In response to international hatred for killing, the Pakistani government took unprecedented measures to declare the country as a successor with their parents, but the lawsuit continued.
Balochi's famous actions include offering a strip show to the Pakistan Cricket Team, and wearing a straight red dress with a wide open chest on Valentine's Day.
It became critical and threatening, but it was recognized by many people, including young people, as it opened up new heaven and earth in a country where it was considered a political activity to express oneself as a presence like Kim Kadasian to improve the status of women boldly.
The origins of "respectful" homicide are ethnic social norms, and are still widespread in South Asia, especially in women's behavior, but men may be victims.

In addition to actively collaborating in projects conducted by both organizations, such as training guidance for various competitions, we will establish a mutual support system in terms of health management and prevention of injury, such as when children from remote islands travel outside the island.
When the two organizations engage in training related to sports, they mediate, dispatch, and share information.
When a team of remote islands embark on an expedition outside the island, they will address issues such as the difficulty of the trainer in terms of travel expenses.
Specifically, in cooperation with the Kagoshima Sports Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the ASA, in cooperation with the prefectural convention, etc., in the event of the tournament on the mainland, we will support the team to prevent the performance of the athletes due to fatigue during the voyage and night stay.

Kenichiro Shigeki "It is now a time when traditional common sense breaks."
(LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
Actually, as a brain scientist, Kenjiro Shigeki has been thinking twice about "mote."
"Bio-Scientific Mortology" is a surprise that uses vast knowledge and latest knowledge freely.
We will then send you a piece.
In the previous edition (see related article), Mote-no-Otoko firmly adheres to the traditional "male fantasy" and the pattern learning to make it is overwhelmingly insufficient!
Later, I talked about how to get rid of such a bad guy and become a cool, mote man.
if you are bound by what you should do, you want to live.
In the first part, I talked about the need to learn patterns every day by looking at various works and behavior.
When learning patterns, the brain will be able to organize actions so that it will be able to live in a rake.
I think I'm still evolving every day, depending on whether it's "mote."
That's why it's okay to live.
Since I had taught at Tokyo Tech and Tokyo University of the Arts, I talked a lot with young people and learned many patterns of interaction with them.
But if you're stuck in the position of a university professor there, you might be a bit painful if you're stuck in the old pattern of "the teacher of the university is more dignified."
I don't care about that, so it's fun every day.
After all, if you say, "What should I do?" or "What should I do?"
But even if I don't change, society will change.
I've been talking about this in my recent talk, "No matter how terrible it is in the world."
"Fourness" and "authority" are things that come naturally by admitting people around them.
He doesn't want to be light.
It's hard to ask yourself around.
Isn't you doing it at the Cannes Film Festival?
Although he was light, he would be treated as a "great film director."
Those who have a proven track record do not have to behave greatly.
In other words, if you are bound by "thinkness," you cannot do it lightly.
As long as I hear a lot of women, regardless of their position or age, it seems to be a sin mark and salvation for any man.
It's hard to say that this is cute.

In the northwest of Nigeria, the illegal state doubled to 40,000 refugees: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
According to the announcement of the UN on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria doubled by about 40,000 due to the intensifying violence in the last four months.
According to the UN Refugee Organization, a new humanitarian crisis has been created due to this confusion, and by the end of this year, each institution will work together to raise $35 million.
The UNHCR spokesman Barbar Barrok stated that the Islamic extremist Bokohalam, which has been active in the northern part of Nigeria for ten years, is unrelated to the recent multiple armed attacks.
Rather, the increased violence in Nigeria's Sokot, Zamfara, and Kazina over the last decade was organized by armed groups.
"We often show the horror of illegal and unstable situations," said Barrok on Friday.
The kidnapping, torture, assault, murder and sexual violence are frequently occurring, and the raiders are working to destroy their homes and steal them.
Military and police are also sent to confront criminal organizations in the region.
However, the army was exhausted in battle with Bokoham and the West African branch of Islamic State, which was split from the former organization in 2016.
"The refugees don't come with a group name," says Balok.
What they carry is a terrible experience story.
Most of the refugees pass to neighboring Niger.
In a statement, UNHCR announced that the security situation in Sokot was deteriorating, and that refugees across Niger would increase in the coming months.
The new trial date for men killed two women and children is confirmed.
The trial date of the Guatemalan men who were killed by two women and their children in Iowa was confirmed.
According to the Polk County Court records, Marvin Escobar Orillana (31) was prosecuted for the first-class murder in three cases, the alleged name of Marvin Esquibel Lopez, who was originally referred to by the authorities.
He claims innocence.
According to the police, on 16 July, in a demo-in house, he shot Rossibes Flores Rodriguez (29), her daughter (11) and son (5).
In the court's record, a new date of trial will be determined on January 27 and the time to prepare the plaintiffs and defendants will be given.
According to officials of the U.S. Immigration Control Bureau, Escobal Orileana was illegally staying in the U.S. and was forced back twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegal immigration to the United States in 2010.
Sonet Media Networks (SMN) began advertising on header bindings by "Preid.js" at LFP.
LFP is a service that enables customers to purchase and plan their own advertising frameworks according to their needs.
The Service provides an effective advertising framework through DSP through collaboration with media companies.
Header binding is a mechanism that allows a fair bid competition in multiple bidders (adverted companies) to prioritize high-priced advertising in media operated by media.
As a solution for media companies that are transparent and likely to improve profitability, the introduction of large media is progressing.
In the past, SSP has been provided for advertising frameworks.
In order to respond to requests from advertisers in recent years, "I want to deliver to a specific advertising frame with high affinity with individual commercials and brand images," the LFP launched in December last year, in collaboration with media companies, directly buying advertising frames that accompany advertisers' requests.
In response to header binding, the introduction of LFP will be expanded.
The benefit of advertisers is that LFP header bindings allow them to directly participate in bids for header bindings and increase the delivery opportunities for advertising.
In addition, due to limited media coverage, the advertising framework for each commercial or brand image is secured to prevent damage to brand value.
The benefits of media companies are said to be the solution to bundle and manage the code of Bedder companies called "Lapper Solution" in which LFP works together, allowing them to work closely with the hope of introducing media companies.

Two months to stop Assistant Professor Yamagata at Pawahara | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 27th, Yamagata University announced on the 27th that the assistant professor at Yonezawa Campus was suspended for two months.
The punishment is the same date.
According to the Department of General Affairs, in October 2017, when teaching multiple students belonging to the laboratory, Assistant Professors repeated intimidating behavior, such as emotional and insulting in inappropriate words, and gave strong mental stress.
He was a professor of education and recognized that the school environment deteriorated.
In a survey conducted in September 1818, several students appealed.
In addition, in December of the same year, the management of the Faculty of Engineering met with students and assistant professors, and in December of the same year, the faculty of the Yonezawa Campus conducted a survey of harassment prevention measures committees.
Based on the findings from the committee, President Kiyohito Oyama and the Board of Directors decided to disciplinary action.
Even after the survey, Assistant Professors continued to receive education, but the practice was improved through interviews, and he said, "I'm sorry."
President Koyama commented, "I would like to express my deep gratitude to the victims and other stakeholders, and I would like to take all my studies to prevent harassment and strive to recover confidence."
In addition, the Ministry of Engineering has been conducting internal investigations to determine whether a female student has committed sexual harassment by a male teacher.
The San Paper demands Boris Johnson to reduce the demands of withdrawal from the EU and make a compromise with the EU.
Now, only three weeks after the EU summit, which will be a settlement, there is a growing concern over the prime minister that the prime minister might not be able to take a significant concession.
Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion in the cabinet demanding a reduction in the demands of withdrawal from the EU and a compromise with the EU.
The negotiations over a new tariff system that replaces the backstop clauses related to the Irish border are packed, and the EU considers Johnson's alternatives as "improvable."
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black curtains led by the German Prime Minister Angela Merkel will propose a compromise proposal, including a three-year time limit on the backstop.
The Sun spoke to three ministers, who were ready to confront the Prime Minister after the Conservatives' annual meeting in Manchester next week.
They urge the Prime Minister to abandon the "strong" strategy that threatens the EU, which was devised by the senior advisor Dominique Camings, without agreement, and insist that the EU will accept the offer that the EU will be out of limit time.
One cabinet member said that the ruling that the Supreme Court was illegal on Tuesday was "the alarm bell," and that the compromise was the only way we could leave on October 31.
We will never win in the House and they oppose us.
The Prime Minister must use what can be used more than a step.
There is no effect even if it is radical, and the plan of Camings is obviously unsuccessful.
It is impossible to fight in so many fields.
Another cabinet promised that he would speak to Johnson to run an agreement with Prime Minister Terry the May.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I will talk to Boris to return Terryza's agreement to the House."
There are a number of reasons for this, and everyone is trying to end this.
If we fail to postpone, Boris will end and we will end.
Sir John Mayer condemned Boris not seriously thinking about negotiations.
The leader of the Conservative Party said in a harsh speech: "The prime minister wants to connect with the EU.
However, we do not see the Prime Minister's meeting with the EU to establish an agreement.
Instead, we saw Scotland's prime minister fighting with bulls, inspecting eggs in the Uères, and discussing with the people in the streets.
The prime minister's press yesterday admitted that the agreement was still a long time ahead and said, "If no one wants to achieve the goal, the road is still long."
However, the press also stated that the bill to force a three-month delay if an unconstitutional withdrawal would significantly weaken the position of our negotiations in Brussels.
The press said, "There is no doubt that this bill hinders our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to continue their progress despite the enactment of the bill."
The European Union withdrawal minister Stephen Berkeley returns to Brussels today to discuss further with Michel Barnier of the EU.
The two discuss how the regulation of all Irish islands on food and livestock works.
Lorraine Kelly: I told Glasgow accents that it would never be a success in the television world.
Lorraine Kelly, in his Glasgow accent, revealed that he was told by the boss of the television station that he would "not succeed."
Before appearing on television for the first time, Kelly, 59-year-old, recalled 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I'm still 25 years old and I'm very nervous," she says.
I worked as a researcher at the BBC Scotland Branch and told my boss that your Glasgow accent would not succeed in the absolute television industry.
Before taking over the Glasgow office, I went to London to meet everyone in the TV-am team and see where the show was broadcast.
I never forget that morning Ann Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewed by legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe he was in the same room as a living legend.
I found out that my place is here.
Kelly began working as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kilbrid, Scotland, and became a TV-am Scotland correspondent in 1984.
In addition, Kelly served as host of the show, including GMTV and ITV's Breckfast and Daybreak, and then began her name-name program, Lorraine.
To celebrate the 35th anniversary, Kelly's most memorable scenes and interviews will be broadcast.
He added that passion, enthusiasm, and curiosity were the secret to survival in the television industry, and that the moderator said, "We have to put it into work."
You must be honest and sincere.
I am interested in various people and interested in what I should do.
Looking back on the news that was shocked by her heart, Kelly revealed that it was "very painful."
The next day after the terrible incident that 16 students and teachers were killed, I didn't think we were seeing a lot of children who were killed or injured who broadcast the show live from Danbulane.
Pam Ross, one of the mothers and five-year-old daughter Joanna's daughter, told me personally, so we talked for hours at her house.
I went to Joanna's funeral and Pam and I've been friends since.
In 2007, Kelly interviewed her and her husband when Kate and Gerry McKan's daughter Madley were missing, saying that it was "very painful" and said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple."
The couple must endure the painstaking nets that do not know what is happening to their beloved daughter.
The couple won't really be poisoned.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary program is broadcast on ITV from 8:30 am on Monday, September 30.
Zimbabwe, fear of traps.
According to government officials, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga declined due to anxiety that the offer of President Robert Mugabe's office in the midst of a political change might be a trap that could lead to military action in November 2017.
During the coup, negotiations between Mugabe and the Defense Forces continued, and Mugabe offered Chiwenga to give him the presidency, and the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week.
However, the reason why Chiwenga refused the offer was that he saw Mugabe's intention to use Chiwenga to inform the leaders and African Unions around the world that he was deprived of the regime in a coup rather than anxiety.
According to a series of tweets by Jamwada2, officials confirmed that it was a high-ranking official of the Cabinet Office, "Mugabe, who has held the government for 37 years, is willing to give the government to Chiwenga instead of Emerson Munangagwa," and it is said that intense negotiations were made at that time.
Mugabe, who realized he was losing power, told the government officials that he tried to contact Chiwenga by messengers.
According to government officials, arbitration between the military headquarters and the late and former presidents was carried out by three.
George Charanba, president of Spokesman, and Aaron Nepela, the top representative of the Central Information Organization of the time, and the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis Mukonoli, who were involved in negotiations, said the senior officials.
Gideon Gono, the former president of the Zimbabwe Preparatory Bank, was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the President's seat to commander Chiwenga.
Mugabe, who became a symbol of Africa after his death, attempted to condemn the African Union's actions while seeking intervention by African leaders, but failed.
The offer to transfer the president's position to the former CDF (commander of Chiwenga) was not by the choice of the late president.
"Some of the late President's family began to suffer from fatigue, and it was a wasteful action to save the rapidly expanding situation," he wrote.
However, at least diplomatically alone, the political aim of the late president was a little bit.
If you want to destroy the constitutional order, you would have to clash with the views of the African Union on the coup, but remember that the commander had declared that it would not break the constitutional order and would not break it.
The late President Mugabe hoped that Chiwenga, the top military officer of the time, would trap and destroy the claims of commanders claiming to have not broken the constitutional order.
The late President Mugabe wanted the African Union to decide whether to position as a coup without grasping the entire situation yet, but ultimately to be considered valid, without being called a coup.
It was intended and calculated at the bottom of the offer.
When the defense forces noticed that they were not protected, Mugabe was moving, and officials speak.
He was warned that he would be executed like Kadafi, and Mugabe said he had to write his resignation.
The commanders of the army told Mugabe that even if they invaded the president's house, they would not turn guns to the citizens.
At that point, Mugabe wanted two things to protect his family, and to prove his power deprivation by the military.
The commanders and commanders at that time read exactly their intentions.
The words "Is Tiri Bemacwapa Macwapa" (which we belong to the Kamo Fullerge group, the military department), were used to express the powerful metaphor that we had not been a politician but had no political competition."
The Army told the local commanders that through military officers who were staying in Zimbabwe, the purpose was to remove the "criminals" surrounding him rather than to defeat Mugabe.
In order to discuss the coups and successors, Mugabe attempted to call Munangagwa, a short-term exile in South Africa using the same method.
In addition to negotiations with the Army, Mugabe needed support from the region.
Not only had economic power and power in the region, but also because President Jacob Zuma was the chairman of the South African Development Community at that time, the key South Africans refused to intervene, but as they repeatedly threatened behind them, it was clear that the South African army would immediately be sent to Harare.
"Just because it wasn't supported by Putin and African leaders, it was not possible to achieve it," the information sources tell the Independent.
The ratification of the treaty in 32 countries | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
[New York Joint] On the 26th of the UN headquarters in New York, a meeting aimed at a world without nuclear weapons was held, and a grandchild of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital (present-day Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Hospital) gave a speech by Mr. Takeuchi (63) of the second generation of atomic bombings, and appealed to the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
The next day, five new countries ratified the Treaty of Prohibition, and the ratification became 32 countries and regions.
The treaty must be ratified by 50 countries and regions.
The meeting and ratification were made according to the 26th International Day for the full elimination of nuclear weapons.
In recent years, Secretary General Guterres also expressed a strong concern that there has been a movement to reverse nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"We don't want to eliminate it."
China needs strong leadership, and if there is no need for collapse, policy documents
The Chinese government stated in a policy document published on Friday, prior to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, that the Communist Party would have a strong and unified leadership, and that the country would collapse.
In the White Paper, the Chinese State Council said that the success of the Communist Party over 70 years ago was due to the leadership of the party.
China is vast, and domestic conditions are complex, but there are few political problems.
Without a unified strong leadership, China will go to division and collapse, and will be a disaster for the world."
The Chinese authorities have long justified addressing problems in a rigid manner, such as the suppression of the democratization movement that occurred in Beijing in 1989.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping, who plays the leading role in the commemorative ceremony of the world's second largest economic power, has strengthened the control of the party since he held the government in late 2012.
He also directed a military modernization program that threatens the region.
China does not intend to export its own development model, nor does it intend to incorporate other models, but merely seek peace rather than hegemony.
Some Chinese genes do not invade or control other people.
In modern times, China suffered from bully from the column, and war and confusion left a deep scar with its pain; China would never be able to bring the pain he experienced to other people.
China is facing difficult issues such as the economic downturn and the anti-government movement in Hong Kong, China, as well as the economic downturn.
China will never abandon its core interests and will not allow the loss of security and sovereignty.
"The tariffs that continue to rise with the threat of trade war do not solve any problem," says White Paper in connection with the trade conflict with Washington.
China is a mature economic nation with the momentum of complete industrial systems, complete industrial chains, wide market spaces and strong economic development.
"It never weakens in the trade war."
I am confident that China is facing difficulties, turning crisis into opportunities, and opening a new world.
Since China does not have any idea to counter the U.S. and does not want to replace the U.S., the U.S. should calmly capture the development of China.
The United States cannot control China, and it is unlikely that China will stop its development.
If you want to suppress, suppress, and move the contradictions of other countries abroad, the United States will not maintain strength.
[High School Baseball] Yokohama Taka dismissed Hirata's director, Kaneko's chief, and the rumors were revealed (Sport News) - Yahoo! News
On the 28th, Yokohama Taka, a high school baseball master who won five national championships in spring and summer, announced that Toru Hirata (36) and Masao Kaneko (42) were dismissed on the same day.
In the future, Oteru Takayama will be acting as a coach and the director (responsor teacher) will decide promptly.
Director Hirata and Director Kaneko reported on the 26th that local paper had a rumor about baseball club members.
When the school side hears the situation from two people, Director Hirata grabbed the student's neck, and Kimko admitted some of the rumors.
In addition, based on the results of the survey conducted by 66 students, the two again confirmed the facts, and the fact was generally accepted and dismissed on 28 December.
In the summer of Yokohama, Motochizen WATANABE (74) director Motochika WATANABE, who raised Shosaka Daisuke (present-day Naka-day) and others, withdrew.
He became director of Hirata and director of Kaneko.
In the summer of the 16th century, he participated in the Kokoen Garden for three consecutive years, and in the spring Senbatsu.
In the summer, however, he lost to Sagamihara, the prefectural capital, and in the fall, he lost to Kiriko Gakuen in the semi-finals.
The Spice Girls' MelC and Severage Disturbance Diseases banned diet topics in their homes.
The Spice Girls' melanie Chizom has long recognized that diets are prohibited at home from the experience of their own eating disorders that do not eat anything other than fruits and vegetables.
The sporty spices, under pressure from members of the global pop group, have been "excessive exercise" for many years, and have been diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his experience was influenced by the child care of his daughter Scarlet, and stated that "every topic about diet in the family is prohibited."
"The Scarlett is now 10 years old, and I'm getting distracted by my appearance."
However, because I experienced eating disorders, I was very careful when I talked with my daughter.
Positive words, now it is a habit.
In the 1990s, as a member of Spice Girls, Mer told in an interview with Women's Health magazine that, in front of SNSdai, a "bad" comment on himself written in the press led to a physical problem.
"I couldn't take care of myself, I pulled out certain food groups, became more and more possessed by exercise, and I was too thin."
I was sick, and that condition lasted almost a few years."
The judgment of same-sex marriage, and the opportunity to spread diversity: Hokkaido Shimbun
The Utsunomiya District Court Maoka Branch made a decision to acknowledge the fact that "the marriage" in accordance with marriage was a dispute between the same sex.
There are more than 20 countries that recognize same-sex marriage, and there is no legal effect in Japan.
The decision was made to determine the fact that two women married.
It is considered the first judicial decision to recognize legal protection by the same sex couples and is meaningful.
As a result of the Civil Code and the provisions of the Family Register Law, there are five lawsuits for compensation in the country, including Sapporo.
In order to overcome the ruling, I would like to deepen my understanding of the rights of sexual minorities and deepen the discussion of the legal system to recognize the diverse families.
The women lived in the United States for about seven years and received a certificate of marriage in the United States.
The ruling was certified as "the reality of the fact that marriage between men and women does not change."
It is a revolutionary decision to extend the recognition of marriages with the right to marry in social insurance and other social insurance.
What's more important is the interpretation of Article 24 of the Constitution of "free marriage" as a marriage "only based on the mutual agreement."
Both sexes concluded that "it was not considered a sexual marriage at the time of establishment, and it is not understood until the purpose of denying the same-sex marriage."
"The Constitution is not supposed to be a same-sex marriage," but it is expected that it will be a driving force for the same-sex marriage lawsuits in various places.
On the other hand, since the same-sex marriage has not been recognized, "the benefits of legal protection between men and women are different."
While recognizing the same situation as between men and women, the difference in the right to protect may be unavoidable.
In the survey of national home trends for married women, about 70% of people who consider marriage to be legally recognized have changed their consciousness.
As lifestyle diversification progresses, the law is bound by traditional family statues to take away the rights of people who are not fit.
In fact, marriage is not a " spouse" recognized by law, so there are still few restrictions, such as the lack of preferential treatment in tax terms and the absence of joint custody.
In consideration of the same-sex marriage, it is necessary to review family legislation from a variety of perspectives, including not only the marriage between the same sex but also the expansion of legal rights of marriage.
to trial and jury trial of former athletes prosecuted for rape against multiple women
A jury trial was held at the former Delaware University baseball player's trial where several women were prosecuted for sexual assault.
On Friday, after ten days of testimony and speech, the jury began a review of Clay Conaway's fate.
The 21-year-old woman said she was sexually assaulted after sending her to her home by car.
After three weeks of meeting with them, Konaway sent her nude photos to women.
Conaway has been accused of sexual assault on six women between 2013 and 2018, and one of them.
The prosecution claimed that the woman resisted when the embrace of consent escalated and Conaway attempted to assault women.
The defense claimed that women's contradictions and memories were different and that women regretted having physical relationships.

[Dospo] Ota became No. 4 after his transfer, No. 20 for himself, and succeeded to the teaching of the retired Sanematsu & G Abe: Hokkaido Shimbun
It became a "return" to the seniors.
He took the lead four times, and on the left side, he made his 20th home run.
The goal was to reach the number of home runaways: "I stopped receiving this number and started trial and error.
His intentions were also firm.
It was the first time since the transfer.
He said, "I put it in the fourth place to change my mind."
Oda responded to his expectations: "I felt like it, and the result I entered the game, and I spent a day with pure excitement."
One of the four ideal statues is the giant Abe who retired from active duty in the season.
"The 4th is the core that leads the victory, and the 4th of the team is the 4th, and the 4th seniors who have seen the giants were the same."
Among them, "I think Abe's appearance is the most important, and it's a kind of self-style looking at such a back."

the serious pollution of popular tourist spots, videos clearly
Sydney Harbour is one of the largest tourist resources in Sydney, bringing $210 million to the Australian economy every year.
But under the bridge there is ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, where about 15 cups of pollutants flow every year.
Thanks to this terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist spots is one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video of the title, from Sydney Harbour to the bottom, the waterways around Australia's most popular cities are filled with mussels, plastic bags, plastic bottles, shoes, clothes, and even animal corpses.
Among them, the biggest factor is plastic.
Dr. Catherine Duffon, vice president of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, said, "This is paradox."
The appearance is certainly beautiful, but one of Japan's coastlines is quite modified and polluted.
According to CSIRO, plastics of 1560 kilograms per hour flow into the waterways, most of which flow into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"There were several heavy rains, but after that, Sydney Harbour was pretty tragic," Dr. Duffon said.
Two thirds of pollution flow from rainwater flowing through the road surface.
But it's like a corner of the iceberg, and 70 percent of plastics flowing into the ocean are deposited in the sea floor.
"I really don't know what's going on under the sea level, but I don't know what's going on there," said Richard Nichols, owner, Dive Center Manley, who collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste every year by himself and his team.
If a lot of people know more (what is under the water surface), I think everyone will be really cool.
But overwhelmingly, more than half of what we find is plastic bags.
The remaining half of the plastic is used at least somewhere.
Sydney Harbour is beautiful at first glance, and I can't believe anyone can believe that all plastics and garbage flows down the water immediately.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and directors of Ocean Protection, said that local residents may also be able to reduce plastic and waste flowing into the waterways.
he says, we should start from the source of origin.
Reduce the use of plastics, recycle more well, and finally flow into the sea, so you have to focus more on what is flowing into the drain.
50 percent of the oxygen we suck is coming from the ocean, so hurting the ocean will kill us.
The oceans absorb 30 percent of carbon dioxide and are food sources.
However, we will repair Sydney Harbour and return to the old scene, but it is very simple.
killing the sea is killing humans.
A new study of plastic and mental health was also announced this month, as part of the activities of the Australian public to widely know about environmental protection and the reduction of the impact of beverage containers that remain in the natural environment.
According to a new study, 82 percent of the 546 children from 12 to 18 years old have a sense of despair about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
In the same study, both parents and parents ranked fourth on concerns about plastic waste, and reported that 93 percent of the parents surveyed felt increasingly anxious about the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, which led to ecological anxiety.
The former Karatsu Power Station, which has been demolished since October | Saga News | Saga Newspapers
The demolition work started in October, and the chimney of the former Karatsu power plant started: Nitako in Karatsu City
Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. announced on October 26 that it would begin to dismantle the chimneys of the former Karatsu Power Station (oil-fired power plant) located in Nitako, Karatsu City.
Construction will be completed by the end of March 2021.
The dismantlement was two used to discharge gas during power generation, with a height of about 180 meters.
The original three were removed in 1991.
Each chimney splits from top to bottom with a tower crane.
The plan takes nine months to break down, and 18 months to complete.
The time to break the remaining turbines and boilers is uncertain.
There is a sad voice, and a 60-year-old man who runs a restaurant nearby said, "When you look back from afar and see a chimney, it's like a symbol that gives you the feeling of returning to Karatsu.
The former Karatsu Power Station began operation in 1967, and the first unit was abolished in 89 and the second unit was abolished in 2015.
It is located in the corner of Karatsu Higashi Port and has an area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because there is a nearby prefectural yacht harbor and JR Nishi Karatsu Station, the prefecture and the city want to use the site.
Three people, including nine, signed an agreement on the use of the site in 15 years.
Product development with local fish Sales such as Owashi Taka Fishnut Mie - Ise Shimbun
[Students who promote fishnaggets and rice cooked in Thailand]
[Owashi] Four third-year students from Takao Eagle High School Information Business Department in Kodono-cho, Owashi City, Mie Prefecture developed fish naggets and rice cooked in Thailand using locally fried fish.
It was sold at the school's cultural festival on 26th.
It is part of the satellite high-level collaboration project of the Mie University East Kishu University, which aims to revitalize the water industry and forestry industries in the region of Toki Province.
The product developed is a fish-naggage made from mutts that are caught in the Kumano Nada and a cooking rice cooked using a fish-naggage made from Owashi's farmed rice.
He said he was targeting young people.
Fishnaggets have developed three kinds of tofu, including tofu and a special gas shrimp from the tail eagle.
Kumano Fishing Co. cooperated with them, and they were worn at the processing site of Yugi-cho, Kumano City.
Thai rice mixed with shiitake and carrots.
The seafood company of Hayashi-cho, Owashi City, is directly responsible for cooking "Oshio-no-machi."
The school began in June.
They visited the Owashi factory and deepened their understanding of the water industry.
During the workshop, participants discussed the needs of consumers and tried prototypes.
He also invented naggets using a hydrangea, but because of the smell of fish, he adopted mutts.
Mr. Masaki Yamaguchi (17) said, "It's a product that can be eaten by people who are not good at fish, and I'm glad that many people can eat it."
It is said that they are negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell goods.
That's why I am now (CBC TV) - Yahoo! News
This time, Mr. Mama Takahashi, a free announcer and a monthly commentator on CBC TV, said about his master.
the advice of the master who saved me rotten
For me, actor Hideki Takahashi is like a master beyond his father.
Despite the same industry, my father is an actor and I am an announcer.
I don't know what I'm doing, but my father taught me how to do my best in the industry, how to get my heart, and what is important to me as a working person.
When I was struck by the fact that I was told to be a TV announcer with a 20% effort, my father said, "I didn't think it would be a good thing if I was hurt, but my father said, "I thought it would be a good thing.
After that, when I joined the company in my second and third year, I had only a job called "Anyone with an empty female Anna is good," and when I wasn't motivated by what I wanted to do, and my heart was rotten, I asked everyone to do my best.
I learned naturally from my father's play.
There may be a lot of people who haven't seen me reading the news, but actually after joining the TV station, I've been in touch with the news all the time with the narration of BS and news shows.
I thought the personality and sense of the announcer would come out when reading the news manuscript, and Mr. Matsuko deluxe said, "I'm good at reading Mama's news."
When I read the news, what I feel is important and sense is "between."
It has been cultivated by watching his father's stage, films, television, and historical dramas during his childhood.
In other words, I think this is thanks to my father because I have a lot of experiences from my childhood.

The final event in Japan was held in Hokkaido in 2010.
What is WRC resurrected in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship is one of the four World Championships in which Formula One (F1) and the World Endurance Championship are held.
Since 1973, it has become the world's highest rallying championship with a history and tradition, and it is said that the competition will be the most challenging car competition to run fast on various road surfaces such as gravel road and snow road.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won the WRC Manufacturings title from 1999 and became a big topic.
This time, the Japan Round Preparatory Committee was established to host Japan's wish.
As a result, the 2020 WRC Japan Round was decided to be held at the World Motorsports Council, the highest voting body of the International Automobile Federation.
The two governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, as well as Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.) and Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.) are talking about the Japanese round.
Governor of Aichi Prefecture Hideaki Omura
"We sincerely welcome the FIA World Rally Championship 2020 to be held in Japan, and as the center of motorsports representing Japan, we will work together with stakeholders to make our best efforts to achieve the success of the 2020 Autumn Games."
Mr. Hajime Furuta, Governor of Gifu Prefecture
"I am very pleased that the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here in 2020, where the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.This is the first global motor sports competition for the prefecture, and I am looking forward to seeing you very much."
Mr. Akio Toyota (President and CEO of Toyota Motor)

In addition, the Japan Round Preparation Committee will hold a decision meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 venue, and the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019 will be held on November 9 and 10, 2019.
is it the key to cancer treatment?
Tusmaniadeville may hold the key to cancer treatment - researchers are opening a breakthrough that could bring significant reform to patient treatment.
Medical researchers have found out how some cancer cells are camouflaged.
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmaniadeville and humans.
The findings suggest that new ways of treating cancer patients are born.
What is common with Tasmaniadeville and humans?
It is a cancer cell that cannot be seen.
The team, including researchers at Peter McClellan Cancer Center in Melbourne, found that if there were cancers that did not respond to immunotherapy, they could significantly change the treatment for cancer.
It may be the key to addressing fatal face tumors that threaten the future of Tasmaniadeville on the verge of extinction.
In this study, some cancer cells in humans and bags used a series of proteins called PRC2 to react to cam Fullerage, and the immune system could not attack cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and Merkel cells.
Peter McClellan researcher Mark Dowson said, "The very important thing in this project is that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy."
Reuse traditional treatments, revitalizing markers, i.e. proteins known as MHC, and immune systems may be able to identify cancer cells.
"It may have a significant impact on lung cancer patients," Dr. Doson said.
"The lung cancer is a disease that spread throughout the world.
And treatment may be much better.
Researchers expect this discovery ultimately to be used to treat the face-to-face tumor of Tasmanian devils, where cancer cells escape detection.
"It's amazing that exactly the same process will happen (to humans and Tasmanian devil cancer)," Professor Doson said.
"It was very difficult to treat Tusmaniadeville tumors.
However, if a drug that is effective in humans can be used in Tasmaniadeville, it may help control the tumor."
scientists are puzzled by giant planets orbiting polar stars.
Scientists have discovered and amazed the solar system covering the current understanding of planetary formation by orbiting a giant Jupiter-shaped planet around a small star called red dwarf, 30 light-years away from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of a giant gas planet GJ3512b around its star red dwarf was released.
Stars are usually larger than the largest planet orbiting around them.
However, in this case, there is no difference in the size of stars and planets, and researchers told Thursday.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% of the Sun, but the planet orbits around it has at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"That's another surprise," said Juan Carlos Morales, an astronomical physicist at the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Science, who led this research in science.
The theoretical model shows that normally low-mass stars are the main stars of small planets similar to Earth and small Neptune.
In this case, we discovered a giant gas planet similar to Jupiter around a very small star."
The planet, composed mainly of gas, like Jupiter, was discovered using a telescope at the Coloral Alto Observatory in Spain.
The planet orbits around the star for 204 days.
The red dwarf is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.
The GJ3512 is not only quite small than our Sun, but also about 35% larger than Jupiter.
Because the emission energy is small, it is darker than the sun, and the surface temperature is about 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6380° / 3527°).
That's why I have a red color."
While there are traces of the second planet orbiting the star, Morales said that the third planet could have been released from its star system in the past and explained the elliptic orbit of the Jupiter-type planet.
Planets are generated from the same disk, consisting of interstellar gases and dust, which generate stars orbiting themselves.
The most influential planetary formation model, called the "core integrated" model, produces objects from solid particles in the disk, and the surrounding gas becomes atmosphere by pulling the eggs of the planet.
A conflict model called a self-gravity instability model may explain this rare planetary system.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk surrounding the newly born star might be slightly larger than it was thought, and the temperature might be lower."
As the disc becomes unstable in this state, some dense areas may also appear.
These masses may grow until they collapse and form planets.
the deli employee, the mundip of the stimulant is eaten by his colleagues and prosecuted.
Marion County Sheriff's Office Cassandra Medina Hernandes (38) is accused of eating dipping beans with awakening agents to his colleagues.
On Thursday, Allbani's Cassandra Animina Hernández (38) was accused of being charged with the transfer of methane fetamine and the transfer of regulatory drugs to others.
The charges were attributed to the incident that occurred at the Sliftway grocery store in Jefferson County on September 9.
According to the estimate of the oath issued by OregonLive.com, the suspect's colleague (27) went to Deli for lunch and asked him to make a little taste because Medina Hernández saw him making beans dip.
According to the oath, the victim told the investigators that he had never done methane fetamine before, "I thought it would taste strange after eating something, but I didn't think it was a good drug."
When the woman returned to work, her stomach became worse and her legs were fluffy.
According to Albanie Democrat Herald, a local hospital where women went was judged to have had methane fetamine mixed with beans dip.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Sliftway employee said that Medina Hernández told the victim's food "I told him to put drugs," while the third employee told the police that the suspect sent a message that he accidentally put methane fetamin into beans dip.
According to the Oregon Live article, a surveillance video seized by Deer shows that Medina Hernández is stuck in the back of the camera and behind the microwave.
After that, he was standing up and wiped his nose and walked toward the table to put a dip of beans into a small paper dish.
The police said that the items taken from the brager were placed on the plate.
According to the Oregon Statesman Journal, the sheriff said that there are no customers who have been contaminated food for now.
Medina Hernández was detained in Marion County Prison, instead of $250,000 bail.
According to The Smoking Gun, the long-term arrest record of Medina Hernández has a history of assault, robbery, suffrage, transfer of methane fetamine, theft, possession of methane fetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.

At the press conference on the 27th, Mr. Shinko Kinko of JR Tokai reiterated his stance on early construction, stating that the issue of reducing the flow rate of the Oigawa River due to the construction of the linear Chuo Shinkansen Minami Alps tunnel is a matter of concern with Shizuoka Prefecture.
In particular, he said, "We will talk about the meeting place and the front stage."
Mr. Kaneko stressed, "It's not quite a start-up to organize a lot of problems, and I think it's possible to divide such issues."
On the other hand, he said, "This is our idea, and we have to talk about it."
The prefecture has a strong concern about the fact that spring water in the tunnel cannot be returned to the Oi River.
Regarding changing the construction method for this response, he expressed the view that "If there is a practical possibility, I think it is difficult to think about the safety aspects of the construction work."
The change of the route mentioned by Governor Kawakatsu Hirata denied that it was impossible.
On the impact of the opening period, President Kaneko pointed out three locations: the South Alps Tunnel, Shinagawa Station, and Nagoya Station as a time-consuming location.

My state lost one of the best politicians," said Ibiy in the statement.
The Deputy Minister of Defense posted a post at night before the apology for the Helic Accident | Saga News | Saga Shimbun
He posted to Twitter on the 26th night of the 26th anniversary of the Deputy Minister of Defense Yamamoto.
i deleted it around 11:30 AM.
In February of last year in Chiyoda-cho, Kanda City, Saisai, the last report of the accident that a combat helicopter crashed into a residential area was posted on Twitter by Mr. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, who entered Saga Prefecture for explanation and apology.
After meeting with the governor on 27th, he removed the post.
Mr. Yamamoto said, "I visited Saga Prefecture on a business trip tonight!"
In addition to the photo of a member of the Iwata Kazuchikashuin, the Minister of Defense, who attended the meal, he wrote, "It's delicious!
Mr. Yamamoto later added on Twitter that it was a mistake of "a chicken."
Mr. Taro Kono, Minister of Defense, answered, "Let's look at Tweets" at the press conference on the morning of 27th.
On the afternoon of 27 p.m., after an explanation of the prefecture and its relationship with the city, Yamamoto responded to the press coverage saying, "If you feel uncomfortable with my transmission, it is not my intention."
He stressed that he had been removed by his own judgment and avoided the word whether Tweets were inappropriate.
One of the local officials explained on 27th from Mr. Yamamoto said, "What are you thinking?"
Mr. Yamamoto was elected to the Kanto region in proportion to four times.
He took office in the cabinet reform this month.
In the accident, two men on the helicopter were killed.
Michelle Obama, instagram, praised megan markle as inspiration.
On Thursday, Michel Obama highly appreciated Megan Markle at a favorable Instagram, calling the Duke of Sussex "a thoughtful leader who breaks the mold and makes the world better."
The duke and Prince Harry attended the reception of young people this week and met with the executive of the Obama Foundation.
The former president, Mrs. Motonaga, wrote a very positive post, saying, "We will break the old custom and make the world better, my friend, Princess of Sassex @sussexroyal, thank you."
Mrs. Obama posted a photo of Mrs. Maygan, who poses with the executive of the Foundation, adding that "even with the interview with the executive of the Obama Foundation, the support of girls around the world who seek appropriate education is stimulating many people."
Formerly a "suit" actress, she served as guest editor in the September issue of Vogue magazine and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In a frank conversation, Mrs. Motonaga recalled how her mother and mother changed her.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "The mother is like a senior class to let go."
My job was almost always as a mother to find myself that children want to grow and keep the right distance.
To find out who they are, in essence, they are not the ideals for children as parents or the admiration of their childhood.
In the interview of Good Housekeeping magazine, Mrs. Obama, who really knows the pressure on spotlights in the world, advised the duke little by little.
"Sometimes, pressure from themselves and people around me can feel too large."
So it's my biggest advice that I don't have time to do anything.
In the first few months of the White House, instead of starting to work ambitiously, the girls began to live happily in school and careed for new friends.
I think it's good, but rather good.

Trump Hotel owner's suitability also holds a license to sell liquor.
Washington (AP) - The Commission on Alcohol and Beverage in Washington dismissed the appeal that Washington should review the local Trump International Hotel's license to sell liquors because of the question of owner's fitness.
On Wednesday, the Commission complained by three senators, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders that most of the petitioners were not resident in Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, in accordance with the State Law, which requires the applicant's "suitability" to obtain a license to sell alcohol, the appeal to cancel the right to provide alcohol at the hotel is second.
The first appeal submitted in the summer of last year claimed a repeated deception against Trump's assault and violated the state law.
The appeal was dismissed because the permit was already approved.
This would be the second time the license was renewed.
The honey collected by Bentley's "Five Bees" is the first harvest!
How about the taste of honey collected by FlyingBees who are bred on the b knee?
In May 2019, a set-up bee was started on the site of the UK Bentley Crew Factory, and the first honey was harvested in September of the same year.
The bees of workers who were not inferior to staff working at the crew factory gathered more than 100 bottles from just two nest boxes.
Why did Bentley make bees on the factory grounds that assemble cars?
I want to taste this!
Here is the honey that Bentley works.
Peter Bosch, executive director of Bentley's manufacturing department, commented as follows.
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we established a nest box for the first time in the vast grounds of the Crew Plant this year.
The beekeepers watched the scene from wild flowers planted on the site and the surrounding mountains where honey bees are gathering various flowers.
I found that this place is suitable for beekeeping, and it is wonderful to have so much harvest in the first year.
Through the Crew Plant and the Company's business, Bentley has conducted a wide range of activities as much as possible to the top of a sustainable luxury car manufacturer, and the breeding of bees is part of this.
The staff are actively cooperating.
It is very nice to have the first harvest successfully, and next year we will install more nests and plan to increase the harvest amount of beet honey.
A small step will lead to the conservation of biodiversity in the region.
We will continue to implement various initiatives to play our own role."In May 2019, 12 million honeybees, FlyingBees, started.
And in September of the same year after a summer, the work of removing the nest from the nest box was completed, and the nest frame was sprinkled with a centrifugal separatist machine and filtered the dripped honey.
The bottles and packages of honey can also be seen with Bentley-like attention.
The label design was designed by Louise McClum, designer responsible for Bentley's interior.

The UK is a country that values tea time.
I would like to enjoy afternoon tea, not only Fennell Tea, which is compatible with honey, but also the bees of FlyingBees, etc.
The worst of the UK is the Cleveland Police and the fraud report.
The police were arrested by a police officer in the UK.
The Cleveland Police reported fraud in all areas inappropriately.
The Cleveland Police continued to "a serious deterioration," and the police director Phil Gomley said.
The police have replaced five police officers in six years and are now facing new calls for demolition.
According to the report, efforts to prevent crimes, arrest suspects, and protect the socially vulnerable.
The police officer Phil Gomley said, "We have continued to make a significant worse after our last investigation."
The police chief Mike Viell resigned in less than a year of office in January, but he was investigated for his actions as "a serious" and several unpublished charges.
The deputy director Adrian Roberts was arrested for serious illegal acts and suspended.
Captain Simon Harwood, last year, went to the Investigation Committee for the illegal act because of the fact that he was doing sexual acts.
He resigned from the police.
Conservative mayor Ben Howchin said: "This is a formal verification that the police have collapsed.
This is when the Interior Ministry intervenes."

Nancy Pelosi: William Bar was a "criminal" and impeachment was necessary to settle.
No one knows what's going on.
At present, we believe that we are involved in a cover-up incident and may take some time to investigate."
"I'm going to do my work based on the time to find facts and facts," said Pelosi.
In this week's White House record, Trump found that Ukraine's President Vladimir Zellensky asked the Vice President Joe Biden of the 2020 U.S. presidential election and his son's investigation.
According to a call record, Trump also found that he was asked to work with Mr. Bar and his personal advisor, Rudy Juliani.
Trump denied fraud.
CNN first noticed internal charges against Trump's actions involving Ukraine before more than a week of formal inquiry, reported on Thursday.
The Ministry of Justice, accused of inquiry by information agencies, decided that Trump's telephone talks would not extend to the investigation of political fund violations.
In response to the question that Bar should testify, Pelosi stated on Friday that the intelligence special committee would decide who to witness.
However, Pelosi added that Bar thinks he became a criminal.
Indeed, the bar was pretty long ago.
"Because the name of the bar was given from the beginning," said Pelosi, and touched on Trump's name on the telephone talks in July with the Ukrainian president.
It is interesting that Mr. Bar will be subject to judgment regarding the disposal of this accusation.
Mr. Pelosi said, "I am very concerned with the fact that Trump attacked the accused on Thursday as a spy, and the treatment of the spy was different in the past."
President's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Pelosi said that internal charges play an important role in the disclosure and publication of fraud in the U.S. government, and that "the president said nothing wrong about those who could provide information to the whistleblowers is a significant loss of the sum of the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi presented Trump's official impeachment of impeachment and wrote a historical step.
The call content is contained in the accusations released on Thursday, and the whistleblower claims that Trump abused the job rights to seek intervention in Ukraine in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also claimed that the White House advisers instructed officials to remove calls from the cabinet-level computer system and transfer them to special sensitive systems.

Ghana: Concerns about the composition of the Review Committee
Cofi Manu, a football advocate and executive at Secondi Hasukas, expressed concern about the composition of the next Ghana Football Association (GFA) review committee.
He questioned the inclusion of Chairman Frank Davis, and expressed dissatisfaction with the matter.
In the interview with GNA Sport, Mr. Manuel stated that he had an interest in the results of the judging process and that it was fair or questionable to include the chairman.
The Review Committee should consist of a fair and neutral member from an outside without prior interest, whether it is a relationship with each member.
For example, Davis signed with NC as a lawyer and wrote a letter to Osei Kuwak Palmer about 10% of his salary.
He is also known as Olympic supporters.
For these two reasons, Manuel argued that he had interests, and that the commission should not be allowed.
Mr. Manuel suggests that if the Olympic Board member Fred Papoe attends the committee, the relationship between the club and the chairman would result in a conflict of interest.
The committee members were scheduled to start their activities yesterday and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis, Corporate Governance Consultant, and Mr. Marian Barnoa, a lawyer, and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwar.
Other members include Reginald Ralliair, Marketing and Sales, and lawyer Richard Akpocavi.
The survey of the Fukui Chamber of Commerce found that 54 and 2% of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukui Prefecture think that "the minimum wage should be 1,000 yen."
In fiscal 2018, 90% of companies were recruited, while the percentage of companies that were able to secure the scheduled number was around 50% for new graduates and mid-term employees, and 30% for non-regular employees.
Companies who answered "approved" to raise the hourly salary to 1,000 yen included information related (100 percent), construction (70, 6 percent), and wholesale (61, 7 percent).
The percentage of "reverse" was the majority of the manufacturing industry (51-9 percent), the service industry (60/9 percent), including food and drink, and accommodation (60/9 percent).
The representative of the conference said, "There are many companies that think that it is difficult to secure human resources and increase labor costs, although there is a tendency to be a high percentage of opposition in industries with a lot of time-consuming parts."
The average amount of money was 895 yen (from 4 October to 829 yen in Fukui Prefecture).
When I heard about the hiring situation in March 19, the hiring of a new employee was 61/3 percent, the mid-term employment was 54-5 percent, and the non-regular employment was 15-4 percent.
It was 86%.
The percentage of companies that were able to secure the scheduled number was 44,7 percent, 50 and 3 percent, and nonregulars remained 31 and 1%.
In particular, the transportation industry (including 13 and 3 percent of new graduates, 37 and 5 percent) and construction (24, 1 percent of new graduates, 38 and 1 percent in the middle) struggled.
A total of 86 and 4% had challenges in hiring, and in order to increase the number of applicants, the company's reputation was low.
There were many voices asking for administrative measures in recruitment activities to strengthen the introduction function and provide information to new graduates (departures within three years after graduation) and mid-term recruitment.
There was also a view to encouraging student approaches, such as providing PR opportunities for students from outside the prefecture and supporting various internships.
15.3% of the country's sub-sector and/or business proposed in the growth strategy answered, "I already accept it."
In addition to 20 and 3% of "I'm going to admit in the future," one third of the overall acceptance posture was expressed.

The voice of Tiplic before the decisive battle against Australia
Justin Tiprick said, "I'm going to show you now."
If Wales won the Walladads, it would be the most hot winner of the Pool D, possibly the semi-final against France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, who has played 15 matches, wins 14 against Wales, Tiprick and his team will be one straight line with England.
"It's natural, I want to challenge both teams and win and end at the top of the group."
Until now, the fight against Australia had been severe, but it was good to win in the autumn of last year.
I think Australia will blame you very much for returning the loan, but until we do our best to win again.
I knew it was a mountain before I came here.
And I came here now, and now it's a real show.
Wales, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have won only one World Cup, and Wallad's victory is 32 years ago.
Under the supervision of Warren Gatland, the team's total score for the Southern Hemisphere weight class 3 team was only 7 in 41 rounds.
Wales stopped at 13 November Test Match Australia last year, but Tiprick included several representative members who won 9-6 of the match and was one of the players to play at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
He said, "It's hard to answer."
Indeed, the game was good, and maybe I thought that everyone would win, but I don't know well.
As a result, I scored about 15 points in the final game, so I seemed to have been much closer to the score than actually."
To win Wales, a combination of Australia, which is worshiped as Back Lo, Michael Hopper and David Pocock, and a breakdown battle with Tiprick are key.
Up until now, Tiprick has played 67 games in the international competition, and has experienced several matches and two players in the past and knows what is waiting for.
"They are definitely a global backs player," he says.
When you play against the background of the World Glass, you always know that you will be facing a tough match.
They are always at the highest level in the world.
I know exactly what kind of game will be.
Pocock is one of the world's best backs players in defensive battles, and Michael is one of the most aggressive backs in the world.
I want to fight with the best players in the world and increase myself, even though I'm not so strong.
If you want to fight with the best opponent and fight against the two, then you have to keep yourself up.
This Sunday doesn't mean the final level, but for us it's an important match for the World Cup.
the momentum is important.
If you continue to accumulate a good performance, you will be able to play a game that won't lose on the momentum.

If Yoshimoto Kogyo has 90 percent of the gala, would it be a gift from the performers?
A series of problems with Yoshimoto Kogyo, triggered by the dark sales of antisocial forces, have also been closed.
At the meeting on July 22, President Akihiko Okamoto said that the average "5:5 to 6:4" is that the company does not have any talent at 9.
If the ratio of "9:1" has 90% of Yoshimoto, the views of investors who are deemed to have gifts from comedians to Yoshimoto and are taxed are also flowing on Twitter, with more than 30,000 retweets.
If Galla's withdrawal was "9:1," would there be a donation tax?
He was asked by Yukinori ANDO.
In the first place, corporations are not subject to gift tax.
In any case, we will answer from the standpoint of tax.
Since Yoshimoto Kogyo is not an individual, it is not the subject of a gift tax in the first place.
In the case of "9:1," Yoshimoto Kogyo will earn a profit of ¥100 million in sales and ¥90 million in expenses.
This is subject to corporate tax.
Of course, you should have tax returns and already pay corporate taxes.
In addition, even if you are wondering about allocation, you don't argue that the amount you actually receive is different from the original amount.
And I think the amount you received will be declared as sales.
If the person who gave the gift is not aware of it, it would not be a gift if he was an individual.
If a transaction is made at a price that is clearly priced (e.g. buying and selling real estate) away from the original market for tax avoidance, it is a matter of calculating taxes.
However, as this time, a third party will not decide how much tax appropriate prices are for those who have traded without conflict.
Personally, I think one yen payment book is a poison.

the white house, the impeachment of the impeachment, a panic
The White House officials said on Thursday, that the new Democratic Party's impeachment pressure had been pushed forward, and that this week's "great panic" felt the lack of plans to address the emerging reality.
A person close to the White House said that the appeal of whistleblowers seems to have increased concerns, anxiety and concerns about the possibility of damaging the president and some peripherals.
He said, "I don't know what's happening."
The White House officials joked that there were no obvious plans for this situation, and that the normal measures that the president had made to do so far could not apply, and that this claim was so serious that there was no confidence in how to proceed, "It seems that the next news will be erased."
Another person who is familiar with this controversy expressed the atmosphere in the White House as "a state with a great shock" because the president would respond to the impeachment of the impeachment, and the possibility of becoming "aggressive."
Another concern is that during the impeachment interrogation, the pressure of the president is seen daily, and there are also close associates of the president who are considering acting "impulsive."
Trump has spurred concerns about the increasingly unpredictable behavior and the possibility of violent attacks by unexpected means and is concerned about President and Politics in the environment of the election year.
Trump faced the greatest threat that he had never seen before in his presidential term, and revived his strategy that he judged effective during the Russian investigation by Robert Morler, which led him to become an attacker and become a defense officer.
Trump tried to take a light look at the request of the Ukrainian president to cooperate with the investigation of the political enemies, disinteresting in the activities of the Democratic Party and the presidential candidate Joe Biden, and also attempted to undermine the credibility of the whistleblower as a motive for the factional conflict.
However, many White House officials have endured Morler's trials, but this time they began to feel the difference, and the close advisers said.
Although he was a brand president, he seemed to be attending a press conference on Wednesday, and he said he was familiar with the situation.
Trump enjoyed asking questions about Russia's alleged investigation, but it seems he was not in the heart of answering questions about Ukraine.
Some of the whistleblowers have identified the fact that President Trump, Vladimir Zellensky, and Ukrainian presidents did not have direct information on the call, which has been controversial, asserting that it is a fact that undermines the credibility of the whistleblower and are convinced that damage can be reduced.
Furthermore, when the president is attacked, the momentum of the support layer increases to defend against such facts.
However, a Republican strategic family, close to the White House, pointed out that the basic support rate of the president is already very high and the effect of impeaching new supporters would not be much.
In particular, if impeachment interferes with the legislative draft and monopolizes the news at around 4 o'clock, "There is no advantage to concentrate on the impeachment of the president for the next four months."
Another source of information said that those who argue that impeachment could help the President did not fully understand how the response of the President would be a deterministic factor.
Concerned White House officials seek advice to advisors to organize impeachment teams.
According to officials who explained the plan's bones, this initiative is still in the early stages, but it is still unclear what kind of initiatives such as the strategic decision room will be implemented.
However, this person said that it is necessary to have a clear leader who can organize public relations activities aggressively in order to counter the momentum that the publication of organizational legal strategies and communication strategies, and the publication of critical internal accusations to the impeachment of the Democratic Party.
According to more information about this situation, the lack of long-term strategic perspectives is clearly visible, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Finance Stephen Munshins, who expressed that they would not publish a note on the call with the Ukrainian president of Trump 48 hours later.
From the time of Robert Morler's investigation, who only spoke through the prosecution, is expected to increase further pressure.According to the person involved in this case, the person who may be involved in the impeachment deployment is called the external pitble of Trump, and Corrie Luwanduski, who served as the head of the former electoral headquarters.
However, Luwanduski told NBC News that it is not accurate to suggest that he would become a leader in such efforts.
"I've been doing everything I can to support the president and policy for the past five years, but I've never talked with the president or close adviser about participating in a team that counters this impeachment."
Trump's external attorney Jay Scorpor is also involved in impeachment efforts.
In an interview with NBC News, Scorp said, "The problem is properly handled."
The White House attorney Pat Ciporon, who was engaged in the impeachment of Clinton and led the White House until the end of the Moeller investigation, has little experience and the White House now lacks lawyers with experience of impeachment.
More information about the White House's strategy is generally recognized that officials are far from recruiting and building strategic teams, but are organized and needed to lead all the efforts to respond and political struggle.

A long distance romance must be prepared Only 16% success rate Tomoyoshi Morikawa - Yahoo! News
9/6 (Fri) 13:51
I was able to have a boyfriend, but because of his work, I love a distant love ...
I said, "Let's marry someday," but I can't see the goal and I can't see it.
So, what should we do to bring the situation together and connect to marriage?
Editorial I of Nikkei dors asked Professor Tomoyoshi Morikawa, who gave lectures on "love science" at Waseda University.
Prof. Morikawa's advice and reading from detailed data analysis.
this is my concern.
I'm worried about continuing my relationship with my boyfriend in distant love.
I want to continue living in Kansai, where my workplace and my family are.
Since it is a trading company, it is possible to transfer overseas.
It is said that "Let's get married in the future."
What should I do?
(23 years old, manufacturer, office)
A couple who got married from a distant love is a minority.
C is in love with a boyfriend for a year and a half.
There is also a word "to test the distance and the two will be strong," but in the first place, is the distance love going well?
Prof. Tomoyoshi Morikawa (hereinafter referred to as Morikawa) A survey conducted by DeNA Travel in August 2017 and 1147 people answered, but according to the data, only 16% of couples from distant love to marriage are known.
Since love is done using five senses, the relationship is deepened by seeing the opponent (visual), listening to the voice, connecting hands (touching), smelling (no smell), kissing (taste).
However, in the case of long distance love, there are cases where you can hear your voice by phone.
It may be difficult to keep working with hearing only situations.
There is also a cost problem.
If you go to your opponent's house, you will be burdened with time and effort, and your body is a holiday to heal your work fatigue.
When you return, you will feel comfortable.
Isn't it possible to break apart after a distance?
Morikawa If you are a couple who can endure even if you don't meet frequently, or a couple who are determined in advance, I think it will work well.

Devin Nunes accused the Democratic Party of the Trump nude photo request.
Senator Devin Nunes (California Republican) seems to be unable to bear the idea that President Donald Trump is investigating.
On Thursday, in a comment that defended the president, he accused the Democratic Party of attempting to obtain the presidential nude photo.
Members of the House Information Special Committee of the Republicans Nunes filed an appeal at the beginning of a hearing about the internal charges Trump requested to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The member accused the Democratic Party of wanting to see the President's naked photo, stating that Ukraine's suspicion was a "grotesque show" created by the leftist and media assets.
"The Democratic Party of the Special Committee negotiated with the Ukrainians to obtain Trump's nude photos."
Why is the Democratic Party so exciting to impeach the president?It's natural that everyone will ask for that opportunity within a year.
After the disproportionate of Nunes, a reporter from the Huff post, Jennifer Bendilly, decided to determine whether the Democratic Party is looking for the truth.
The response to this was only to the House of Representatives of the Democratic Party of Connecticut, but also to many other members, questioning whether the answer was a red naked truth.
Medire Dotcom speculates that Nunes' nude comments may be related to the "more detailed details of confirmation" that were written in steel documents that were discussed.
It is a notorious report collected by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele on Trump's shocking claims that in one of the hotels in Moscow, Trump is projected to see the urine of prostitutes, referring to the "Okko Tape" which suggests existence.
Origami, wallet and real card.
Transfer, Loan, Insurance and Investment - Yahoo! News
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to transfer money and transfer money through collaboration with financial institutions accounts in addition to payment by Origin Pay.
The charge function is also added.
Together with partner companies, they start financial services such as loans, investments, and insurance.
In other words, financial functions such as paying, moving, charging, borrowing, building, and preparing are available at Origin Wallet.
"We will create new financial services to solve the problems of young people who have to live with various problems such as pensions and low interest rates," said Masaki, President and CEO of Origami Financial Services.
The advantage of Origami Wallet is that if you have Origin ID, you will be able to complete seamlessly from application to transaction and get information in time.
In addition, he explained that by deploying the Origami app not only on the Origami app but also on the Partner Enterprise app, it would be possible to provide services that are available without having the Origin app.
In terms of financing, we introduce functions that can be used to pay after payment in conjunction with payment.
In addition, when the funds were suddenly needed, the Origami app was completed from application to repayment.
In terms of insurance, he introduced his first life as a partner.
The two companies will use their data and knowledge to develop insurance products in line with life events.
The provision of financial services is expected to start and expand gradually through registration of necessary administrative agencies.
New business for effective use of data
On the same day, Origami announced that companies will launch new businesses that support effective utilization of data, including data owned by companies, in addition to digitizing customer contacts by their Pay due to the payment function provided by Origami.
In partner companies that partner with Origami and payment functions, Origami recognizes that effective utilization of data is becoming a challenge, such as acquisition of structured data such as sales and unstructured data in real society, accumulation, processing and analysis of data.
In this context, Origami Technologies supports the acquisition and analysis of non-structured data, along with their payment data and structured data owned by affiliated companies.
It will contribute to the creation and transformation of new business models using digital technology and data.
Mr. Yoshiki Yasui, President and CEO of Origami, said, "Now many companies collect various data and make customer contacts," and explained, "In the next phase, how to use data to develop business models is key."
"We want to create next phase innovation by combining data built on the Origin Network and data from many companies."
Details of specific services will be announced sequentially.
In addition, the Origami Conference 2019 will provide the convenience of mobile technology, such as delivering coupons to smartphones when rain falls.
In addition, Oligami Pay is now fully compensated for compensation for unauthorized use, but it is clearly defined as a system in terms of use.
In addition, he expressed his intention to work together with the Tourism Association to promote regional revitalization.
The event was held in Awena Osaka, Osaka City on September 7 to commemorate the singer Mitoko Ogasawara who died at the age of 100 in July this year.
the people involved in the show
About 140 people from Japan participated, including Mr. Nagamasa, chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Headquarters, and Mr. Yukie Ikebe, chairman of the Japan-Korea Music Exchange Association.
In the ceremony, Mr. Yukie IKEBE greeted me.
Mr. Ikebe said, "I still can't believe that the teacher passed away."While preparing for "Remembers," Ms. Mitsuko Ogasawara felt that he felt how wonderful and great he was."
On the other hand, he said, "If you can do activities that can expand your meeting even a little," he said.
After being dedicated to silence, Messse-ji, who was sent by Mr. Kenichi Onoe, Director General of the Korea Arts Exchange Association and the International Institute of Chuchu thought, was introduced.
in renewable biofuel research
In recent years, although electric vehicles, Tesla trucks, and Semi have monopolized the news, it is the only flight to fly in the sky, and it is said that renewable energy is not available.
However, the University of Alberta developed a technology to use renewable biofuels as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, Professor of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Alberta, launched the project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory has developed hydrocarbon fuel from lipid waste such as fat, livestock rendering, and canopy oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology allows low-quality fats to be used for production, while carbon emissions are less than 85% lower than crude oil-based fuels.
This technology also acts as a reproduction of hydrocarbons present in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "This technology achieved in the first generation is a hydrocarbon of the molecules themselves in diesel gasoline."
Although it is a new option to use biofuels, conventional biofuel technology tends to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems in aircraft moving high altitudes.
"The problem of jet fuel is like a dilemma," said Bresler.
There is no value as diesel, but there is a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's laboratory currently focuses on two options: biofuel for jets.
The first is a low risk approach, which requires different processing of hydrocarbon biofuels to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue researching chemical reactions that maintain fuel stability even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "You can try nuclear reactors to change chemical reactions a little."
This option is risky.
With airlines, Canada and the U.S. Army investing in renewable options, Forbes Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of Alberta University, is working on commercialization.
"They expect someone to impose carbon tax in the future."
I would like to prepare for the worst case.
Forge currently operates a test plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center, and recently invested $400 million from Lockheed Martin as a support to build 2500 million production facilities in Sonbra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 1900 million liters of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler said that carbon reduction is about 85%, but the reduction rate is not higher for fuel transport and production.
"As a technical store," says Bresler.
My job is to create an option so that you can make multiple choices in parallel with the decision you have explained.

Boris Johnson warns that Britain faces riots like Los Angeles when Brexit is over.
One senior minister said last night that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there was a danger that "the violent riots by the people" would occur in this country.
The high officials of the prime minister warned the British would face the yellow best movement in France over economic inequality and the civil riots of the Los Angeles riots in 1992.
Johnson stated that it was necessary to "teach anger" against political words exchanged with intense speech, but insisted that he would not stop using the word "default."
Despite the appeal of the Prime Minister to regain his calmness, one cabinet said to the Times: "In this country, there has never been something like the Girre Joene or the Los Angeles riot in 1992.
The people do not think that riots will not occur in this country just because they have never happened before.
There's already a yellow best movement - they're encrypting mobile phones and organizing demonstrations, and then a few populist leaders who use dirty hands to drive people.
In Los Angeles, a riot occurred in 1992 when four white policemen who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King complained that the jury was innocent.
In the beginning of this year, the French anti-government demonstrators with the eye-catching yellow vests have caused confusion and destruction in the city of Paris over six weeks.
The Ministers pointed out Johnson's warning in the House of Representatives, stating that if the British failed to withdraw from the EU, "the credibility of Japan's political system would be catastrophically lost."
"If 30 million people voted in a referendum and 66% voted to stay in the EU, the 100 million people would be frustrated."
Even if 99 percent of voters opposed the withdrawal, 100,000 people who were very angry would not give up writing letters to Congress.
It doesn't take much time until tens of thousands of people go through the streets.
One senior minister added that if the second referendum overturned the first outcome, there would be a danger that "strong riots by the people" would occur in this country.
Johnson wants to make a general election and leave Brexit decisions to voters.
Johnson is reported to be facing a rebellion in the House of Representatives seeking to lower the demands on the withdrawal of the EU and instead beat the EU in a compromise.

Pakistani social media celebrity brother, a lifetime sentence
Women's rights experts say that the procedure is often prolonged and it takes time to execute the sentence, while the accused murderer is bailed and the memory of the incident is reduced.
"Because it takes too long, people forget" women's rights activist Farzana Bali, the founder of the first gender department at the University of Pakistan, added that it took more than three years to solve even the burrought incident that attracted attention.
Although human rights organizations say it is difficult to prove reliable data, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "religious murders" in 2018.
Many human rights advocates say that the number of actual honorable homicides is much more than that, but it is estimated that approximately one-fifth of the 5,000 honorary homicides occurring every year around the world are occupied by Pakistan.
Pork cholera measures 1.3 billion yen To add to the September correction plan in Shizuoka Prefecture - Yahoo! News
It was reported that the prefectural government would add 1,3600 million yen to the Diet's Executive Committee on September 26 that it would add 1,4800 million yen to the decision-making cost required to acquire land on the elevated JR Numazu Station.

Floods by monsoons in India and many other regions
The Monsoon season in India is about a month long, an unprecedented rainfall caused by buildings collapsed and many of the crops began to rot.
Usually, Monsoon in northern India weakens its forces at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month is 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this situation continues a few days later, Monsoon will weaken in the late decades.
In many parts of India, there is still an unprecedented rain, and the latest news is that the buildings collapsed due to heavy rains on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
The house was flooded and the inhabitants crossed the street with water to kneel, and it is usually seen only at the peak of Monsoon.
Other cities such as Corkata, Laguna and Hyderabad also suffered heavy rain.
In the northern province of Uttatarakand, heavy damage to houses caused by prolonged rain.
The arrival of Monsoon was too late.
Water shortages in many areas, farmers were preparing for the possibility of drought.
The long-running monsoons for farmers are not desirable.
This rainfall is not uncommon during this period.
Prakash Mehera, a small farmer in Bimtal, Uttarakand, said, "We are making cabbage, beans, peas, tomatoes, but vegetables are rotting in rain."
For consumers, the price of onions that cannot be used in Indian cuisine will rise due to the slow and weak Monsoon.
In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, 20 rupees per kilogram (23 pens) onion is usually sold at 80 rupees.
The festival is also under threat.
The next big festival is Dašera on October 8, and the Hindus set up the Ravana, a man of evil smiles of the beard that appears in the giant comic book-style doll, epic "Lamaryana."
The burning of Ravana means that good destroys evil.
However, since the dolls are made of paper, if Monsoon is pulled long, then the last laugh may be Lavana.

Exposure to a large amount of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack
The latest research shows that working around high concentrations of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease later.
This was the result of a tracking survey of Japanese Americans living in Hawaii for over 30 years.
Compared to a group of men who did not work around pesticides, researchers found that the risk of heart disease and heart attack increased by 45 percent.
"The emphasis on this research is the importance of wearing personal protective gears when exposed to pesticides in work, describing the presence of pesticide exposure in work in medical records, and reducing the standard risk factors of heart disease."
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of elderly medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
This is the result of research on data collected from more than 6,000 men living in Oahu, who participated in the Kakini Honolulu Heart Program.
Researchers have stated that this study may not be applied to women and other races because only Japanese Americans are targeting.
Since pesticides have a long half-life, health effects may appear after years of exposure.
The study showed the greatest impact within ten years after exposure.
"As a result of 34 years of tracking, the relationship between exposure of pesticides in work and heart disease and heart attack is no longer important," Dr. Rodriguez said in the press.
This is probably due to the increasing importance of other factors related to aging, which hides possible relationships between pesticides and mental disorders in his later years.
Researchers found that exposure to low and moderate pesticides, heart disease, and heart attack are not important.
Zerrensky: Poloshenko intervention at the Trump telephone meeting
The impeachment procedure for President Donald Trump was made, and the Washington political issue was a dramatic week.
I wanted to avoid being swallowed by political scandals for political beginners Vladimir Zellensky.
But what has happened to the Zellensky Trump phone problem so far?
At the very beginning of the telephone talks, Trump told Zellensky that the U.S. is more convenient to Ukraine than other European countries.
Although the call records published by the White House are not repeated, it is described in detail that Trump criticized the fact that Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders were devoted to speaking more than concrete proposals.
The response of Zellensky, who opposed Trump 100% rather than 1000 percent, is considered controversial.
Zellensky added that Macron and Merkel both did not fully support Ukraine.
Inspired by this conversation, politicians, especially Ukrainian opposition parties discussed on social media.
Former Ukrainian president Petro Poloshenko wrote on Twitter that "there is no precedent for assistance received from the EU."
In addition, Poroshenko tweeted that he thanked the EU's sanctions and economic assistance during the Russian invasion.
Some Ukrainian politicians, Victoria Voivoticica, expressed concern, saying, "Is it possible to negotiate again with Germany and France?"
Following Trump's request for military assistance and two investigations, not one, to Zellensky, the first is to suggest Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second is to investigate the servers of the hacked Democratic National Committee, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the Democratic e-mail in the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this would interfere with European relations or lay a backwater line against French and German leaders.
I don't want to tell anyone about it.
"I am grateful to those who support the announcement of the call record," Zerensky said at the New York General Assembly.
Zellensky will meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the Normandy 4 Summit scheduled in October.

CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana baying operations in San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte (BSLA) - Police closed illegal marijuana baying activities in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After the police executed a search warrant at 4:37 p.m. on suspicion of selling illegal marijuana pens, a large container of botan honey oil (rich cannabis oil) was found at office buildings located in 9600 blocks of Telstar Street.
Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police said that the investigators also found equipment packed with bayp cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," he said.
In the process of extracting oil used for Bayp products, he said that it could be a fire.
"The static electricity from clothes can only be ignited and concentrated, so it will cause not only fires but also explosions," he said.
In addition, if there are multiple containers like A, it could cause explosions and fire, as well as the entire building to be blown away.
The danger disposal team was summoned to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous substances.
The prices of seized goods and equipment were not immediately published.
He received an anonymous information and told the investigators that it led to an investigation warrant that found illegal activities.
The investigators are still pursuing who is the black curtain of illegal Bayp activities.
The police said that the office was empty, so Zhang himself thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police stated that, in particular, they would like to receive recent news related to the dangers of bating, tend to be illegal sleeping products and not go out.
"It's really a real thing or something you're buying without knowing."
Products may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may have caused great harm to our communities and children, so police always warn people not to approach these activities.

Three years after Lin accidentally found this luxurious cloth used as the altarpiece of the church in Bactton, Helefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be exhibited at the Hampton Court Palace next month, near exactly that room where Queen Tudor could wear more than 450 years ago.
Other than the rest of the 16th century dress, it is found that the entire Royal dress collection was an important discovery.
Although there is no perfect evidence for Elizabeth's dress through the sleeves, the three-year study led to the conviction of the expert that the dress was not in the possession of the royal family.
An expensive textile called "Gin thread cloth" was prepared by law only among the senior members of the royal family, but it also suggests that the pattern of deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears added later was noble.
At the time the dress was made, it seems that it was a price equivalent to one of the Tudor mansions.
In addition, in the 1590s at the end of the Elizabethan period, it is speculated that the Queen would be increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or that the rival wearing such luxurious clothing would not endure.
Mr. Lin said it was important to announce that he also came to see his colleagues.
I'm always happy to hear that when I look at the cloth, I'm sure they're looking at one of the royal dresses."
A long second life of a dress used as an altarpiece of the Holy Face Church of Bactton, cut off and unmarked, seems unexpected, but not so.
Bactton is a village from Brunswick Parley, who served as a female officer throughout Queen Elizabeth's long life.
Although the dress dates back to 1590, the expert believes that before Elizabeth died in 1603, it must have been brought to the family or church as a memorial to Paley.
Over 1,000 hours of repair, of which 400 hours are specially dyed silk and a very delicate hand sewn altar cloth will be displayed next to Elizabeth's portrait, one of the most admired contemporary paintings borrowed from Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The vast space as much as possible to store some of the very expensive tapestries is only a renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court grounds, and the preservation work is done almost here, and Libby Thompson, who taught the work, said, "When dealing with historical cloths, I feel really respect for the craftsmanship of those who made it."
When you look at the embroidered embroidery on the front and back, you will be very respectful to those who made this.
I have never seen such sophisticated works before.
Elizabeth's lost dress exhibition will be held at Hampton Court Palace from October 12.
"The scope of the request has been searched for" A week after the missing female child, the Self-Defense Forces withdrew and the volunteer men are missing (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo! News
It's a week since the first year of elementary school girls are missing at the campground in Michishi Village, Yamanashi Prefecture.
On the 28th, the Self-Defense Forces closed the search and withdrew.
The search for Ogura Misaki, a first-year student in Narita City, Chiba Prefecture, began at 6 a.m., about 240 people including police and SDF.
However, the village requested to withdraw from the SDF as "the scope of the request was searched," and the search for the SDF ended at noon.
From 25 to 4 days, the Self-Defense Forces deployed 650 people, mainly on the slopes of the mountains and places of danger such as Sawa.
On the 27th, there was no way to find a 20-year-old man who participated in the search by volunteers.
Police and fire are planning to continue searching from 6:30 am on 29th.
First oral speech, Miyazaki (MRT Miyazaki Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first oral speech of the trial was held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, and the immediate appeal was made.
In response to the appeal, the Plaintiff appealed for the election invalidation as compared to Fukui Prefecture, where the number of voters per member is the lowest in the country in July this year.
In the first oral statement held at the Miyazaki branch of Fukuoka High Court, the plaintiff claimed that "the value of one vote was inequality and constitutionality."
On the other hand, the defendant's prefectural election manager asked for a rejection of the bill as "it should not be said that there was a significant inequalities in which the issue of constitutionality arises, but it should be constitutional."
The judgment is passed on October 30.
The meeting was held by representatives of the delegation.

he's involved in a third of the american drugs
Shortly after the Chicago West Side sunrise, CBS News captured the rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McNight of the Drug Control Department (DEA) revealed what was going on in white daylight.
Nearly 800 people died in Chicago last year in excess of drugs.
McNight said that 90% of the drugs taken in Chicago were brought from Mexico.
DEA, commonly known as El Mencho, focuses on Mexican drug king Nemecio Servantes.
The Mexican agent Matthew DonahewDEA said, "Mencho is DEA and indeed the top priority of the Federal Law Enforcement Agency."
El Mencho's prize money reaches $1 million.
With the help of Donahhe, dozens of drug manufacturing sites in the dense forest were violent.
El Mencho's drug cartel, Harrisko Nueva, is involved in at least one third of drugs brought to the United States on land and sea routes.
According to the Ministry of Justice, Cartel sold "a large amount of cocaine, methane fetamine, and fenthanyl mixed heroin."
El Mencho's neck was awarded $1,000.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and sent back to Mexico.
He started a violent drug cartels.
He owns a large amount of weapons, carrying rockets, and 50 calibers.
In fact, Donahhe said he owns his own special maneuver.
From the death of six Mexican Army helicopters to the involvement of public executions in the summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders occurred due to drug trafficking.
According to the Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders occurred a day.
In Chicago, the seized Mexican drug is toxic, so it is necessary to wear protective clothing when handling.
At the manufacturing base, the seal of the solder is pressed in the bag of cocaine.
More than one third is thought to be made by El Mencho's drug cartels.
Donahhe said, "Mencho is involved in the influx of harmful substances that virtually take away the lives of innocent women and children."
In other words, when someone's child dies, Donahhe said that it is "probably" drug brought from El Mencho's organization.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.

Tenoji Zoo (Tennoji Ward, Osaka City) opened a farewell party in Osaka Prefecture on the 28th.
In mid-October, a 10-year loan to the British zoo was decided, and it is likely that he would not return.
thank you.
About 600 visitors gathered in front of the core building, which is rich in eucalyptus.
He is 12 years old.
Corea's life expectancy is 15 to 20 years, and it is thought that he will be full of Tenju in the UK, where he was married.
Mr. Eiki Tsujimoto (40) in charge said, "I can't cut down the curtain to keep Corela alive, and I am filled with gratitude."
Sony, Playstation 4 surprise news, PS4 game was a long time ago.
Sony revealed the PS4 limited edition of the Last of Part 2.
As part of the recent state of play announcement, Sony announced the release date of February 2020, the sequel to Last of As.
Some of the video footage of this new action game was presented to fans.
A few days after the Last of As2 announcement, more details were announced.
Sony and Norty Dog seem to return to the wind in various ways.
Since the time of PSwan, the last of the two parts have been released on multiple discs.
In a great interview with Telegraph, Notydog Neil Drackman announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the biggest games ever.
"In a different sense from the previous work, the story is magnificent and complex."
And it was necessary to talk about the story of many characters like this.
He did not intend to make the biggest game in history, but eventually evolved.
"I was excited about how this story unfolds, and the user felt the end, but in fact it was the beginning and realized that all other sections started."
The game did not go into a single blue ray, making it two discs.
In addition, the Last of As Part 2 includes one or two bad Easter eggs (via Gamespot) that are open at work.
Although it does not ruin this surprise, Easter Eggs in the game include nostalgic notic dog works.
When the Last of As Part 2 was released on February 21, 2020 limited to PS4, you will see a lot more.
Those who have PS4 should pick up the last of the remastered with PS Plus and prepare for the release of the sequel.
Sony recently released the PlayStation Plus free PS4 game in October 2019, including the aforementioned Notic Dogs.
The MLB The Show 19 was released in October for PS Plus members.
If you like the Last of As Remasterd and want to book the sequel ahead, Sony has already announced several versions of the game, including the popular character Erie backpack and bracelet replica, and a bonus version with 12 inch figures.
Notoshima's mobile sales "help" council attempts Residents wish to continue - Yahoo! News
On the 26th of Notoshima Island in Nanao City, where the number of shops decreased, the movement sales started by the Notoshima Regional Development Council.
During the trial until December, wagon cars with daily necessities, seasonings, and food went through the Susomachikai and the Hanpomachikai on the first day.
Some of the products that were sold more than expected were quickly added, and the residents asked them to continue saying, "I am happy to choose goods."
There were 110 wagons, including total vegetables, municipal garbage bags and detergents.
A total of vegetables such as potato salads and kippigobo are lined up at 100 yen and affordable prices so that the elderly can eat even if they live alone.
At the Susomachi-kai, people's columns were built, and salt and sugar were sold out.
Akira Kikuchi of the Council said, "I didn't expect to sell so much."
Mr. Mizue Harada (83) of Suso-cho, Notoshima, who is usually shopping with his husband's driving, said, "I don't know when my father can drive, and I hope he will continue."
The user also received orders such as "I want you to bring coffee to your own, not canned coffee."
The council will consider the products that were requested.
On Noto Island, there are only one convenience store where you can buy daily necessities, and the council tried to sell them to save "shop weak."
By December, the 20-machi-kai in the island will go around once a month and consider whether it will continue as a business after the next fiscal year.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that the drought-stricken residents decided to add about $1 billion.
The cash support policy for farmers affected by droughts has been extended, and existing farm allowances are greatly reviewed for simplicity.
In addition, approximately $34 million will be recorded as a drought-affected resident support organization, and the target farmers will receive emergency assistance of up to $3,000.
As a subsidy program for drought-affected areas, up to 13 municipalities will be assisted by a total of $1 billion for infrastructure development and drought-related measures.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already recorded a budget of more than $70 billion as a drought support.
Ronald Lee Haskell: charges for murder of a former wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Hasskel (39) was convicted in Spring, Texas in 2014, killing Stephen and Katie Stay and four of his five children.
The authorities stated on July 9, 2014 that he was pushed into the house of Stay and questioned the location of his wife Melanie Haskel.
Melanie was absent, but her sister, Katie Stay and her family were there.
Huskel fired, and Harris County Police Department reported that Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13-year-old and four-year-old son, nine-year-old and seven-year-old daughter died.
In his family, only one person, Cassidy Stay, was 15 years old at that time.
At that time, the authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but then recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously dismissed allegations of innocence by Ronald Lee Haskel's heart loss.
The jury was dismissed from the charges until Monday.
"If you choose to disappoint us, never forgive us."
I wonder if the appeal of a girl who shook the voice of anger resonated with each other's leaders.
Global warming is becoming more serious.
At the UN Climate Action Summit in New York City, Swedish 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg gave a speech to strengthen measures.
For example, he boycotted classes and sat in front of Congress, and became a fireman to spread the school strike around the world.
Young people who raised anxiety and anxiety protested all over the world, including Japan.
Approximately 4 million people participated in more than 150 countries.
Morioka also marched with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework launched in 2020, aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by virtually zero in the second half of the century and to reduce the temperature rise to less than twice before the Industrial Revolution.
We will take measures set by all participating countries without distinction between developed countries and developing countries.
However, abnormal weather, which is pointed out to be related to global warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rains, follows various places.
In order to improve global warming at a fast pace, one-step initiatives are required.
At the summit, which was realized by the call of Secretary-General Guterres of the United Nations to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries expressed their long-term goal to virtually zero by 50.
Other 70 countries raised their target for the immediate future.
On the other hand, in addition to the United States, which expressed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India did not explicitly express their new objectives, and the slowness of the movement of the emitters became apparent.
Japan's criticism of coal-fired power generation is also strong.
The government's long-term strategy sets zero emissions as early as possible in the latter half of the century, but the gap between countries aiming to "zero 50 years."
Japan had no opportunity to speak at the summit.
Mr. Shinjiro Koizumi, who presented Japan's initiatives at the environmental-related meeting, said at the meeting, "We should work on fun, cool, sexy."
The appeal does not deny, but it is too poor compared to the appeal of girls.
There is no opposition to Mr. Greta, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The wounds that cannot be discussed will not be included in the "replacement of issues" that the person counters.
The international community has to deal with the common crisis of mankind, with no exception to global warming measures.
There is no sufficient effectiveness for each country's efforts.
There are many young people and children behind Mr. Greta.
It is an adult who should act to avoid taking the future.
One step to realize quantum Internet -- Science Daily
The U.S. Army's research results led a step toward the realization of quantum Internet.
This Internet may be able to secure military safety, measure and measure time functions that were impossible for conventional network initiatives.
According to the U.S. Army Research Institute distributed quantum information center, which is funded by the Army Research Institute, the University of Innsbruck has achieved a record of quantum entangling transport between matter and light - 50 km from optical fiber cable.
Entanglement is a correlation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state and one is measured, even if the other quantum bits are physically far away, the other is affected by the measurement results.
"This distance [50 km] is two digits larger than the past, and it is a realistic distance to start building a intercity quantum network," says Dr. Ben Lañon, a experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck who published results in Nature's quantum information.
It is said that the intercity quantum network is composed of networks between physical quantum bits in entangles, despite the large distance.
Researchers say that the dispersion of this entanganglement is absolutely essential for the establishment of the quantum Internet.
"This proof is a big step to realize a large distributed engagement," says Sarah Gambling, deputy secretary of the Army program to support research.
Entanglement at exits passing through the fiber also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions required for some of the most difficult quantum networks.
The team began experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
Researchers used laser rays to write quantum states on ions, and then excited until quantum information was released.
As a result, quantum states of atoms and light particles became entangles.
The challenge is to transmit photons with optical fiber cables.
"The wavelength of the photon emitted from calcium ions is 854 nanometers, and it will soon be absorbed into the optical fiber cable," says Rañon.
The team then sent the light particles through a nonlinear crystal with strong laser irradiation.
The wavelength of photons was converted to 1550 nanometers, which is the standard wavelength for long-distance transfers.
Then the photon was sent through a fiber optic cable 50 km long.
In the measurement results, atoms and light particles remained entangled despite the long-range movement of wavelengths.
"The use of calcium atoms can capture calcium at the same time as a high-quality "clock" quantum bit, which leads to the realization of an entangled network in long-range atomic clocks.
The large Entangle watch network is a very important field for the Army from the perspective of accurate positioning, navigation, and time-consuming applications."
