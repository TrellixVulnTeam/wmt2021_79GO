driving at high heels is dangerous!
Yahoo! News
Traffic law violations
It's a big mistake to think that it's only a problem with older drivers.
According to the National Police Agency data (2015), more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or less, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
do you take your feet?
take safety?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that the young age group will be distracted by other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on their clothes, such as high heels, panps, sandals, and mulls.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think it's troublesome to change their shoes, but some people don't think about the possibility that they can lead to danger, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals is conflicting with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brake and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that "No driving should be made to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural government security committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, "I wear shoes in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle, such as wearing slippers, twisting, high heels, etc.
The aim of each prefecture is to consider a violation of driving in "the footwear that may interfere with driving operations" even if it is not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving in a high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedal operation safely.
For safe pedal operation, first place the foot or foot on the floor and place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right as the tip when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that the car does not feel comfortable.
However, because the height of the heel and the height of the heel are equal to the angle of the foot, the area of the foot on the pedal is smaller and the area of the foot is smaller, and the fine adjustment is difficult.
This can lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easily pulled by a heel or a heel, and when the heels are pulled, the pedals are not stepped, and the heels are removed from the heels and the heels are pulled into the back of the pedals.
In addition, there is a case where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The company was founded in June 1895 and incorporated in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a Ibushi tile maker in Nishizumi-cho, Mihara County (present-day Minami-Awaji City).
In October 1986, the merger of Kyowa Ceramic Industry Co., Ltd. and the business of Kinki Industry Co., Ltd. succeeded, while the main store was moved to its present location by changing its current name to the present name.
After that, sales bases were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was based on Ibushi tiles.However, due to changes in consumer needs, Western tiles such as flat plate tiles were produced at a rate of 70 percent, and Ibushi tiles were manufactured at a rate of 30%.

He was known as the top tile manufacturer of Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock during the period, and the subsequent damage to the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand was sluggish due to the increase in consumer roofs.

For this reason, financial institutions were trying to rebuild their business by asking for a easing of the repayment conditions for borrowings, but there was no signs of recovery in the business situation, and the financial situation gradually intensified.
I couldn't help but abandoned the business continuity and took this action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

What is beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu's work? - Yahoo! News
Is there anything in common with mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and in August 2019, "Baizu-no-O Girl Collection" (Genkosha), a collection of beautiful girls drawn by Baizuo, known as the first person in the horror manga, was launched.
If you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between beauty and fear of Baizu's work again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizuna works
In the Preface of the Beauty Collection, there was a statement saying, "There is a beauty of the women who are in extreme contrast to fear, uglyness, and the shocking scene and deployment of the story."
Although there is a keyword "sushi" that appears in many of Baizu's works, snakes can be seen as "a creepy creature" or people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, but others are not good at it.
Thus, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "evilness" may be a snake.
This creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" came to live is auspicious.
In the Baizu work about the snake, there are "Mama Kowai!" series of "Mama Kowai!" and "Later Girl."
It is the market for beautiful women with shadow.
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ...
Among them, Orochi, the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Orochi Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is the representative character of Baizu's work, but it is reminiscent of a snake somewhere in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

"The culprit" - Yahoo! News
"The Iranian drone "Aba Beer," which was used in this bombing, has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing the drones of the US military that crashed.
It is cheap and can be manufactured, with a distance of about 1,000 km.
It's also an advantage that it's hard to catch radars to fly low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, led by President Rohani, and Iran cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Sugawara, an international political analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock returns.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least the next year's election ends, as Trump has publicly set up a withdrawal from the Middle East, and Iran will continue to bomb drones on the hideout of the Fusi faction, and the U.S. will not be able to endure forever."
The United States and Iran's "signal war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber is a super personality?
I asked the president who hired me.
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is employed as regular employees in their company.
It is a direct marketing mix (DmMiX), a company that mainly operates CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Chairman and Representative Director of DmMiX, spoke to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is also the representative of the first subsidiary and staff of YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as "Kobayashi"): The occupation of YouTuber is now adored by many young people.
The top rankings for elementary school students are also in the vocational rankings that they want to start in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmans and comedians.
In the same way, "Youtuber adoption" is intended to encourage young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber is a reality that they are not able to generate revenue as they thought.
There are many creators who are making and posting videos while working part-time, and creators who are unable to recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide the environment for pay and content creation to the selected creators.
At first, we would like to support our activities by supporting the benefits of YouTuber's profession that will become unstable.

Momota won the World Championship and Zhou Tensei won the competition with Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic Games.
Momota also has JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May (May/China), Indonesia OP (July 16 strong), JapanOP (July), and the World Championship (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the wartime period.
There is a need for good results in the mid-term competition from September.
Ace in Taiwan, which is resistant to fighting.
Young Thai people are also interested!
Shutennari, who also won the top tournament of the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), has already competed in seven competitions.
In September, he joined the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a very strong player and does not suffer from fighting.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Although Zhou Tensei had an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, he was able to continue his good grades by increasing the stability of the play in this year.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be a tougher opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, he left the results in the first half of the match against the Thai young Ace Cantaphon and the Indian Cy Planet B.
He is the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who has been fighting for Europe.
Although Cantaphon does not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he won the top prize in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but it seems that the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who was able to rally against top players may have a great chance to leap in the Olympic Games.
Sy Praneys B. also took a step in India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranii H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been delayed due to injury, will also catch up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was introduced in October following the revision of the telecommunications business law.
However, it was generally stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for about 40% lower," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry of Rakuten will be forwarded and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a cost system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, it was set to increase communication fees.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make up and half the terminal.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes up to three-quarters of the terminal for only subscribers of the line.
The three companies continue to "enclose" to prevent transfer to other companies.
With regard to SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate release.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was due to the lack of progress in the development of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected that the price reduction competition would be explosives, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and price of the full-scale service is not clear.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
This revision led to the remarks by the Secretary of State Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to stay at all."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government prices will ease the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out of the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention as there were cases where consumer burdens exceeded half the amount, while the terminals were advertising such as "up to half the amount."
To avoid misunderstandings of users by companies themselves, we must try to explain politely and easy to understand.

U.S. FLkyle is a rough play, former English representative, "Don't call tackle."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan's final appearance in 20 countries was defeated in England by 7-45.
Although it became a black star, Lafplay, played by FLJohn Kyle in the latter half, called a ripple.
In the face of the opponent's face, he dropped out.
The media also released the actual scene with video, and former English athletes complained that "not to call tackles."
[Video] "It's insulting and cowardly play" and overseas crest!
A moment when the U.S. representative Kyle played a face-to-face risk tackle.
The fight was over.
It takes 29 minutes to pick up at 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy, the English commander Farrell fell in balance when he caught his side's pass.
I went to Tackle this was Kyle.
However, he had an upper body rather than a lower body from his waist, and he had a strong body in his upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other's head, and they are shaped like a head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
The British protested against the clear lack of legitimacy in the play.
Both players gathered at once and became air-conditioned.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out of the red card.
Bucks left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for a fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media staff is featured in the headlines: Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players dropped out of the game and England won the game.
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and was dropped."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Monja.
"It's an insult, it's a coward, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced on September 26 that it was the first hospital name of 424 that it judged that "the medical record was poor" among public hospitals such as 1455 public hospitals and JRCS hospitals nationwide.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the medical record of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were included: the National Hospital Organization of Wara City; the Three Kingdoms Hospital of Kusakai City; the Oda Hospital in Echizen-cho; and the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital in Kitahama-cho.
the standard is strange.
In order to reduce medical costs that are expanding due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to promote reorganisation and integration with hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital and decided to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety about the disappearance of a nearby hospital.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The hospital had a population of 29 and 1%, with a relatively small number of beds.
In prefectures, Niigata (53-7 percent), Hokkaido (48-6%), Miyagi (47-5%), Yamaguchi (46-7%) and Okayama (43-3%).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated the "Advanced acute phase" for patients with severe illnesses and 1455 hospitals that respond to the " acute phase" of general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and analyzed whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes of the car, and judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital is subject to consideration such as abolishing and transferring some medical departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the clustered families were 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in hospitals nationwide to 1191,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute" and " acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while there is a shortage in rehabilitation for elderly people.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
The area is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing, but many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote the revitalization of the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital that has little experience.

9 districts recommended for pork cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock-borne disease "Tann cholera" in order to prevent infection.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars are identified.
The movement of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccinations is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is accepted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and recognizing extraterritorial distributions such as meat, it is possible to eliminate the "clean country" certified by international organizations and influence the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended temporarily.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The prefecture will create a " vaccination program" that summarizes the scope of vaccination, time, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, have been raised as recommendations for vaccination.
The area is determined very once the guidelines are revised.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and extrusion are restricted to the region in principle.
For meat and processed goods, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is practically acceptable to distribute outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
He is also involved in the prevention of the damage caused by rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasures Headquarters.
In the future, the public comments and opinions of prefectures will be conducted until October 7, and new preventive guidelines will be implemented.

"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last year, he left Melbourne Victory in Australia's A League, and Keisuke MFONDA, a former member of the Australian A League, was in an amazing act.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the match?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "Please give us an offer, but you don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent a "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world-famous gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request for the Premier League club?
It was featured in the Australian edition FOX Sports, which was released 24 days later.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could grab in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonnie were the names of Honda.
Currently, the United has suffered injuries such as MF Pole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Martial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The "Red Devil" led by OrlÃ© Gunner Sulshirer, was forced to score 222 in the league and slip out of trouble, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
According to the article, "Instead of a striker, Honda's contract as a creative side player can fill holes filled by Andreas Perilla."
His 18-game score for Melbourne Victory was "hard record," but he pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to take full attention away from his entertainment management of Cambodian representatives."
Will the Honda approach be true?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move because of the veterans who will speak with their goals next year's Tokyo Olympics.

Ikemura Kanyo, who is Naodra's name now, doesn't need the first shot?
caddy's the best shot today.
The 1W shot is not always up and down.
For example, if you want to earn a distance in the second round of par5, you will want to hit the ball on the ground, and there is a technique called " Naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves risk of falling balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 he was 166 cm tall and is currently 7th in the driving direction category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
At the beginning of spring, "I thought I would try Naodra because I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W).
From the practice round to the top of the lawn in the Ti area, you can drop the ball with a pointer, and you can also swing 1W.
In a case where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but both sides make use of direct dora in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
The track record was 270 yd to 280 yd.
"So I don't need 3W.Caddy is more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood was only 1W in the Cady Bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
The battle method surprised by the tour companions is also happy to hear the feeling of leaking from the gallery.
The trick is to "play the club horizontally."
"Even if you hit the lower blow, you can't fly straight, even if you hit the upper, you're going to right with a cut track.It was originally a direct drag to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the time of tiup).
Although the ball does not catch and involves risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that I can't believe.

Weedge shot in Garcia
I thought it was possible to reach the momentum in the latter half because I was able to increase the momentum in the first half.
did you see the sixth eagle and seventh bardy win?
Even after I hit Boggy on the 4th, there was still a par 5.
But I was regrettable that I couldn't continue in the second half.
what did you get in this tournament?
I didn't feel good recently, so I was glad that Fairway was able to pick up even in a narrow course.
It was a course where roughness and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have much else to change, but since I was co-hosted by a small number of Japanese players, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to foreign players."
In the second half, we will continue to fight, but if we don't win more than one, we would like to win another so we can't aim for winning the prize.
What is the way to prevent dementia and keep things forgotten?
Interview: Fumi/WATANABE So
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Prof. Toshisuke Otsuki spoke to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference between mildness and severity, and everyone can become dementia after age.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug called Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and it is not expected that a significant recovery effect will be achieved.
On the other hand, the number of deaths caused by infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have been declining due to remarkable advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to create an environment that can live safely in the community as a whole.
How to keep things forgotten
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them as close as you forget.
dementia is considered one of the lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is considered one of the lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the U.S., there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in an environment that cannot be cooked in the first place can be used.
Then it becomes a meal with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and sugars.
In the end, it is poor but obese, and if you're going to do it, you'll have to look at the TV, and your body will be disabled.
Similar situations can also be in Japan.
In addition, people who don't think things or don't work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to read books from day to day and think about things.
