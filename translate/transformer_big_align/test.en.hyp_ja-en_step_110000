Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Yahoo! News
Traffic law violations
It is a big mistake to think that it is only a problem for elderly drivers.
The number of years-old pedal accident cases (2015 National Police Agency data) exceeded 1032 cases over 75 years of age, with more than 1080 cases less than 24 years old.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
do you take your feet?
take safety?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, there is a possibility that the young age group is distracted by other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes and drive them as they wear hiheel, panps, sandals, and mulls.
Some people know that it's not suitable for driving, but some people think it's troublesome to change their shoes, but some people don't think it's possible that they can lead to danger, and many people are driving bad.
However, driving in high heels and sandals is in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brake and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that "Do not drive to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture.
The aim of each prefecture is to consider a violation of driving in footwear that may interfere with driving operations, even if not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For secure pedal operation, first place the foot or foot on the floor, then place the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not break the car.
However, because the height of the heels and the angle of the foot are always at the same height as the heels, the area of the foot on the pedal is smaller and the area of the foot is smaller, making it difficult to step firmly.
This can lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get rid of whether it is a high heel or not, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal is not stepped, or the heel is removed from the heels and the heel is pulled away.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls back to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

The season started with 31 games, losing 6 wins and 398 defenses, but threw 178 2/3s and 229 sacks.
In particular, in the second half of the game, the ball form was stable, and he continued to play against the opponent with outstanding ball force and overwhelming ball strength.
"Now I'm definitely not going to make a difference in my life, but at the age of 33 I didn't think it would be such a feeling.In spring, I thought "I'm going to finish doing this too," but from there I feel that I can't believe myself that I can go to a better place."
From early June, I was gradually able to understand the response.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased and we can do one day more."
It was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypothesis itself one after another, it became more and more successful.
He also became confident that he was thrown into the injured list throughout the year.

The final conclusion is not, but the feeling is firm.

"Aba Beer, a Iranian drone used in this bombing, has dramatically improved performance by analyzing drones from the US military that crashed in recent years.
It is cheap and can be manufactured, and its length is about 1000 km.
It's also an advantage that it's hard to catch radars to fly low air."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization "Fusi-ha" announced the crime statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, led by President Rohani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Mr. Sugawara, International Political Analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock returns.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until Trump's withdrawal from the Middle East, at least until the next year's election ends," said Mr. Sugawara.After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the hideout of the Fusi faction, but the United States will not be able to endure forever.
The U.S. and Iran's "substitutional war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, some companies have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is employed as regular employees in their company.
Direct marketing mix (DmMiX), which is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, President and CEO of DmiX, who is also the representative of the company and staff first that YouTuber has adopted.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Today, YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are also on top of their career rankings that they want to be in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, "Youtuber adoption" is intended to encourage young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, most YouTuber have a reality that they don't have a profit as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and creators who do not recognize their family as YouTuber.
This initiative provides the environment for pay and content creation to selected creators.
At first, we would like to support the benefits of YouTuber's profession that would become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Assistant Secretary of State for the United States - Yahoo! News
Napper, Assistant Secretary of State for the United States, said on November 27 that he would like to reconsider and return Korea's decision to destroy Japan and Korea's military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA), which will expire on November 23 at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to reconsidering the destruction of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information and other information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper asserts that no GSOMIA can respond effectively to the crisis.
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted over the Sea of Japan in July also marked the threat of "the first time in history."
The recent deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea has been pointed out to be "damaged by US national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and South Korea will play a positive role to fill apart."

Even after the tournament, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Although Zhou Tensei had an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, he was able to continue his good grades by increasing the stability of the play this year.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be a tougher opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, he left the results in the first half of the match against the Thai young Ace Cantaphone and the Indian Cy Planet B.
He is also the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who has been struggling for Europe.
Although Cantaphone does not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he won the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21 years old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a huge potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Sy Praneys B. also took a step in India, where players from singles were good.
Samir Balama, Prano H.S., and Sliccans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will catch up in the future, so attention should be paid to the Indian forces after the mid-term battle.
New charges for mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was launched in October following the revision of the telecommunications business law.
However, it was generally stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for less than 40%," and despite the high expectations for lower prices, prices did not rise.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been forwarded and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a cost system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminals, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make up and half the terminal.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to three-thirds of the terminal size for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfer to other companies.
As for SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) announced that it would require immediate termination.
The company must respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
He was expected to be a detonator of low-price competition, so he was wearing a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and prices of full-scale services are not revealed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
This revision led to the remarks by the Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to remain."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government prices will ease the market and encourage healthy competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before it is out of the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention as there were cases where consumers were more than half the burden of consumers, although the terminals were advertising such as "maximum half."
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, companies must try to explain politely and easily.

U.S. FLkyle is a rough play, former English representative, not a tackle.
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan's final appearance in 20 countries took place on 26 June, and the United States finished 7-45 in England.
It was a black star, but the late Lafplay played by FLJohn Quill called a ripple.
He then leaves in a way to add a shoulder tack to his face.
The actual scene was released by foreign media and video, and former English athletes complained that "not to be called tackle."
[Video] "It's insulting and inferior play" and overseas ripple!
A moment when the U.S. representative Kyle played a face-to-face risk tackle
A hot fight broke out.
It is 29 minutes later that I received at 0-38.
In an attempt to capture the enemy's path, the English general Farrell had a balance.
I went to Tackle this was Kyle.
However, he raised his upper body not from his waist but from his waist to his upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other, and they are shaped like a head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
The English protested against a clear lack of legitimacy in the play.
Both players gathered at once and became air-conditioned.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out of the red card.
Bates later pitched with a bad face, but some of the audience who sought a fair play were heard.
The local media staff of New Zealand, a strong rugby union player, is featured in the headlines: Rugby World Cup 2019: The U.S. player leaves in a poor play and England wins.
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Moña.
"It's an insult, and it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first 424 hospital names to be found in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Japan Red.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were included: the National Hospital Organization of Wara City; the Three Kingdom Hospitals of the Three Kingdoms; the Oda Hospital in Echizen-cho; the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "standards are strange."
In order to reduce medical costs, which are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate hospitals in competing areas.
In October, he requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital and decided to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety about the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
It was announced at the same time.
The total hospital was 29.1%, with a relatively small number of beds.
In prefectures, Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals for "high acute phase" for severe patients and " acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, he judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the mass-produced children were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set the goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 1191,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute" and " acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a shortage in rehabilitation for elderly people.
To cope with aging, the number of beds should not only be reduced, but also increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical professionals are discussing, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital that has little experience.

9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of pig cholera, an infectious disease in livestock, which is not currently recognized.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The movement of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccinations is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted outside the region.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is unlikely to be a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture creates a vaccine vaccination program that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed, and receives confirmation of the province and allows use by the governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, have been proposed for vaccination.
When the guidelines were revised, the region decided very much.
The movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and omissions is restricted to the region in principle.
For meat and processed goods, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
He appealed for the safety of pigs inoculated, and was also involved in preventing rumors.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized at the meeting of experts held the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasures Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments from prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is an open approach to Manu!
Don't need money ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the A League of Australia, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, was surprisingly active.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, said, "We don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world's leading gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request for the Premier League's most powerful club?
It was featured in the Australian edition FOX Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could grab in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was named.
At present, injuries such as MFpole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford are in emergency.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Sulscherl, was forced to play in the league with 22 wins and 22 tough slips, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, it is analyzed that Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill holes filled by Andreas Perilla.
He scored 9 goals in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory, but noted that "The 33-year-old Honda must leave his entertainment to manage Cambodian representatives and attract full attention."
What is the approach of Honda?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move because of the veterans who will speak publicly about the goals of the next year's Tokyo Olympics.

The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on June 26 that it had completed a total of 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is said that it will be the first time in Japan to deploy the translation machine in the same region, and it will be noted that it will lead to improved inbound response capacity.
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134.
The city has 60% of its population.

Ikemura Kanyo, who is Naodra's name now, doesn't need to raise his first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
The 1W shot is not always tiring.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique that you want to make a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance in the second round of par 5.
A recent 1W, due to its large head volume, involves risk of losing the ball, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24, he was 166 cm tall and is currently 7th in the driving direction category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
At the beginning of spring, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodra."
You can drop the ball from the practice round to the top of the lawn in the Ti area, and you can also sprinkle 1W.
In a case where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but it is effective to use Naodora in a narrow hall with both sides.
You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"So I don't need 3W.Cardy is more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cady Bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
I'm also happy to hear the words of lamenting leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"But even if I hit the top, I can't fly straight.It's a cut track, and I'm going right.I used to do a direct drag to correct the swinging of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
Although the ball does not catch and involves risk of slices, "So the left side can be removed (not bent to the left).
Cantan says ... but it's a professional skill that I can't imagine.

Greta Tonbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Mr. Greta Tunberg, Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Tonbeli: Why are the people laughing and threatening their children?
A political critic told Greta about his American television show, "It's mentally ill, and it's used by parents and international leftists."
In Japan, on the Internet, there are many reports on Greta's comments, such as "It is used and cute" and "It is better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on Twitter, saying, "Why do people use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children?"
i'm going to think about as long as i can think about lies and conspiracy theories.
Mr. Greta said, "As you notice, the people who hate me are still active.My appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and I follow different places with people, and they start to think about as long as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that they did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to have problems with the story.
I don't understand why they use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I wonder if they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to awaken.
It has changed.
Many people like that change, but they don't like it.

It was a course where the rough and the reverse were separated and the distance was changed.

It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but the gallery was filming videos.
Other than that, I didn't have much changed, but just co-hosted a competition where there were fewer Japanese players, so I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to overseas players."
We will continue in the second half of the game, but we don't want to win more than one win so we don't want to win another.

Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenge R&D and are frustrated with dementia drugs.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated, and it seems that it is possible to remain extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Prof. Toshisuke OTSUKI talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a difference in degree.
However, it is still considered to take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug called Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and it is not expected that the outstanding completion effect will be achieved.
On the other hand, the number of deaths caused by infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have been decreasing due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve it by yourself or family, but it is necessary to create an environment where society can live with peace of mind as a whole.
how to keep things forgotten
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and keep them at the level of forgetting things.
dementia is considered one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be easy to get.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is perceived as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence and absence of economic power.
For example, in the U.S., there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used first.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life of fat and sugar.
In the end, it is poverty but obesity, and if you want to do it, you can only see the TV in a blur, and your body is disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to read books from day to day and think about things.
