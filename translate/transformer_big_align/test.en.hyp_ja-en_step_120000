Driving in high heels is dangerous!
The accident caused by the mistake of pedaling young people - Yahoo! News
violation of road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that it is only a matter of elderly drivers.
According to data from the National Police Agency (2015), more than 1080 cases were under 24 years old and more than 1032 cases over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
do you take your feet?
take safety?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, there is a possibility that the young age group is distracted by other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, some women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, panps, sandals and mulls, and drive them as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people are troublesome to change their shoes, but some people do not think of the possibility that they can lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, driving on high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brake and other operations, and Article 70 of the Act stipulates that "No driving should be done to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, "Don't drive a vehicle (except a light vehicle) in a way that prevents the driver from wearing or preventing any other footwear that hinders the operation.
The aim of each prefecture is to consider a violation of the operation of "a footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if it is not stated as "high heels."
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious, considering the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe pedal operation, first place the foot or foot on the floor and place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not break the car.
However, because the height of the heel and the angle of the foot are equal to the height of the heel, the area of the foot on the pedal is smaller and the area of the foot is not firmly stepped, making it difficult to make fine adjustments.
This could lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easily pulled by a heel or a heel, and when it comes to an emergency brake, the heel is pulled and the pedal is not stepped, or the heel is removed from the heel and the pedal is inserted into the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

"In recent years, Iran's drone "Aba Beer," which was used for this bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from the US military that crashed.
It is cheap and can be manufactured, with a distance of about 1000 km.
To fly low air, it is also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radar."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, led by President Rohani, and Iran cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo oil against Iran, we aim to inform the international community with the pain corresponding to it."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least the next year's election is over, since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of the U.S. military from the Middle East, Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fusi faction," said Mr. Sugawara.
The U.S. and Iran's "signal war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me (biz SPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption" that is employed as regular employees in their company.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, President and CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber, spoke about it.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Nowadays, YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
As elementary school students enter the top rankings of careers that they want to take in the future, the number of young people who are aiming for will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmans and comedians.
In the same way, "Youtuber adoption" is intended to support young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber is a reality that they don't make any profit as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, as well as creators who do not recognize their family as YouTuber.
This initiative provides the environment for salary and content creation to the creators employed.
At first, we will support the benefits of YouTuber's profession, which will become unstable.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA" Deputy Secretary of State for the United States - Yahoo! News
On 27th, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the U.S. Undersecretary of the Republic of Korea and Japan, Mr. Napper said, "We would like to reconsider and return Korea's decision to destroy the U.S. military information.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to reconsider the destruction of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information and other information.
When Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement in August, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea would collapse.
Napper said, "We cannot respond effectively to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat to "the first time in history."
The recent deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea has been pointed out as "aggravating national interest in the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill apart."

Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the rest of the war.
There is a need for good results in the mid-term competition that has been held since September.
Taiwan's Aces are strong in fighting.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), has already competed in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a very strong player and does not suffer from fighting.
As the tournament continues, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by gaining high points in the first half.
It was an impression that Shutensei was lacking in explosive power until last year, but since this year, the stability of the play has increased, it was able to continue with good results.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be a tougher opponent than ever.
In the first half of the match, other than the two players, the result was a Thai young Ace Cantaphon and the Indian Cy Planet B.
He is also the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who has been fighting for Europe.
Although Cantaphon does not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he won the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a lot of potential for a leap in the Olympic race.
Si Praneys B. also took a step away in India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been delayed due to injury, will also catch up in the future, so attention should be paid to the Indian forces after the mid-term battle.
New rates on mobile phones Price reductions in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was announced in October following the revision of the telecommunications business law.
However, it was generally stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga, Secretary of State, said last summer, "There is room to lower about 40%," and despite the high expectations of lowering prices, the price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been postponed and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
For consumers, it is desirable that fair competition makes it easy to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize and half the device.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes up to three-quarters of the terminal for only subscribers of the line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfer to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate release.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was due to the lack of progress in the development of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected that the price reduction competition would be explosives, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and rates of full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
This revision led to the remarks by the Secretary of State Kanbo.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to remain."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government prices will lead to a healthy competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out of government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention as there were cases where consumers were more than half the burden of consumers, although the terminals were advertising such as "maximum half."
To avoid misunderstandings of users by companies themselves, we must try to explain politely and easily.

Ten ryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu, and twelve sumo wrestlers at the time of autumn.
[ Rugby World Cup] 1st place and fight against the U.S. player's face-to-face dangerous tackle.
U.S. FLkyle is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was the last of the 20 countries to win the Rugby World Cup, and the U.S. finished 7-45 in England.
A black star, Lafplay played by Fljong Kyle later called a ripple.
He is forced to leave with a shoulder tackle on his face.
The actual scene was released by foreign media and video, and former English athletes complained that "not a tackle."
[Video] "It's insulting and cowardly play" and overseas ripple!
The moment when the U.S. representative Kyle played a face-to-face dangerous tackle...
The fight was over.
It's 29 minutes in the second half.
When the English commander Farrel caught his opponent's path, he fell in balance.
It was Kyle who went to Tackle.
However, he had an upper body rather than a lower body from his waist, and had a strong body on his upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other, and they are shaped like a head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
A fierce protest was made by the English players against the play, apparently lacking legitimacy.
The two men gathered together at once, and the air was instantly touched.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out of the red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked him to boo out for fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media staff featured the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: The U.S. players dropped out of poor play and England won."
"Kil made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Moña.
"It's an insult, it's poor, it's not a tack."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first 424 hospital names in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan that it judged that there was no medical record.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare examined the results of treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were included: the National Hospital Organization of Wara City; the Three Kingdom Hospitals of Kozen-cho Oda Hospital; the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganisation "the standard is strange."
Due to the aging of the population and the expansion of medical expenses, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in the competitive area.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and consolidation at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety about the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
It was announced at the same time.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1 percent, with relatively few beds.
In prefectures, the percentage was higher in terms of Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals for "high acute phase" for severe patients and " acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether a competing hospital is located within 20 minutes of a car, he judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the mass-produced families were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Agriculture has set the goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 119,11,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds for "high acute periods" and "acute periods" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require the elderly.
In order to cope with aging, the number of beds should not only be reduced but also increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by announcing the name of a hospital that has little experience.

On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was conducted in the forest, seven rice, and Kabe-cho in the Toshima tube.

When the level of fire warning was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in Mori and Nanai-cho, and residents were moved by buses and police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 districts recommended for pork cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock-borne disease "Tonn cholera," which allows preventive vaccination against domestic pigs that are not currently recognized.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products outside the region is permitted.
After public comment (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
The use of vaccines and recognition of extraterritorial distributions such as meat may not be a "clean country" certified by international organizations and affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the range, time, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines were revised, the situation was decided again.
Movements such as vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulations are generally limited to the region.
For meat and processed goods, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
To prevent damage from harmful rumors, he appealed to the safety of the infected pig.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasures Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments from prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is an open approach to Manu!
"You don't need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As far as last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and Keisuke MF Honda, a former member of the Japan National Team, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "Please give us an offer, but we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world's most famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian edition FOX Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could grab in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were the names of Honda.
Currently, the United has suffered injuries such as MFpole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshar, was forced to score 22 and 22 in the league, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, it is analyzed that Honda's contract as a creative side player rather than a striker can fill holes filled by Andreas Pereira.
"The 33-year-old Honda must leave his entertainment to manage the Cambodian representative and attract full attention."
Is it true that Honda's approach?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move because of the veterans who say that the next year's Tokyo Olympics will be a target.

now, don't you need the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not always tipping and hitting.
If you want to earn a distance in the second round of par 5, you will want to hit the ball on the ground, and there is also a technique called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves risk of falling balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24, he was 166 cm tall and is currently 7th in the driving direction category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
"I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot before spring, so I thought I would try Naodra."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the lawn of the Ti area, and the ball is cut off easily by 1W.
In the case where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but the two sides make use of direct dora in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"So I don't need 3W.Cady is more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cady Bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of lamenting leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if you hit the top, you can't fly straight, even if you hit it on the upper.I went to the right with a cut track.I originally had a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
If the ball doesn't catch and involves risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent on the left).
It's a professional skill that I don't know.

First release of the manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published at the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall.
The author Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) published his essay "Shoku literary, too literary," which was published in his last years by Junichiro Tanizaki and his literary theory, before the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall in Kita Ward, Tokyo was acquired by 27.

A total of 12 essays were published in the April 27 issue of "The Literary Spring Autumn."
"Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Mr. Greta Tonberg, Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweets] Greta Tounbeli, "Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Political commentators said Greta was mentally ill on the American television show "used by parents and international leftists."
In Japan, there are many reports on the Internet that comment on the part of Mr. Greta's speech, such as "It is used and cute."

They also pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to have problems with the story.
I don't understand why the adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.

what did you get at this tournament?
I didn't feel good recently, so I was glad that Fairway was able to keep a tight course.
It was a course where the rough and the reverse were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming videos.
I didn't have much else to change, but since there were fewer Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to overseas players."
We will continue in the second half of the game, but if we don't win more than one win, we would like to win another so we can't aim for winning the prize.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of forgetting?
Interviewed and written by Yoko Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be kept extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Dr. Toshisuke Otsuki spoke to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference between mildness and severity.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug, Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and the outstanding completion effect cannot be expected.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer while the death of infectious diseases and accidents is decreasing, and cancer deaths are also decreasing due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that dementia patients are increasing.
We need to create an environment where we can live with peace of mind throughout society.
how to keep things forgotten
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them as close as " forgotten."
dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is perceived as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence and absence of economic power.
For example, in the U.S., there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are available in frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
It is not possible to use gas and electricity, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook in the first place can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life of lipids and sugars.
In the end, it is poverty, but obesity, and when you talk about doing things, you can only see TV, and your body is disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who don't think about things or don't work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day and think about things.
