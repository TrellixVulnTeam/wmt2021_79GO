Driving in high heels is dangerous!
A number of young people mistake pedals - Yahoo! News
violation of road traffic laws
It's a big mistake to think that it's only an elderly driver.
According to the National Police Agency data (2015), more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is also a possibility that the young age group is distracted by other things, such as music and conversation, and it is possible to misstep due to clothes.
In particular, women choose various shoes and drive them as they wear high heels, pamps, sandals and mulls.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think it's troublesome to change their shoes, but some people don't think it's possible to get dangerous, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brake and other operations, Article 70 of the "safe driving obligation violation" which stipulates that "Do not drive to cause accidents and harm people."
In Article 71 of the Act on Road Traffic, Miyazaki Prefecture, for example, in Article 12 of the Act on Enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural Public Safety Commission.
The aim of each prefecture is to consider a violation of driving in footwear that may interfere with driving operations even if not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first place the foot or foot on the floor, then place the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not break the car.
However, because the height of the heel has an angle to the entire foot, the area of the foot on the pedal is smaller and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easily pulled by a high heel, and when it comes to a sudden brake, the heel is pulled and the pedal is not inserted, or the heel is removed from the heel and the heel is pulled, and the heel is stuck inside the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

He was one of the attorneys for the application, including Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), Daijo Yoshida Law Firm and Telephone 06-665-6038.
The company was founded in June 1895 and incorporated in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a Ibushi tile maker in Nishizumi-cho, Mihara County (present-day Minami-Awaji City).
In October 1986, he succeeded the business of the Kyowa Ceramic Industry Co., Ltd. and the Kinki Industry Co., Ltd., and changed the business name to the present Shogo and moved the main store to its present location.

The company established a wide range of sales bases centered in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was recognized as the best tile manufacturer of Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market following the Lehman shock, and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand was growing due to the increase in the number of consumers' roofs.

As a result, financial institutions were trying to rebuild their business by asking them to ease the repayment conditions for borrowings.However, there was no signs of recovery in business conditions, and the financial situation gradually began to tighten.
I couldn't help but abandoned the business continuity and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

[From St. Louis 27 (Japan time 28) ]
The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished, and according to the interview, "I'm not going to do anything for two days, but I'm not going to see baseball from the bench."
This season, he started 31 games with 6 wins, 8 losses, 398 defenses, and 178 throws 229 strikers.
In particular, in the latter half of the game, the ball form was stabilized, and he continued to play against the opponent with outstanding ball force and overwhelming ball strength.
"I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be like that.In spring, I thought, "I'm going to finish doing this too," but from there I feel that I can't believe myself when I go to a better place."
From early June, I gradually learned how to respond.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased and we can do one day more."
Although it was trial and error, it became more common to challenge the hypothesis itself one after another.
"I was thrown into the injured list every year" also led to confidence.
Darbish, who has the right to opt out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I'm going to think about it now, I'm going to talk to my agent and family," but "Basically, I don't have any dissatisfaction with this team and I'm happy."
There is no final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

is beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizuo's work? - Yahoo! News
Is there anything in common with mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and "Baizu-no-O Girl Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019, focusing on beautiful girls painted by Baizu-no-sensei, known as the first person in the horror manga.
If you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "frightness" of your work.
[Image] Are you attractive because there is a shadow?
5 beautiful girls of Baizu-no-Osaku
In the preface of "The Beauty Collection," there was a statement saying, "The fear, the uglyness, the shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out because of the beauty of the women in the opposite direction."
There is a keyword "sword" in many of the works that appear in Baizuna, but snakes can be seen as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and some people don't like them.
Thus, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
Also, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is auspicious.
There are "Tobi Girl" and "Later Girl" in 1965.
It is the market for beautiful women with shadows.
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ...
Among them, Orochi, the main character of Orouchi, which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday since 1969, is the representative character of Baizu's work, but it reminds me of snakes everywhere, such as sleeping deep every 100 years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

why is it a child cafeteria now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, Chairman and social activist of Yogo NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So, there was a demand for a regional exchange center for people and people.
It is a multi-generational exchange place where elderly people participate, even though it is said to be the gyogo cafeteria.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also leads to childcare support and the health of elderly people.
We cut down the chain of poverty and make the region healthy.
What's important is that we don't make children who are born from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day.
The scale varies from several to hundreds, and the venue is diverse from individual homes to temples.
There is an atmosphere where people who want to be able to enjoy.
The lowness of such a shikii is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
i've heard about issues like a safe management system.
"The connection with society becomes a safety net for disasters," Yuasa said.
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Aba Beer," which was used in this bombing, has dramatically improved performance by analyzing drones from the US military that crashed.
It is cheap and can be manufactured, with a distance of about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars to fly low air."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Dr. Sugawara, International Political Analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock returns.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are overshadowed by Trump's withdrawal from the Middle East.After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "signal war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, there are companies that started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is employed as regular employees in their company.
It is a direct marketing mix (DmMiX), a company that mainly operates CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director and Representative Director of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber, spoke about it.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: The profession of YouTuber is now adoring many young people.
As elementary school students enter the top rankings for their careers in the future, the number of young people who are aiming to continue to grow.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "Youtuber adoption" is to adopt young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
But why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, most YouTuber is a reality that they don't make any profit as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and few creators who do not recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for pay and content creation to creators who are employed.
At first, we hope to support our activities by supporting the disadvantages of the occupation of YouTuber that will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Assistant Secretary of State for the United States - Yahoo! News
U.S. Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Napper said on 27th, "I hope Korea will reconsider and return its decision to destroy Korea."
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is a platform for sharing information on missile launches between Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper said, "We can't respond effectively to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
As for the joint flight training conducted over the Sea of Japan in July, Nakaro also expressed the threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea has pointed out that the U.S. national interest will hurt.
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill apart."

Momota also has JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ Results 16), JapanOP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
There is a need for good results in the mid-season between September and September.
Taiwan's Aces are strong in fighting.
See also young Thai people!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), has already won seven tournaments.
In September, he joined the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a very strong player and does not want to fight.
As the tournament continues, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Although Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, it was possible to continue his good performance by increasing the stability of the play in this year.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In the first half of the game, the result was a Thai young Ace Cantafone and the Indian Cy Planet B.
He is the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who is struggling for a single European force.
Although Cantafone is not able to enter the finals at the top level, he is able to advance to the top level by entering the best four in the second season.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who can be rallying against top players seems to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic Games.
Cy Pranice B. also took a step in India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will also be driven out in the future.
New rates on mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was introduced to the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it almost stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations of lowering prices, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry of Rakuten will be forwarded and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be an easy-to-use pricing system by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to reduce the device by half.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to three-thirds of the terminal fee for only subscribers of the line.
The three companies continue to "enclose" to prevent transfers to other companies.
With regard to SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy requiring immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the improvement of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected that it would be a detonator for a price reduction competition, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-scale service is not revealed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility and work on business.
This revision led to the remarks by the Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of three companies: "I think the competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's okay to stay there."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government prices will ease the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention as there were cases where consumer burdens exceeded half of the total amount, while the terminal advertising such as "up to half the amount."
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, companies must try to explain polite and easy to understand.

[ Rugby World Cup] A one-stop escape and a fight against a U.S. player's face-to-face danger tackle, a foreign wave crest "A insult and a poor play" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FLkuil is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan tournament was held on 26 October, and the United States, which was the last of its 20 countries, was defeated in England by 745.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FLJohn Quill later called a ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene was published by foreign media as well as video, and former English athletes complained that "not a tackle."
[Video] "Follow and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The moment when the U.S. representative Kyle played a face-to-face dangerous tackle
A hot fight broke out.
It's 29 minutes in the second half.
When the English commander Farrell caught his opponent's path, he lost his balance.
I went to Tackle this was Kyle.
However, he had an upper body rather than a lower body from his waist, and violently hit his upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other, and they are shaped like a head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
A fierce protest was made by English players in the play, apparently lacking legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and the air quickly became air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out of the red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked him to boo out for fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media staff is featured in the headlines: Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out in poor play and England wins.
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's a coward, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the final defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first 424 hospital names in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare examined the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were designated: the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, Awara Hospital, the Three Kingdom Hospital of Kozen-cho, Oda Hospital, the Wakasa Takahama Hospital.
the standard is strange.
In order to reduce the cost of medical expenses expanding due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to promote reorganisation and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we asked the target hospital for full-scale review of reorganization and integration, and we would like to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no forced force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will repulse due to anxiety about the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total hospital was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
In prefectures, the ratio was high in Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated the "Advanced Acute Phase" for severe patients and 1455 hospitals for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether a competing hospital is located within 20 minutes of a car, and judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital is expected to be closed and some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the mass-groups were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare set the goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 1191,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "Advanced Acute Period" and "Acute Period" where nurses are placed thickly, and medical expenses are paid, but there is a shortage in rehabilitation that elderly people need.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with little experience.
A comprehensive training for disaster prevention, such as the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komake, the path, etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, seven rice, and Kabu-cho in the Toshima tube.

Large-scale training involving residents was the first time in 18 years.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the volcanic alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in forests and Nanai-cho, and residents moved by busses and police cars prepared by each town.

9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of domestic infectious disease "Ton" cholera," which would enable preventive vaccination against domestic pigs not currently recognized.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccinations is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is recognized.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and could affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended temporarily.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture will create a " vaccination program," which summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed, and will be approved by the province and allowed to use it by the governor's decision.
Other seven prefectures are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the guidelines are revised, the situation will be determined very once again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses and ovulations are restricted in principle to the region.
For meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is practically acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
He is also involved in the prevention of harmful rumors.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments from prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is an open approach to Manu!
"You don't need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and Keisuke MF Honda, a former member of the Australian A League, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "Please give us an offer, but we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent "reverse offers" is Manchester United, the world's most prestigious.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian edition FOX Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was named.
Currently, U.S. casualties include MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshal, was forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip hard, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill holes filled by Andreas Perilla."
9 points in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," but it is pointed out that Honda, 33 years old, needs to take full attention from his entertainment to manage Cambodian representatives.
Will the Honda approach be true?
It is also important to note that United will move because of the veterans who say that the Tokyo Olympics will be held next year.
500 portable translators completed installation of free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and shops | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
PokeTalk, a portable translation machine that lends free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on June 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 units to stores in Hamamatsu City, in a project to lend a portable translation machine "PokeTalk" to a member office for free.
It is said that it will be the first time in Japan to deploy this translation system in a centralized manner in the same region, and it will be noted whether it will lead to increased inbound support capacity.
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" was started to show the rental destination, and the smartphone showed the location of "stores for foreign languages."
It is accessible from sites in Lake Hamana.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city with the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce purchased 500 units, and lent them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want to connect with the development of new foreign customers while the business environment is severe."
now, you don't need to get the first hit, right?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not always ticking and hitting.
For example, if you want to earn a distance in the second round of the par5, you need to put a ball on the ground, and there is a so-called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves risk of falling balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
It is Ikemura Kanze who can wait for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in his seventh year, he was 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving direction category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
"I didn't shoot a spoon (3W) before spring, so I thought I would try Naodra."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball on the grass of the Ti area with a pointer, and you can also swing 1W.
In the case where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but the two sides are used to effectively utilize Naodora in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"So I don't need 3W.Caddy can be more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cady bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
It's also a pleasure to hear the words of lamenting leaking from the gallery that I saw.
The trick is to "make the club level horizontally."
"Even if you hit the top, you can't fly straight, even if you hit it on the upper.It's a cut track, and I'm going to go right.I originally had a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
If the ball is not caught and accompanied by a risk of slice, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that I can't believe in.

First release of a self-written manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published at the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall.
The author Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) obtained his own manuscript of his essay "Shoku literary, too literary," which was published in his last years by Junichiro Tanizaki and his literary theory, by the 27th day of the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Museum in Kita Ward, Tokyo.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.

Wedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go by the momentum in the second half, but I couldn't stretch the patter because it didn't work well.
did you see the sixth eagle, seventh bardy?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4 there was still a par 5 left, so if I tried to return, I had a chip in Eagle on No. 6.
In the seventh place, Bardy was able to get a chance, but I regretted that I couldn't reach in the second half.
what did you get at this tournament?
I didn't feel good lately, so I was glad that Fairway was able to keep a key even in a narrow course.
Because it was a course where rough and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed, so I didn't have much experience.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have much change elsewhere, but since there were only few Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the desire to "do not lose to overseas players."
We will continue in the second half of the game, but if we don't win more than one win, we'd like to win another so we can't aim for the winner.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to " forget"?
Interviews, Letters, and Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Dr. Toshisuke Otsuki talked about the stroke center.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Dnepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and there is no significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the death of infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have been declining due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve it by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment where society can live with peace of mind as a whole.
how to keep things up
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is hard to become?
Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them as close as " forget about things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle diseases and tends to be easier for people.
First, people in Metabo tend to become dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are available in frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used first.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased to lipids and sugars.
In the end, it is poverty, but obesity, and speaking of doing things, you can only see TV in a blur, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can be in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
