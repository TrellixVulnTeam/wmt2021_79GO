driving at high heels is dangerous!
The mistake of pedaling young people occurred frequently - Yahoo! News
violation of road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that it is only a matter of elderly drivers.
The number of years-old pedal accident cases (2015 National Police Agency data) exceeded 1032 cases over 75 years of age, with more than 1080 cases under 24 years old.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well as to the elderly.
do you take the oshale at your feet?
take safety?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is also a possibility that the young age group is distracted by other things, such as music and conversation, and it is possible to make mistakes due to wear.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulls.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people take care of changing their shoes, but some people do not think of the possibility that they can lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, and Article 70, which stipulates that "No driving should be done to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Don't drive a vehicle (except a light vehicle) without wearing shoes or shoes in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle or hinders the operation of the vehicle."
It is similar to the intention of each prefecture to consider driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operations" even if not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe pedal operation, first place the foot or foot on the floor and place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, then tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that the car does not break regardless of the car's behavior.
However, because the height of the heel has an angle to the entire foot, the area of the foot on the pedal is smaller and the size of the foot is smaller, making it difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get stuck with a high heel, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal is not taken, or the heel is removed from the heels and the heel is pulled, and the heel is removed from the back of the pedal.
There is also a case where the heel pulls back to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

He is one of the attorneys for the application, including Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, Yoshida Law Office, Tel 06-665-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a Ibushi tile maker, a local industry in Awaji Island in Nishinami-cho, Mihara-gun (present-day Minamiawaji City).
In October 1986, the company merged with Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd., succeeded the business of Kinki Industrial Co., Ltd., and changed its name to the current business name and moved its headquarters to its present location.

I couldn't help but quit my business and took this action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

There are people who like reptiles in the world, and some people don't like them.
In this way, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "evilness" may be a snake.
This creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is auspicious.
The Baizu works on the theme of the snake include "Tobi Girl" and "Later Girl" in 1965.
It is the market for beautiful women with shadows to become "Nabi-nyo."

Mr. Makoto Yuasa, Chairman and social activist of Yogo NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place where people met.
So there was a demand for a regional exchange center for people and people.
It is a place for multi-generational exchange, where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates the isolation, but also leads to child-rearing support and the health of the elderly.
We cut the chain of poverty and make the region healthy.
What's important is that we don't create children that are coming from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day.
The scale varies from several to hundreds, and the venue is diverse from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people who want to do is getting ready.
The lowness of such a shikii is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.

It seems to be the light of hope in the closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Aba Beer," which was used in the bombing, has dramatically improved performance by analyzing drones from the US military that crashed.
It is cheap and can be manufactured, with a distance of about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars to fly low air."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, led by President Rohani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Mr. Sugawara, an international political analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock returns.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are overshadowed by Trump's pledge to withdraw the US military from the Middle East, and Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "signal war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is a huge popularity among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising purposes, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption" that employs them as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are also at the top in the career rankings that they want to take in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "Youtuber adoption" is to adopt young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber and to support them.
But why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber has the reality of not being able to generate revenue that they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, as well as creators who do not recognize the existence of YouTuber to their families.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for pay and content creation to selected creators.
At first, we will support the disadvantage of YouTuber's profession, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Assistant Secretary-General of the United States - Yahoo! News
On 27th, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the U.S. Undersecretary of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Mr. Napper said, "We hope that Korea will reconsider and return the decision to destroy Korea in response to a single interview with the U.S. Ambassador's residence on November 23.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA's destruction.
GSOMIA is a platform for sharing missile launch information and other information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argues that without GSOMIA, the crisis cannot be effectively addressed.
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
China-Russia's joint flight training conducted over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out to "damaging US national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said.

Here, we look back at the first half of the Olympic race that took place next year in Tokyo from May to August, and we look forward to the mid-term battle (September to December) towards the men's singles (Badminton Magazine editorial department).
Starting in May, Budminton's Olympic Games digested the top four competitions (more than Super 500) at the end of the World Championship.
In the first half of the competition, two of them were Mototo Momota, who won the 2nd prize in the 4th tournament, and Shutensei in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championships and Zhou Tensei won the championship with the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also has JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ Results 16), Japan OP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
There is a need for good results in the mid-term competition between September and September.
Taiwan's ace with strong fighting.
See also young Thai people!
Sutennari, who also won the top tournament of the Indonesian OP and the Thai OP (S500), has already competed in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a very strong player and does not want to fight.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Although Zhou Tensei had an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, the stability of the play increased in this year, which allowed him to continue his good grades.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be a tougher opponent than ever.
The results of the first half of the game were Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Planet B.
He is also the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who has been fighting for Europe.
Although Cantaphon does not advance to the top level, he has the ability to win the top level, such as entering the top 4 in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step back in India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been delayed due to injury, will be caught up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price cuts at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in October following the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it almost stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga, Secretary of State, said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for a reduction in prices, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry of Rakuten will be forwarded and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a cost system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to half.
However, the "SIM Lock" that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days is a mechanism for terminals.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to three-thirds of the terminal fee for only subscribers of the line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfer to other companies.
With regard to SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) decided to require immediate release.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected that the price reduction competition would be explosives, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and prices of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility and work on the business.
This revision of the fee was triggered by the remarks by the Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it would be good to stay at all."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government-made prices will ease the market and encourage healthy competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out of the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that the terminal has advertising such as "maximum half" and that there are cases where the burden of consumers exceeds half.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, companies must strive to explain politely and easily.
A cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun

In the Mutsu room, there are ten ryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu, and 12 sumo wrestlers at the time of autumn.
[ Rugby World Cup] Departure & Struggle Overseas Waves "Following and Obscene Play" to U.S. player's "face risk tackle" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FLkyle is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was defeated by the United States at 7-45 in England on the 26th.
It was a black star, but Lafplay played by Fljon Quill later called a ripple.
He leaves with a shoulder tackle on his face.
Foreign media also released the actual scene with video, and former English players complained "not to call it a tackle."
[Video] "A insulting and poor play" and overseas ripple!
A moment when the US representative Kyle played a face-to-face dangerous tackle
The fight was over.
It takes 29 minutes to pick up at 0-38.
In the midst of the battle, the English captain Farrell had a balance when he caught his side's path.
It was Kyle who went to Tackle.
However, he had an upper body rather than a lower body from his waist, and had a strong body on his upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other, and they are in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
Clearly protested against the lack of legitimacy that the English players would fly to the Quil.
Both players gathered at once, and the air was instantly touched.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out of the red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked him to buy a fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media staff featured the headline "Rogue World Cup 2019: U.S. players dropped out of poor play and England won."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced a comment by commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's poor, it's not a tack."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first of its 424 hospitals to be named after 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were included: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, the Three Kingdoms Hospital of Shimotsuke-cho Oda Hospital, the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital.
the standard is strange.
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to encourage the reorganization and integration of hospitals in the competitive area.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we would like to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, the local chiefs and residents are expected to repulse due to anxiety about the disappearance of close hospitals.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total hospital was 29-1 percent, with relatively few beds.
In prefectures, the ratio of Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated the "Advanced acute phase" for patients with severe diseases and 1455 hospitals for general surgery.
They analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and analyzed whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes of the car, and judged the need for the release of the hospital name.
The target hospital will be considering abolishing and transferring some medical departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses surged in 25 years, when all of the clustered families were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health has set the goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 1191,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "Advanced acute" and "Acute Period" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are paid, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging of the population, it is necessary to reduce the number of beds and increase rehabilitation.
Regarding the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious attitude, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to promote the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention, such as the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komake, the road, etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill, which assumed the eruption of Mt.Komake (1131 meters), took place in the forest, seven rice, and Kabe-cho in the Watari-kan.

Large-area training involving residents was the first time in 18 years.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the level of volcanic alert was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in the forest and Shichii-cho, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.

9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock infectious disease "Tonn cholera" in order to prevent infection.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The movement of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccinations is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted.
After public comments (approved opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it could not be a "clean country" certified by international organizations and could affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has temporarily suspended its status as a clean country.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture will create a " vaccination program" that summarizes the range, time, number of heads, and how to proceed, and will receive confirmation from the Ministry and allow use by the Governor's decision.
Other seven prefectures are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the guidelines were revised, the region decided very much.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulation are restricted in principle to the region.
For meat and processed goods, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He appealed for the safety of the inoculated pigs and tried to prevent rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert conference held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasures Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is a public approach to Manu!
"You don't need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last year, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, the world's famous gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian edition FOX Sports, which was released 24 days later.
In an article entitled "5 FWs that Manchester United could grab in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was named.
Currently, the United has suffered injuries such as MF Pole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshal, was forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip hard, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, it is analyzed that Honda's contract as a creative side player, rather than a striker, could fill holes filled by Andreas Perilla.
"The 33-year-old Honda needs to gain full attention from his entertainment to manage the Cambodian representative."
Will the Honda approach be true?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move due to the veterans who say that the Tokyo Olympics will be held next year.
500 portable translators completed installation Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
"Poke Talk" is a portable translation machine that lends free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed a total of 500 units to store in Hamamatsu City in a project to lend a mobile translation machine "PokeTalk" to its members' offices for free.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a centralized manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will lead to improvement in the ability to respond to inbound (Japanese travelers to Japan).
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Maps" also started to show where you can see the location of a foreign language store on your smartphone.
It is accessible from sites in the Lake Hamana area.
The grant of PokeTalk to support 74 languages was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city with the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound city.
The Chamber of Commerce purchased 500 units and lent them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of acquiring hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want to connect with the development of new foreign customers while the sales environment is severe."
ikemura Kanyo, who is Naodra's name now, doesn't need to hit first?
today's caddy's best shot.
The 1W shot is not always up and down.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique to keep the ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance in the second round of par 5.
A recent 1W, due to its large head volume, involves the risk of losing the ball, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year, he was 166 cm tall and currently ranks seventh in the driving direction category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
"I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot before spring, so I thought I would try Naodra."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball on the grass of the Ti area with a crop, and you can also swing 1W.
In the case where Big Carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but the two sides make use of direct drag in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"So I don't need 3W.Cady can be more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cady Bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also glad that the battle method, which is surprised by the tour companions, will leak from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if you hit the lower blow, you can't fly straight, even if you hit the upper.It's a cut track and you go right.I used to do a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tiup).
Although the ball does not catch, it is accompanied by a risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that I don't want to know.

"Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Mr. Greta Tunberg, a Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Mr. Greta Tonbeli, "Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Political commentators commented on Greta's American television program, "It's mentally ill, and it's used for parents and international left-wings," and the television station was apologized.

i'm going to think of as long as i can think about lies and conspiracy theories.
Mr. Greta said, "Look, and again, as you notice, those who dislike me are as active as ever.My appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and I follow different places, they come to think of as long as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, but they seemed to ignore the topic.
I don't understand why the adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I wonder if they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.

I thought I could go by the momentum in the second half because I was able to reach the level of the first half, but it was regrettable because the patter did not stretch well.
did you see the sixth eagle and seventh bardy win?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I tried to get back, the chip-in eagle came in sixth.
But I was disappointed that I couldn't reach in the second half.
what did you do now?
I'm glad that Fairway was able to keep up even in a narrow course because I didn't feel good recently.
It was a course where both rough and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have much else to change, but since there were only few Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to foreign players."
I'd like to win another prize because I don't want to win more than one win, so I'd like to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to "get forgotten"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital He talked to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is believed that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug called Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and it is not expected that a significant recovery effect will be achieved.
On the other hand, people are able to live longer, as the deaths of infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and cancer deaths are declining due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
We need to create an environment where we can live with peace of mind in the community as a whole.
how to keep things forgotten
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to "get forgotten."
Dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be easier for people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used in the first place.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased to lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, poverty is becoming obese, and speaking of doing things, you can only see the TV blurry, and your body is disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
