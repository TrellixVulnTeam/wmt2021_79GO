Driving at high heels is dangerous!
A number of accidents involving young people pedaling - Yahoo! News
Traffic law violations
It is a big mistake to think that elderly drivers are only the problem.
According to data from the National Police Agency (JSC) in 2015, more than 1080 cases were 24 years old and 1032 cases over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to younger generations as well as to the elderly.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, there is a possibility that the young age group may be confused with other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, some women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulls.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think it is troublesome to change their shoes, but some people do not think of the possibility that they can lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that the operation should not be performed to cause accidents and harm people.
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee.In Article 12 of the Regulations for Enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, for example, "Tracks, slippers, sleeves, high heels, etc. are worn in a way that prevents the operation of vehicles (except light vehicles).
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that may hinder operation" even if it is not specified as high heels.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first place the foot on the floor, then place the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the car does not break regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the area where the kakato is placed on the floor is small, and the area where the kakato is placed on the floor is always folded and the height of the heel has an angle on the entire foot.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easily pulled by a high heels, such as emergency braking, when the heels are pulled and pedals are not stepped, or when the heels are pulled, the heels are removed and the heels are inserted into the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu's work? - Yahoo! News
What do you have in common with the mysterious beauty and the expression of the shadows?
Since the 1950s, a number of works have been sent to the world.The "Baizukazuo Beauty Girl Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear."
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls in Baizuna's work
In the preface of The Beautiful Girl Collection, there was a statement that "if there is a beauty of the women in the extremes of fear, uglyness, and the shocking scenes and developments of the story, there is a contrast between the beautiful faces and the expressions of the grudges that suffered from distortion and vengeance ..., it may be more "fear."
There is a keyword "sword" in many of the works that appear in Baizuna, but there are a variety of people who receive snakes, such as those who see them as "a creepy creature" or those who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others are not good at it.
Thus, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "beauty evil" may be a snake.
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times.
There is a Baizu work on the theme of the snake, "Mama Kowai!," a series of "Tobi Girl" and "The Little Girl."
It is the market for beautiful women with a shadow.
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ... I feel like it is in common with beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, Orochi, the main character of Orochi, which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work, but it is reminiscent of a snake somewhere in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping street declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So there was a demand for a regional exchange center for people and people.
It is a multi-generational exchange place where elderly people participate.
It will not only eliminate solitary food, but also help raise children and create health for the elderly.
We cut the chain of poverty and improve the region.
What's important is that we don't create children that are raised from there.
There are various places to offer meals every day.
The scale varies from several to hundreds, and the venue is diverse from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere of people who want to do is being created.
The lowness of such a shikii is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.

It seems to be the light of hope in the closed society.

"Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has been dramatically improved by analyzing drones from the US military that crashed in recent years.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, and its length is about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars to fly low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Shortly after, Yemen's anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, led by President Rohani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo oil against Iran, we aim to inform the international community with the pain corresponding to it."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least the next election is over, since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of the U.S. military from the Middle East," said Mr. Sugawara, "I know that Iran will continue to bomb drones on the grounds of hiding the Fusi, but the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever.
The U.S. and Iran's "subjective war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me.
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, but there are companies that have started a rare system called "Youtuber adoption" that employs them as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, the CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the company and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are also on the top of their career rankings for the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "Youtuber adoption" to recruit young people who are chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
But why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber is a reality that they don't have any revenue they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and creators who cannot recognize their family as YouTuber.
This initiative provides the environment for salary and content creation to selected creators.
At first, we would like to support our efforts by supporting the disadvantage of YouTuber's profession, which will become an unstable position.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Assistant Secretary-General of the United States - Yahoo! News
U.S. Assistant Secretary-General Napper said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return the decision to destroy the Japanese and Korean military information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 in response to a single interview of the Japanese-Korean newspaper at the Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information with Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper asserts that "the crisis cannot be effectively addressed without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by Churo over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea has been pointed out as "aggravating the interests of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill apart."

There is a need for a good result in the mid-term competition between September and September.
It is a Taiwanese ace that is resistant to fighting.
See also young Thai people!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), has already won seven championships.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a very strong player and does not suffer from fighting.
As the tournament continues, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by gaining high points in the first half.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but since this year the stability of the playing field increased, it was able to maintain good results firmly.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
The results of the first half of the match were Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Planet B.
He is also the third player of Unders Antonsen, who has been fighting for Europe.
Although Cantaphon does not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he has the power to win the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a huge potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step back in India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, will also catch up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was introduced to the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Law.
However, it almost stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga, Secretary of State, said last summer that "there is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for a reduction in prices, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry of Rakuten is forwarded and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to increase the device by half.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to three-thirds of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected that the price reduction competition would be an explosive, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and prices of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for the business.
This revision of the fee was triggered by Mr. Suga's remarks.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's good to stay at all."
However, it does not seem that the reduction in government-made prices will ease the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called for attention as there were cases where the consumer burden exceeded the half of the amount while the terminal advertising such as "up to half the amount."
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, companies must try to explain politely and easily.

The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI, who was transferred to Mutsu room including Yokotsuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on March 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers in the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUTSUNAGI, and one member of the Hitoyama family to Mutsu-shitsu.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Itsutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Daiseki Kirishima) was a brother of Chikakata ITSUTSUTSU, who was from Itsutsu-shitsu (a chamber of Itsutsu) and was a member of the family.
The Itsutsu Chikakata died suddenly on 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same mirror room, and the treatment was discussed in the future.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu, and so on.
[ Rugby World Cup] 1st outage & struggle Overseas ripples to "face risk tackle" by U.S. players - Yahoo! News
U.S. FLkuil is a rough play, former English representative, not a tack.
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan's final appearance in 20 countries was 7-45 in England.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by Fljong Quill in the latter half called a ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
A video of the actual scene was also released by foreign media, and former English athletes complained that "It's not a tackle."
[Video] "A insulting and poor play" and overseas ripple!
the real moment of the face danger tackle played by the U.S. representative kyle
A hot fight broke out.
It's 29 minutes in the second half.
In the midst of the enemy, the English general Farrell had a balance when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tuckle.
However, he had an upper body rather than a lower body from his waist, and had a strong body on his upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other and the person's head is in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
A fierce protest was made by English players in a play that clearly lacked legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once and quickly became air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out of the red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience who sought a fair play asked about booing.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced a comment by commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tack, it's a pitiful play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first of its 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were included: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, The Three Kingdom Hospitals of the Three Kingdoms of Wara City.
four hospitals that are subject to reorganization
Due to the aging of the population and the expansion of medical expenses, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in conflicting regions.
In October, I would like to ask the target hospital for a full-scale review of reorganization and integration.
There is no compulsion force, but it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety about the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total hospital was 29-1 percent, with relatively few beds.
In prefectures, the percentage was higher in the order of Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals for "high acute phase" and "acute phase" for severe patients.
They analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and analyzed whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need for the release of the hospital name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the mass generation were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals nationwide to 1191,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute" and "acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are paid, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation needs for elderly people.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the area is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention, such as the assumption of eruption of Mt. Komake, the road, etc.
On 27 September, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill, which assumed the eruption of Mt. Komake (1131 meters), took place in the forest, Shichii and Kabe-cho in the Toshima tube.
About 400 people from 20 organizations including roads and three towns participated.
Since the Hokkaido Komatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan that included evacuation routes for residents in August, the first event was held.
Large-area training involving residents is the first time in 18 years.
It is assumed that Mt. Komake erupted at 8:45 a.m. and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in the forest and Nanai Town, and residents moved by bus and police cars prepared by each town.

About 100,000 citizens, mainly students who sympathized with the 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Tunberg, marched on September 27 in Vancouver to protest climate change.
climate demonstrations in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall to Canby Bridge and from downtown libraries.
In front of the city hall of the meeting place, people with placards began to gather for hours before the start, and at 13 o'clock at the start time the number of people to fill the road in front of the city hall.
As a result, more than 100,000 people participated.
In the middle of the road, the police also cooperated with the road regulations, and watched all people for hours until they finished walking.
Along with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York City, Vancouver hosts a number of events to consider global warming from the last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Friday for the future.
The students who took part in the school on this day complained to the adults, "I want to protect the earth even if I rest the important thing of school," and many adults who took part in the work off responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning."
9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock infectious disease "Ton cholera" in order to prevent infection.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted outside the region.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed, and receives the approval of the province and allows use by the governor's decision.
Other seven prefectures are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga, and Saitama Prefectures.
When the guidelines are revised, the situation will be reviewed again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses and ovulations are restricted in principle to the region.
For meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
They also try to prevent harmful rumors.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7, and new anti-defection guidelines will be enforced.
A public approach to Manu, who is not affiliated with Keisuke Honda!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian edition FOX Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could grab in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda's names.
Currently, U.S. casualties include MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshal, was forced to play 22 games in the league, and had difficulty slipping.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, it is analyzed that Honda's contract as a creative side player, rather than a striker, could fill holes filled by Andreas Perilla.
Nine goals scored in the 18-game Melbourne Victory were "a solid record," but it is pointed out that Honda, 33 years old, needs to take full attention away from his entertainment management of Cambodian representatives.
Is the Honda approach true?
It is also important to note that the United will move because of the veterans who declared their goals for the next Tokyo Olympics.

The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on April 26 that it had completed a total of 500 stores in Hamamatsu City in the project to lend a portable translation machine "PokeTalk" to its members' offices.
It is said that it will be the first time in Japan to concentrate on the same region, and attention should be paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound travelers.

ikemura Kanyo, who is Naodra's name now, doesn't need the first shot or tiup?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not always ticking.
When you want to earn a distance by hitting the second of the par 5, you need to hit the ball on the ground, and there is also the so-called "naodra."
Recently 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of the ball being scattered, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24, he was 166 cm tall and is currently 7th in the driving direction category (average 304.02 yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
"I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot before spring, so I thought I would try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the lawn of the ti area, and it is sometimes sprinkled 1W.
In a case where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but the two sides are used in a narrow hall and so on.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if I hit the lower blow, I can't fly straight, even if I hit it on the upper, I'm going to the right with a cut track.I was originally doing a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
If the ball does not catch and involves the risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent on the left).
It's a professional technique that I can't believe.

The original manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa was released for the first time.
The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published at the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall.

what did you get at this tournament?
I didn't feel good lately, so I was glad that Fairway was able to keep up even in a narrow course.
It was a course where both rough and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have much else to change, but since there are only a few Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to foreign players."
We will continue in the second half of the game, but if we do not win more than one win, we will not be able to aim for the prize winner.

Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle diseases and tends to be easier for people.
First, people in metabo tend to become dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle diseases.

For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used first.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle biased to lipids and sugars.
In the course of time, it is poverty but obesity, and when you talk about doing things, you can only watch TV, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to read books from day to day and think about things.
