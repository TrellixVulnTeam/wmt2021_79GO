Driving at high heels is dangerous!
New York Times - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that elderly drivers are the only problem.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well as to the elderly.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that young people are distracted by other things, such as music and conversation, and they may be misstepped due to clothes.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on their clothes, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulles.
Some people know that it's not suitable for driving, but some people think it's troublesome to change their shoes, but some people don't think about the possibility of dangerous things at all, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, and Article 70 "Disclosure of safety driving obligations" which stipulates that "No driving should be done to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee.For example, Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act stipulates that the driver shall not drive the vehicle (excluding light vehicles) by wearing footwear in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle from wearing or preventing the operation of the vehicle.
The aim of each prefecture is to consider a violation of driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operations" even if it is not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, the foot is fixed to the floor and the foot is perpendicular to the brake pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the car does not break regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the area where kakato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is always small, and the height of the heel is angled to the entire foot.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easily pulled by a high heel, and when it comes to an emergency brake, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be trampled.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu-no-Okabu? - Yahoo! News
Is there anything in common with the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.The "Baizu Kazuo Girl Collection" (Genkosha) was launched in August 2019.
If you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between beauty and fear in your work.
[Image] Are you attractive because there is a shadow?
5 beautiful girls in Baizu-no-Oka's works
In the preface of the Beauty Girl Collection, there was a sentence saying, "The fear, the uglyness, the shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out because of the beauty of the women at the extreme."
There is a keyword "sword" in many of the works that appear in Baizuna, but snakes can be perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, and people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, but others don't like them.
Thus, by the sensibility of the viewer, "beauty" and "beauty evil" may be a snake.
This creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the white snake has arrived is auspicious.
There are "Nabi Girl" and "Lanother Girl" series in 1965.
It is the market for beautiful women with shadows to become "Hibi women."
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ...
Among them, Orochi, the main character of Orochi, which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work, but it reminds me of snakes somewhere, such as sleeping deep every 100 years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

why is it a child cafeteria now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, Chairman and social activist of Yotsu NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So there was a demand for a regional exchange center where people interacted with each other.
It is a multi-generational exchange place where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates solitary food, but also helps to raise children and health for the elderly.
We cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that we don't create children that are coming from there.
There are various places where meals are served daily from one month to another.
The scale varies from several to hundreds, and the venue is diverse from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere of people who want to do is getting ready.
Such a low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
i've heard about issues such as safe management.
"The connection with society becomes a safety net for disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems to be the light of hope for closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"The Iranian drone "Aba Beer," which was used in this bombing, has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing drones from the US military that crashed.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, and its length is about 1000 km.
It is also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars in order to fly low air."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo oil against Iran, we aim to let the international community know if there is a corresponding pain."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock comes again.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's election is over, since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East," said Mr. Sugawara, "I know that Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever.
The U.S. and Iran's "substitutional war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is employed as regular employees in their company.
Direct marketing mix (DmMiX), which is the main business of corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of YouTuber's subsidiary and staff first.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are also top in the career rankings they want to get in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, YouTuber adopts young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber and tries to support them.
But why did you consider hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber is not profitable as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and some creators who don't recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to creators who have adopted it.
At first, we hope to support activities by supporting the disadvantage of YouTuber's profession that will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Deputy U.S. Secretary General - Yahoo! News
Mr. Napper, Assistant Secretary of State for the United States, said on November 27 that he would like to reconsider and return Korea's decision to destroy the Japanese and Korean military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is a platform for sharing missile launch information with Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August, South Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argued that without GSOMIA, the crisis could not be effectively addressed.
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by Churo over the Sea of Japan in July also marked a threat as "the first time in history."
The recent deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea has been pointed out as "aggravating national interests in the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role in closing apart."

Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
A good outcome is required in the mid-term competition from September onwards.
Taiwan's Aces are strong in fighting.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already competed in seven competitions.
In September, he joined the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a strong player and does not suffer from a series of battles.
As the tournament continues, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
By winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Until last year, Zhou Tensei had an impression of lack of explosive power, but this year, the stability of the play increased, which allowed him to continue his good grades.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be a bigger opponent than ever.
Other than these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Planet B.
And it's the three players of Anders Antonsen, who are struggling for the Europeans.
Although Cantaffon did not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he was able to advance to the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic Games.
Cy Pranys B. also took a step back in India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, will be caught up in the future, so attention should be paid to the Indian forces after the mid-war period.
New rates on mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in October following the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it generally stopped high.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga, Secretary of State, said last summer that "there is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations of lowering prices, there was no price competition.
The major factor is that the full-scale entry into Rakuten has been postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be able to use fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to half.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
With regard to SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected that it would be a detonator of competitive price reduction, so it was cool to shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and prices of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
This revision led to the comments of the Secretary of State Kanbo.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies: "I think the competition will start from now on, and I don't think it would be good to stay at all."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government-made prices will ease the market and encourage healthy competition.
Enterprises should develop customer-oriented competition before they are told by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half" the consumer's burden exceeded half.
We need to make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by companies themselves.
Reduced withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen Cash card in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
The three credit safes in Mie Prefecture ( Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank and Kikita Shinkin Bank) announced on September 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of cash card withdrawals to prevent damage to special scams.

The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be closed on October 1, and the Kikita Shinkin Bank will be lowered from November 1.

He transferred to Mutsu room including Yokotsuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
On the 27th, the Japan Sumo Association announced that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers in the Izutsu room including Yokozuna Tsururyu and Hitoyama to Mutsu-shitsu.

Itsutsu Chikakata died suddenly on 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the mirror room of the same gate, and future treatment was discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are 10 ryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu, and 12 sumo wrestlers at the time of autumn.
[ Rugby World Cup] A one-off and a fight against a U.S. player's face-to-face dangerous tackle is an overseas ripple "a insult and a cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FLkyle is a rough play, former English representative "not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup was the last game to be played in 20 countries, and the United States finished 7-45 in England.
The Black Star was launched, but the late Rough Play, played by FL John Quill, called the ripple.
A single exit is made to add shoulder tackle to the opponent's face.
Foreign media also released the actual scene with video, and former English players complained that "not a tackle."
[Video] "A insulting and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The moment when the U.S. representative Kyle played a face-to-face dangerous tackle is the real moment.
A hot fight broke out.
It takes 29 minutes to pick up at 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy, the English general Farrell was somewhat balanced when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tuckle.
However, he raised his upper body rather than his lower body from his waist, and violently hit his upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other, and they are in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
A fierce protest was made by English players in the game, apparently lacking legitimacy.
The two men gathered at once, and the air was instantly touched.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out of the red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked him to boo out for fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players dropped out of poor play and England won."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving him."
In the article, he introduced comments from the commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the final loss.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first 424 hospital names in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were provided: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, Awara Hospital, The Three Kingdoms Hospital of Kudzen Town, Oda Hospital, The Wakasa Takahama Hospital.
four hospitals that are subject to reorganisation
Due to the aging of the population and the expansion of medical expenses, the hospital needs to be restructured and integrated with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, there is a possibility that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety about the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total hospital was 29-1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the ratio was high in Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that could accommodate "high acute periods" for severe patients and " acute periods" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes of a car, and judged the need for publicizing the hospital name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the mass population were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds to 1191,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds for "high acute periods" and "acute periods" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require the elderly.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials have discussed, many local residents and chiefs have maintained their cautious stance and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with little experience.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention such as the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komake, road etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was conducted in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Watarishima tube.

Large-area training involving residents was the first time in 18 years.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were established in forests and Nanai-cho, and residents moved by bus and police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock infection "Ton" cholera, which would enable preventive vaccination against currently unrecognized cattle.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs, which are vaccinated, is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is recognized.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, the procedure will be completed in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and could affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has temporarily suspended its status as a clean country.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed, and is confirmed by the province and allowed to use it by the Governor's decision.
The other seven prefectures are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will review the situation again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulation are generally restricted to the region.
For meat and processed goods, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
He is also involved in the prevention of harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is an open approach to Manu!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, Mr. Keisuke MF Honda, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "Please give us an offer, but we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a famous worldwide.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, released on 24 October.
In an article entitled "5 FWs that Manchester United could grab in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was named.
Currently, United is suffering from injuries such as MF Pole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Sullshal, was forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip hard, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, it was analyzed that Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, could fill a hole filled with Andreas Perilla.
Although 9 points scored in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory are "solid records," it is pointed out that " 33-year-old Honda needs to gain full attention from his entertainment management of Cambodian representatives."
Do you really have a Honda approach?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move because of the veterans who say that the Tokyo Olympics will be held next year.

ikemura Kanyo, who is Naodra's name now, doesn't need the first shot or tiup?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not always tiring.
For example, if you want to earn a distance by hitting the second shot of Per 5, you will want to hit the ball on the ground, and there is also a technique called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves risk of falling balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in his seventh year, he is 166 cm tall and is currently seventh in the driving stance division (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he said, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodra."
You can drop the ball from the practice round to the top of the lawn in the ti area, and sometimes swing 1W.
In cases where big carrie is required, a lot of tiup is used, but both sides are used to effectively utilize the direct drag in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if you hit the lower blow, you can't fly straight, even if you hit the upper, you'll go right with the cut track.It was originally a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
Although the ball does not catch and involves risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
Cantan says ... but it is a professional technique that I can't imagine.

A self-written manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa was released for the first time.
The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published at the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall.
The author Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) published his essay "Shoku Bunshi Village Memorial Museum" in Kita Ward, Tokyo, which was published in his last years by Junichiro Tanizaki and his literary theory.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.

A total of 12 essays were published in the April 27 issue of "Ryushu Shunshu."
"Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Mr. Greta Tunberg, Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.

did you see the sixth eagle, seventh bardy?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5.
But I was disappointed that I couldn't reach in the second half.
what did you get at this tournament?
I didn't feel good recently (shots), so I was glad that Fairway was able to keep up even in a narrow course.
It was a course where rough and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (like a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for gallery people.
There wasn't much else that changed, but since there were only few Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
We will continue in the second half of the game, but if you don't win more than one, you won't be able to aim for the winner.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to " forget about things"?
Interviewed and written by Yoko Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that it is possible to remain extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital A stroke center Professor Toshisuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a difference in the degree.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug, Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptations in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and cancer deaths are also decreasing due to remarkable advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve it by yourself or family, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind.
how to keep things down
Are there people who are prone to dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to " forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle diseases, and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people with metabol tend to become dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where cooking is not possible can be used.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, it is poverty but obesity, and speaking of doing things, you can only see the TV carefully, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
