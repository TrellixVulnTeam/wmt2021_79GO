Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving young people pedaling multiple times - Yahoo! News
Traffic law violations
It is a big mistake to think that it is only a matter of elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that the young age group is distracted by other things, such as music and conversation, due to accidental mistakes, clothing, etc.
In particular, some women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals and mulles, and drive them as they are.
Some people know that it's not suitable for driving, but some people think it's troublesome to change their shoes, but some people don't think it's possible that they can lead to danger at all, and many people drive without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and Article 70 "Safety driving obligations violation" which stipulates that "No driving should be done to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee.In Article 12 of the Rules for Enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, for example, "not to drive vehicles (excluding light vehicles) without wearing footwear in a manner that prevents or hinders driving operations, such as wearing shoes, slippers, sleeves, high heels and other footwear."
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if it is not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first place the foot on the floor, then place the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right as a branch.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that the car does not break regardless of the car's behavior.
However, since the height of the heel has an angle on the entire foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller, making it difficult to adjust finely.
This may lead to danger.
Most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get rid of the high heels, and sometimes the heels are pulled and the pedals are not trampled, or the heels are removed when the heels are pulled.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

I could not help but abandoned the business continuity and took this action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

Dalbisch summarised this season, "It's good to make a difference in your life." - Yahoo!
[From St. Louis 27 (Japan time 28) ]
The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished, and the Cubs' Dalbisch pitcher (33) who finished the playoffs this season told him about the current state of mind: "I'm not doing anything for two days, but I'm sorry to see baseball from the bench without any purpose."
This season began with 31 games, 6 wins, 8 losses, 398 defenses, 178 throws, 229 strikeouts.
In particular, in the second half of the game, the ball form was stabilized, and he continued to play against the opponent with outstanding ball force and overwhelming ball strength.
"I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be that kind of feeling.In spring, I thought "I'm going to end this way too," but from there I feel that I can't believe myself that I came back to a better place."
From around early June, I gradually learned how to respond.
"The more things we can do every day, the more we can do one day."
Although trial and error occurred, it became much more common to challenge the hypothesis itself one after another, resulting in better grades.
He also became confident that he was thrown into the injured list throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, said, "We have to think about it now, we're going to talk with agents and families," but "Basically, we don't have any complaints about this team and we're fun."
The final conclusion is not reached, but the feeling is firm.

Five beautiful girls in Baizuna's work
In the preface of the Beauty Girl Collection, there was a statement that "if there is a beauty of the women in the extremes of fear, ugliness, and the shocking scenes and developments of the story, they stand out."
There are many things that appear in Baizu-no-Oka's works called "swords," but snakes can be seen as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, but others don't like them.
In this way, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
This creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is auspicious.
There is a Baizu work on the theme of the snake, "Mama Kowai!!" series of "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl."
It is the market for beautiful women with shadows.
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ... I feel like it is in common with beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, Orochi, the main character of Orochi, which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work.

[Eczan Wakamizu] A circle of "Children's Shokudo" that provides free or inexpensive meals for children is spreading throughout the country.
According to a survey by NPOs and other organizations, about 3700 sites are active in Japan this year.
The number of cases increased by one or six times compared to 2018, and there are 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by nine compared to last year.
why is it now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, the chairman and social activist of NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So there was a demand for a regional exchange center where people interacted with each other.
It is a multi-generational exchange place where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates isolated food, but also helps raise children and create health for the elderly.
We cut the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that we don't create children from there.
It varies from one month to one place where meals are served daily.
The venue is diverse from several hundred people to hundreds, from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people want to do is becoming more and more.
The lowness of such a threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
we've heard about safety management issues
According to Yuasa, "By interacting with many people, values change."
It looks like a light of hope in a closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, the Iranian drone "Aba Beer," which was used in this bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the crashed US military.
It is cheap and can be manufactured, with a length of about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars to fly low air."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Soon after, Yemen's anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, and Iran cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo oil against Iran, we aim to inform the international community that there is a corresponding pain."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are overshadowed by Trump's commitment to withdrawing U.S. forces from the Middle East, and Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "subjective war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me.
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, there are companies that have started a rare system called "YouTuberr Adoption" that employs them as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): The profession of YouTuber is now adoring many young people.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, hiring young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber and trying to support them is the adoption of YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, most YouTuber is a reality that they don't have the same income as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time jobs, and creators who don't recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to creators who are hired.
At first, we intend to support activities by supporting the disadvantages of YouTuber's profession that will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Deputy U.S. Undersecretary - Yahoo! News
Mr. Napper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the United States, said on November 27 that he would like to reconsider and return the decision to destroy Korea in response to a single interview with the Nikkei newspaper at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is a platform for sharing missile launch information with Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper said, "We cannot respond effectively to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
As for the joint flight training conducted in July over the Sea of Japan, China and Russia also expressed the threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating US national interests."
"There is no intention of mediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill the gap."

The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland Basel) in Badminton's Big Event in August, finished a training camp in early September and participated in the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) which opened from 17 August.
Here, we look back at the first half of the tournament from May to August, when the Tokyo Olympic Games were held next year, and look forward to the men's singles for the mid-season (September to December).
At the end of the World Championship, the Badminton Olympic Games began in May.

In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
There is a need for good results in the mid-term competition from September onwards.
Taiwan's Athlete.
See also young Thai people!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by gaining high points in the first half of the game.
Although Shutensei had an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, due to increased stability in the field of play this year, he was able to continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
The result of the first half of the game was the Thai young Ace Cantaphon and the Indian Cy Planet B.
He is the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who is struggling as a European force.
Although Cantafone is not able to enter the finals at the top level, he is able to advance to the top level in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic Games.
Cy Pranys B. also took a step forward in India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, will be caught up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in October following the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Law.
However, it was generally stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga, Secretary of State, said last summer that "there is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite expectations for a reduction in prices, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fair competition that makes them easy to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to reduce the device by half.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of the line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy to require immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was not due to the development of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected that it would be a detonator of competitive price reduction, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and prices of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I want you to take responsibility for your business.
This revision of the price was triggered by the comments of the Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think the competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's good to stay at all."
However, "Government of government-made prices" seems to distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "up to half the amount" the consumer burden exceeds half the amount.
Companies should try to explain politely and easy to understand so that they do not misunderstand users themselves.
Cash Cards in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
The three credit safes in Mie Prefecture ( Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on September 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawals by cash cards to prevent damage from special fraud.

[Video] "A insulting and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The moment of the "face risk tackle" played by the U.S. representative Quill
A hot fight broke out.
It takes 29 minutes to pick up at 0-38.
In an attempt to capture the enemy's path, the English commander Farrell lost his balance.
I went to Tackle.
However, he caused the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist, and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with the other person's head and are in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown up and collapsed.
A fierce protest was made by English players against a clear lack of legitimacy.
The two men gathered together at once and became an air of touch.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked about booing for fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" is featured in the headlines of Rugby World Cup 2019: The U.S. players are out of play and England wins.
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, a coward, not a tackle, it's a cowardly play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the final defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare examined the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.
four hospitals that are subject to reorganization
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote restructuring and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we ask for a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
There is no forced force, but it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that a nearby hospital will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total hospital was 29-1 percent, with relatively few beds.
In prefectures, the percentage was higher in terms of Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals for "high acute periods" for severe patients and " acute periods" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether a competing hospital is located within 20 minutes of a car, and judged the need for publicizing the hospital name.
The hospital will be considered to be abolished and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the mass population were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 191,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds for "high acute periods" and "acute periods" where nurses are placed thickly and cost medical expenses, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services for elderly people with high needs.
In order to cope with the aging of the population, it is necessary to not only reduce the number of beds but also increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the area is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention, including the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komake, the road, etc.

It was the first time in 18 years that local residents participated in extensive training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt. Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were established in forests and Nanai-cho, and residents moved by bus and police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 regions recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Ton" cholera, an infectious disease, to prevent the infection.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been identified.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods outside the region is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, the procedure will be completed in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and recognizing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended temporarily.
In the revision, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up a "Voculation Recommended Area" based on the opinions of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccinant vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed, and is confirmed by the province and allowed to use it at the governor's discretion.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region is determined very once again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses and ovulations are generally restricted to the region.
As for meat and processed goods, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable for distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
In order to prevent harmful rumors, he appealed for the safety of the inoculated pigs.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasures Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is an open approach to Manu!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Time, made a public approach to a club saying, "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent a "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "5 FWs that Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Boney were Honda's names.
Currently, U.S. casualties include MF Pole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip hard.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill holes filled with Andreas Perilla."
9 points scored in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," but it is pointed out that Honda, 33 years old, needs to get a full attention from his entertainment managing Cambodian representatives.
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move due to the veterans who say that the next Tokyo Olympics will be a target.

PokeTalk, a portable translation machine that lends free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on June 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 units to stores and other stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy this translator in a concentrated manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will lead to improved inbound response capabilities.
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.

It is accessible from sites in Lake Hamana.

now, don't you need to hit first?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not necessarily tipping.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second ball on the ground.
Recently 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of the ball being scattered, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Kanyo Ikemura is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year of professional career, he was 166 cm in height and is currently seventh in the driving stance division (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he said, "I didn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I would try Naodra."
You can drop the ball from the practice round to the top of the grass in the ti area, and you can also swing 1W.
In a case where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd in Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cady Bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if you hit the top, you can't fly straight.It's a cut track and you go right.I used to do a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tiup).
Although the ball does not catch, it is accompanied by a risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that I don't want to know.

I didn't have much else to change, but since there are only a few Japanese players co-hosted, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to overseas players."
It will continue in the second half of the game, but if you don't win one or more, you can't aim for the winner, so I want to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to " forget"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be kept extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital A stroke center Professor Toshisuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug called Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and there is no significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and cancer deaths are declining due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind.
how to keep it down to the level of forgetfulness
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is hard to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to " forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be easy to become.
First, Metabos tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is considered as one of the lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be stored.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased to lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, it is poverty but obesity, and speaking of what to do, you can only see the TV vaguely, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can also be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
