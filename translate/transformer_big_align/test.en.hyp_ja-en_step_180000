Driving at high heels is dangerous!
A number of accidents occurred due to wrong pedaling of young people - Yahoo! News
Traffic law violations
However, it is a big mistake to think that it is a problem only for elderly drivers.
The number of accidents caused by pedal accident by age (2015 National Police Agency Data) exceeded 1032 cases over 75 years of age, with more than 1080 cases aged 24 years or younger.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well as to the elderly.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflex nerves, there is a possibility that the young age group is distracted by other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulles.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people say it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people don't think about the possibility of dangerous things at all, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, high heels and sandals are in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, and Article 70, "Disclosure of safety driving obligations," which stipulates that "no driving should cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee.For example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, there is a statement that the driver shall not drive the vehicle (excluding light vehicles) in a manner that prevents the operation of the vehicle (excluding light vehicles).
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operations" even if not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first the foot is fixed on the floor, then the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the foot is tilted to the right.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that the car does not break regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, because the height of the heel has an angle on the entire foot, the area of the foot on the pedal is smaller and the area of the foot on the pedal is difficult to adjust.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material makes it easy to get a high heels, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heels are pulled and pedals are not trampled.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beauty girls of Baizuo's work? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common with mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, a number of works have been sent to the world.The "Baizukazuo Beauty Girl Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of your work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls in Baizuna's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "if there is a beauty of the women in the extremes of fear, ugliness, and the shocking scenes and developments of the story," but because of the contrast between the beautiful face and the distorted expression of resentment ...
There are many things that appear in Baizu-no-Oka's works that are called "swords," but snakes can be perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others are not good at it.
Thus, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "beauty evil" may be a snake.
This creature has been worshipped as a spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is auspicious.
There is a Baizu work on the theme of the snake, "Nabi Girl" and "Later Girl" in 1965.
In general, it is the market for a beautiful woman with a shadow.
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type if you put it in an imaginative way? ...
In particular, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be the representative of Baizu's work, but it reminds me of a snake somewhere in order to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

Mr. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, deleted the comments on Twitter that he wrote "It's delicious" when he ate at a barber shop in Saga Prefecture by 27.
Mr. Yamamoto entered the prefecture on 26th to explain the results of the accident that the AH64D combat helicopter of the Ground Self-Defense Force crashed last February in Kanzaki City, the prefecture.
On the night of the same day, "I visited Saga Prefecture on a business trip!"

[Ecsan Wakamizu] There is a circle of "Children's Shokudo" that provides free or inexpensive meals for children nationwide.
According to research conducted by NPOs and other organizations, about 3700 sites are active throughout Japan this year.
There are 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by 9 compared to last year.
why is it now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, the chairman and social activist of the NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So there was a need for a regional exchange center where people interacted with each other.
It is a multi-generational exchange place where elderly people participate, even though it is said to be the gyoko-shokudou.
It not only eliminates solitary food, but also contributes to child rearing and the health of elderly people.
It cuts the chain of poverty and improves the region.
The important thing is, "Don't make children from there."
There are various places to offer meals every day from one month to another.
The venue is diverse from several to hundreds, from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people want to do is becoming more and more enjoyable.
Such a low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
they're also hearing issues like secure management systems.
"The connection with society will become a safety net for disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems to be the light of hope for closed society.

"The culprit" - Yahoo! News
"Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has dramatically improved its performance in recent years by analyzing drones from the US military that crashed.
It is inexpensive and can be manufactured, with a range of about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that it's hard to catch radar because it flies low."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" announced the crime statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Dr. Sugawara, International Political Analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"I would like to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections have ended, as Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of the US military from the Middle East, and Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "associative war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is employed as regular employees in their company.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi (Kobayashi): Now, YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are also on the top of the vocational rankings they want to take in the future, and the number of young people who are aiming for will increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmans and comedians.
In the same way, hiring young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber and trying to support them is the adoption of YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber is not profitable as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, as well as creators who don't recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide the creators with an environment for pay and content creation.
At first, we would like to support activities by supporting the disadvantages of the occupation of YouTuber that will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Assistant Secretary of State for the United States - Yahoo! News
Mr. Napper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the United States, said on November 27 that he would like to reconsider and return the decision of the Korean government on November 23 of the Japan-Korea Military Information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing information on missile launches between Japan, Korea, the United States, and Korea.
When the agreement between Japan and Korea was cancelled in August, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea collapsed.
Napper argues that "the crisis cannot be effectively addressed without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
"It is essential that the United States and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, cooperate in the alliance," said Naka-Russia, a threat to joint flight training conducted in July over the Sea of Japan.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating national interests in the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said.

Momota won the World Championships and Zhou Tensei won the championship with the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic race.
In addition to this, Momota also holds the Japan OP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
A good result is expected in the middle of a series of high-level tournaments since September.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.

Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a very strong player and does not want to fight.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Zhou Tensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the play increased so that he could continue his good grades.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be a bigger opponent than ever.
The results of the first half of the game were Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Planet B.
And he is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who has been fighting for Europe.
Although Cantaffon does not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he has the power to win the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a great deal of potential for a leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step away in India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been delayed due to injury, will be catching up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price cuts at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released due to the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Law.
However, it generally stopped high.
In the summer of last summer, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten has been postponed and the oligarchy of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, communication fees were set to increase.
Softbank and KDDI (au) announced plans to increase the number of terminals by half.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to three-thirds of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has decided to immediately terminate the SIM lock.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected to be a detonator of the price reduction competition, so it was a nice shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-scale service is not revealed.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for the business.
This revision of the rate was triggered by the comments of the Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it would be good."
However, "Government of government-made prices" does not seem to distort the market and promote healthy competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out of the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "up to half the amount," there are cases where the consumer burden exceeds half the amount.
It is necessary to make careful and easy-to-understand explanations in order to avoid misunderstandings of users themselves.
Cash card for 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
The three credit safes in Mie Prefecture ( Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on June 26, that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawals by cash cards to prevent damage from special fraud.

In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers, including Juryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] 1st place and fight against the U.S. player's face-to-face danger tackles and overseas ripples "A insult and poor play" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quill is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan's final appearance in 20 countries was 7-45 in England.
Although it was a black star, Lafplay, played by Flind Quill in the latter half, called a ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.
A video of the actual scene was also released by foreign media, and former English players complained that "a insult and a poor play" "not a tackle."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The moment of the actual "face risk tackle" played by U.S. Representative Quill
A hot fight broke out.
It takes 29 minutes to pick up at 0-38.
The English commander Farrell, who was deeply enraged by the enemy, had a balance when he caught his opponent's pass.
It was Kyle who went to Tackle.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and hit the upper body violently.
As a result, the head and the head of the opponent are in contact with each other, and the head is in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
A fierce protest was made that the English players would fly through Quill, apparently lacking legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and the air was instantly touched.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for a fair play.
The local media staff of New Zealand, a strong rugby union player, headlined the Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players dropped out of poor play and England won the game.
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's poor, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The United States, which lacked one game, managed to escape a complete loss in an attempt to win the game in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first of its 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "the standards are strange."
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging population, it was necessary to reorganize and integrate hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we would like to request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we would like to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no forced force, the local chiefs and residents are expected to repulse due to anxiety that a nearby hospital will disappear.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total number of hospitals was 29-1 percent, with relatively few beds.
In prefectures, Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent) and Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of participants was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated the "Advanced acute phase" of public and public hospitals for severe patients and 1455 hospitals for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need for publicizing the hospital name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the mass population was 75 years or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals in 18 years to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "Advanced Acute Period" and "Acute Period" where nurses are placed thickly, and medical expenses are required.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials are discussing, many local residents and chiefs remain cautious, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with a poor track record.

9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo!
On March 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a revision of the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Ton" cholera, an infectious disease in livestock.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted outside the region.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, the procedure will be completed in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
Based on the opinion of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry set up a "communization recommended area" for areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination, receives the Ministry's confirmation, and permits use by the Governor's decision.
The other seven prefectures are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga.
When the guidelines have been revised, the situation will be determined again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, ovulations, etc. are generally limited to the region.
For meat and processed goods, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute outside the territory.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
In order to prevent harmful rumors, he appealed for the safety of the inoculated pig.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert conference held on the same day, and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments on prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.
A public approach to Manu, who is not affiliated with Keisuke Honda!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a famous worldwide.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian edition of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could grab in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda's names.
Currently, United is suffering from injuries such as MF Pole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshal, was forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip hard, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Perilla."
His 18-game score at Melbourne Victory was "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that " 33-year-old Honda needs to take full attention away from his entertainment managing Cambodian representatives."
Is the Honda approach true?
It is also noteworthy that the United will move due to the veterans who say that the Tokyo Olympics will be held next year.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and shops | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
"PokeTalk" is a portable translation machine that rents 500 stores in Hamamatsu City for free.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed a total of 500 units to store in Hamamatsu City, in a project to rent a portable translation machine "PokeTalk" to its member offices.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy this translator in a concentrated manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will lead to improved inbound response capacity.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations and 134 other establishments.
The district covers 60% of the population.
We also started showing rentals to Google Maps, a map app that allows us to understand the location of a foreign language store on a smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan of Poketalk to 74 languages was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city with the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce purchased 500 units and lent them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of acquiring hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We hope that the business environment is severe and will lead to the development of new foreign customers."
now, don't you need the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
A 1W shot is not necessarily a tie-up.
For example, if you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of the par5, you will want to hit the ball on the ground, and there is a technique called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which is associated with the risk of falling balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in his seventh year, he is 166 cm in height and is currently ranked seventh in the driving direction category (average 304.02yd).
While he was good at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he said, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I wanted to try Naodra."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball on the lawn of the ti area with a pot, and you can easily swing 1W.
In a case where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but both sides are used effectively in a narrow hall.
"It can be used in halls where the eye line is lowered."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd in Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration from the gallery that I saw in the battle method that surprised my tour companions.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if you hit a down blow on the upper, you can't fly straight, even if you hit it on the upper.It's a cut track and you go right.I originally did a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tiup).
Although the ball does not catch, it is accompanied by a risk of slice, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that I don't want to think about.

They also pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to ignore the topic.
I don't understand why the adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.

I felt that I could go by the momentum in the second half because I was able to reach the level in the first half.
did you see the sixth eagle, seventh bardy?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5.
But I regretted that I couldn't reach in the second half.
what did you get at this tournament?
I didn't feel well recently (shots), so it was good to have a good fit even in a narrow course.
It was a course where both the rough and the reverse were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have much else to change, but I just co-hosted a competition with few Japanese players, so I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
It will continue in the second half of the race, but if you don't win one or more, you can't aim for the winning king, so I want to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to " forget"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits can be kept extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital A stroke center Professor Shunsuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a difference in degree.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug, Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as death due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have been declining due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind.
how to keep things to forget
Is there anyone who is easy to become dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them as " forget about things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are available in frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, poverty, but obesity, and what we do, we have to look at television, and our physical disability.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
