Driving in high heels is dangerous!
An accident in which young people mistake pedals - Yahoo! News
violation of road traffic laws
However, it is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
The number of accidental pedal accident cases by age (2015 National Police Agency data) exceeded 1032 cases over 75 years of age with more than 1080 cases under 24 years of age.
It is important to call attention to young people as well as to the elderly.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is also a possibility that young people are distracted by other things, such as music and conversation, and they are misstepped due to clothes.
In particular, some women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulles.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people don't think about the possibility of dangerous things at all, and many people are driving without any hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brake and other operations, and Article 70 "Disclosure of safety driving obligations" which stipulates that "No driving should cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters set by the prefectural public safety committee.For example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, there is a statement that the driver shall not drive the vehicle (except light vehicles) by wearing footwear in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle (except light vehicles).
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in footwear that may interfere with driving operations even if not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first fix the foot to the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not blow regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the area where the kakato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal becomes smaller and the fine adjustment is difficult.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get rid of the high heels, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heels are pulled and the pedals are not trampled.
In addition, there is a case where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from the crashed US military.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, and its range is about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars to fly low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Dr. Sugawara, International Political Analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock comes again.
"I don't want to avoid military interventions until at least next year's elections are overshadowed by Trump's pledge to withdraw from the Middle East," said Mr. Sugawara, "Iran will continue to bomb the drones on the cover of the Fusiites, but the United States will not be able to endure it forever.
The U.S. and Iran's "associative war" are facing immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber has become a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).

YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, some companies have started a rare system called "YouTuberr Adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
How does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: The occupation of YouTuber is now adored by many young people.
Elementary school students are also on the top of the vocational rankings that they want to take in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams of bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, hiring young people who are chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber and trying to support them is hiring YouTuber.
But why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber is a reality that they don't have any revenue they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time jobs, and creators who don't recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to selected creators.
At first, we will support the demerits of YouTuber's profession, which will become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Assistant U.S. Undersecretary - Yahoo! News
Mr. Napper, Assistant Secretary of State for the United States, said on November 27 that he would like to reconsider and return the decision to destroy Korea in response to a single interview with the Nikkei newspaper at the Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information with Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper claimed that he could not respond effectively to the crisis without GSOMIA.
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-ROK relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of mediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

Japan, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland Basel) in badminton's big event in August, finished a training camp in early September, and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17th.
Here, we look back at the first half of the Olympic Games that took place in Tokyo next year, starting from May to August, and look forward to the men's singles in the mid-season (September to December).
Badminton's Olympic race began in May, and at the end of the World Championship, he digested the top four (super 500 or more) competitions for top players.
In the first half, Kento Momota, who won two of the four championships, and Shutensei (Cho Tienchen) in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championships and Shutensei won the championship with the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic race.
In addition to that, Momota also controls JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/2013), Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
A good result is expected in the mid-term competition that will be held after September.
Taiwan's aces are strong in fighting.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), has already won seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from fighting.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the play increased so that he could continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
The results of the first half of the game were Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Planet B.
He is also the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is struggling in Europe.
Although Cantafone does not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he has the power to win the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old 18-year-old) who is now able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step back in India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Sliccans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will also catch up in the future, so attention should be paid to the Indian forces after the mid-war period.
New charges for mobile phones Price reductions in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as part of the revised Telecommunications Business Law in October.
However, it generally stopped high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for a reduction in prices, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to half.
However, both companies can't use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to three-thirds of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) decided to require immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was due to the lack of progress in the development of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be a detonator of the competition, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and fees of the full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision of the price was triggered by the remarks by the Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's going to be okay."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government prices will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called for attention as there were cases where the burden of consumers exceeded half while the terminal advertising such as "maximum half price."
Companies should try to explain politely and easily to avoid misunderstandings by themselves.
Cash Cards for 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
The three credit safes in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on August 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage from special fraud.
In the past three years, the bank has a cash card of three banks: Kuwana Mie, Kita Ise Ueno, and Kihoku, with a limit of 500,000 yen per day for depositors over 70 years old who have never made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs.
The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be closed on October 1, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank will be lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are spoofed by financial institutions and police officials, and those in the Shinkin Bank are sent to ATMs.
Transferred to Mutsu room including Yokotsuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
On the 27th, the Japan Sumo Association announced that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers in the Izutsu room, including Tsururyu YOKOTSUTSUNAGI, to Mutsu room with Chikakata ITSUKI (Genseki Wakifuko).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki) was a brother of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was from Izutsu-shitsu (a chamberlain of Izutsu) and was the son of Chikakata ITSUTSU.
The Itsuzu Chikakata died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the mirror room of the same gate, and future treatment was discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] 1 dropout & struggle Overseas ripples to "face risk tackle" by U.S. players - Yahoo! News
U.S. FLkuil is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tack."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was held on 26 February, and the United States, the last of its 20 countries, was defeated in England by 7-45.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FLJohn Quill later called a ripple.
One drop is made to add shoulder tackle to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene of the film was also released by foreign media, and former English players complained that it was "not a tackle."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The moment of "face risk tackle" played by the U.S. representative Quill is the real moment of departure.
A hot fight broke out.
It's 29 minutes later when I arrived at 0-38.
The English commander, Farrell, was deeply invincible when he caught his side's path.
It was Kyle who went to Tackle.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist, and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other, and the person's head is in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
The English protested against the obvious lack of legitimacy in the play.
Both players gathered together at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the spectators asked for a fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headlines of Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out of poor play and England win.
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and became a retreat," he said.
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Mona, a former English player.
"It's an insult, it's a coward, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The United States, with only one player in the game, managed to escape the final loss in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced the name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, the Three Kingdom Hospitals of the Three Kingdoms of Wara City, the Oda Hospital in Echizen Town, the Wakasa Takahama Hospital.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "the standards are strange."
In order to reduce medical costs, which are expanding due to aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we would like to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety about the disappearance of a nearby hospital.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was higher in Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that could respond to "high acute phase" for severe patients and " acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, as well as whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all the mass-produced generations were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds to 191,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "Advanced acute" and "Acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require the elderly.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
Regarding the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials are discussing, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
General training for disaster prevention, including the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komake, roads, etc.

At 8:45 a.m., Mt. Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were established in forests and Nanae-cho, and residents moved by bus and police cars prepared by each town.

9 regions recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of domestic infectious disease "Tonn cholera" to prevent the infection.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs, which have been vaccinated, is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is recognized.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set the "Recommended Area for Vaccination" based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program," which summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed, receives the Ministry's confirmation, and allows them to use it at the Governor's discretion.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines have been revised, the situation will be reviewed again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses and ovulations are restricted in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed goods, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and is virtually acceptable to distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
To prevent harmful rumors, he sued for the safety of the inoculated pigs.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectural governments will be conducted until October 7th, and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is an open approach to Man U!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and now his former Japan representative, Keisuke MF Honda, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan time, made a public approach to a club, saying, "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a famous worldwide.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "5 FWs that Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unincorporated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonney were Honda's names.
Currently, United has suffered injuries such as MF Pole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshal, is forced to lose 22 games in the league and slip through hard, challenging the quality of the front line.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill holes filled by Andreas Perilla."
9 points scored in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory are "solid records," but it is pointed out that "The 33-year-old Honda needs to take full attention away from his entertainment managing Cambodian representatives."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move due to the veterans who announce that the Tokyo Olympics will be held next year.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and shops | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
"PokeTalk" is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on August 26 that it had completed a total of 500 units to stores in Hamamatsu City, in a project to lend a portable translation machine "PokeTalk" to its members' offices.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a centralized manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound travelers.
The loan included 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" also began to show the rental destination, so I could see the location of a foreign language store on my smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The project started in April with the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber of Commerce buys 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We want to help foreign customers develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
now, don't you need to tie up the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not always tipping and hitting.
When you want to earn a distance by hitting the second of the par5, you need to hit a ball on the ground, and there is also a technique called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of falling balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in his seventh year, he is 166 cm tall and is currently 7th in the driving stance division (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he said, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodora."
You can drop the ball from the practice round to the top of the lawn in the ti area, and you can easily swing 1W.
In cases where big carrie is required, a lot of tiup is used, but both sides are used to effectively utilize the direct drag in narrow halls.
"You can use it in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration that leak from the gallery.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if you hit the lower blow, you can't fly straight, even if you hit it on the upper.It's a cut track and you go right.I used to do a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tiup).
The ball does not catch, and it is accompanied by risk of slices, but "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that you can't imagine.

Wedgeshot of Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the Pater was not able to stretch well.
did you see the sixth eagle and seventh bardy win?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I tried to get back, the chip-in eagle on No. 6 came.
But it was regrettable that Bardy was not able to reach the end of the season.
what did you get at this tournament?
I didn't feel good recently (shots), so I was glad that the fairway was able to keep a tight course.
It was a course where both the rough and the reverse were broken and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for galleries.
I didn't have much else to change, but just because there are fewer Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to foreign players."
We will continue in the second half of the game, but if you don't win more than one, you won't be able to aim for the winning king.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to " forget about things"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are failing to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that it is possible to remain extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Professor Shunsuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a difference in the degree.
However, it is believed that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug called Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and it is not expected to have a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as death due to infectious diseases and accidents is decreasing, and cancer death is also decreasing due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
We need to create an environment where people can live with peace of mind in the community as a whole, not only by themselves and families.
How to keep things down to the degree of forgetting.
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and to keep them as " forget about things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle diseases and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, there are regions in the United States that distribute food tickets to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people who live in environments where they cannot cook can be used in the first place.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased to lipids and sugars.
In the course of time, poverty, but obesity, and speaking of doing things, you can only see the TV vaguely, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
