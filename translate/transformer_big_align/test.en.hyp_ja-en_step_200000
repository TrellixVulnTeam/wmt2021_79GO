Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving young people's pedals - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that elderly drivers are the only problem.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years of age.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that the young age group is distracted by other things such as music and conversation, and there is a mistake due to clothes etc.
In particular, some women choose a variety of shoes and drive them as they wear high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulles.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think it is troublesome to change their shoes, but some people do not think of the possibility that they can lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and Article 70 "Safety driving obligations violations" which stipulates that "No driving should be done to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee.For example, Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law stipulates that the driver shall not drive the vehicle (excluding light vehicles) in a way that prevents the driver from wearing or preventing the operation of the vehicle (excluding light vehicles).
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in footwear that may interfere with driving operations even if it is not specified as a high heels.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first fix the foot to the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right as a branch when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it doesn't feel comfortable regardless of the car's behavior.
However, because the height of the heel has an angle to the entire foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller, making it difficult to adjust finely.
This can lead to danger.
Most cars also have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get rid of the heels, and sometimes the heels are pulled by the heels and the pedals cannot be trampled, or the heels are removed by the beats that the heels are pulled, and the heels are stuck in the back of the pedals.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu-no-Yusaku? - Yahoo!
What do you have in common with the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.The "Baizu Kazuo Girl Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
If you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of your work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls in Baizu-no-Oka's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "the fear, the ugly, the shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only because of the beauty of the women in the opposite direction."
There is a keyword "single" in many of the works that appear in Baizu-nashi, but snakes can be perceived as creepy creatures by the viewer or people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and some people don't like them.
In this way, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
This creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times.
There are "Hibi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
It is the market for beautiful women with shadows to become "Hibi-nyo."
In other words, can I say "cool beauty" type? ...I feel like it is in common with beautiful girls appearing in Baizu work.
Among them, Orochi, the main character of Orochi, which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work.

Mr. Makoto Yuasa, president and social activist of the NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So, there was a demand for a regional exchange center where people interacted with each other.
It is a "multi-generation exchange place" where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates solitary food, but also helps to raise children and improve the health of elderly people.
Decide the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that we don't create children from there.
There are various places where meals are served daily from one month to another.
There are a wide variety of venues ranging from several to hundreds, from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people who want to do is getting ready.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to manage and secure staff.
i've heard about issues like a safe management system
"The connection with society will become a safety net in disaster situations," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

Three of the eight models are for women's use, and as Nike Women's Footwear Senior Creative Director Georgena James says, "Women are diverse and seek something different from others," updates are added based on her experience in the collection "The One Reimagined" (launched in 2018), which redesigns sneakers from a female perspective.
[Image] Eight new models of "Air Force 1" appeared, including NBA collaboration and Goretex models.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"Aba Beer, a Iranian drone used in this bombing, has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing drones from the US military that crashed.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, and its range is about 1000 km.
It is also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars to fly low air."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Soon after, Yemen's anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Dr. Sugawara, International Political Analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock comes again.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's election is over, since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, and Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fusi factions, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "External War" are facing immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber became a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me.
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, some companies have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is employed as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, the CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to get in the future, and there will be more and more young people aiming for in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams of bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, hiring young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber and supporting them is the adoption of YouTuber.
Why did you consider hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber is not profitable as expected.
There are many creators who are making videos and posting videos while working part-time jobs, and many creators who are unable to recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for pay and content creation to creators who are hired.
At first, we will support the demerit of YouTuber's occupation, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary - Yahoo! News
U.S. Deputy U.S. Undersecretary of State for Korea and Japan, Napper said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return the decision to destroy the Japanese and Korean military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 in an interview with the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is a platform for sharing missile launch information with Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information will collapse.
Napper argues that "the crisis cannot be effectively addressed without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also marked the threat of "the first time in history."
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
A good result is needed in the mid-term competition, which has been held since September.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutensei, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he joined the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from fighting.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
By gaining a high point in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the play increased so that he could continue his good grades.
To Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
The results of the first half of the game were Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Planet B.
And he is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone in Europe.
Although Cantaphon does not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he has the power to win the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old 18-year-old) who has become able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step out of India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, will be driving up in the future, so attention should be paid to the Indian forces after the mid-war period.
New charges for mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in October following the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Law.
However, it generally stopped high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for a reduction in prices, there was no price competition.
The major factor is that the full-scale entry into Rakuten has been postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fair competition that makes them easy to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize and half the device.
However, both companies can't use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected to be a detonator of the lower price competition, so it was cool to shoulder.
It may have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for the business.
This revision of the fee was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it would be good."
However, I don't think the reduction in government-made prices will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price," there are cases where consumer burden exceeds half price.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, companies should try to explain politely and easily.

In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] 1st place and fight against the U.S. player's "face risk tackle" overseas ripple " insulting and cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quill is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tack."
The Japan Rugby World Cup was held on 26 July, and the United States, the last of its 20 countries, lost 7-45 in England.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by Fljon Quill later called the crest.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
A video of the actual scene was also released by foreign media, and former English players complained that "not a tackle."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by the U.S. representative Kyle.
A hot fight broke out.
The second half is 29 minutes.
In the midst of the enemy, the English captain Farrell fell in balance when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tackle.
However, he caused the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other, and they are in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
The English protested against the obvious lack of legitimacy in the play.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the spectators asked for a fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players are out of play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving him."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The United States, with only one player in the game, managed to escape the final loss in the 81st minute.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced the name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nika.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reviewed the results of treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, the Three Kingdoms Hospital, the Three Kingdoms Hospital of Kutzen-cho Oda Hospital, the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital.
the standard is strange.
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
There is no forced force, but it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety about the disappearance of nearby hospitals.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total hospital was 29.1 percent, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent) and Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of participants was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that could respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need for publicizing the hospital name.
The hospital is expected to be closed and some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds in 18 years to 1191,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "Advanced Acute Period" and "Acute Period" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require the elderly.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital that has little experience.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention, such as the assumption of eruption of Mt.Komake, road, etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Watarishima tube.
There were about 400 staff and residents of 20 organizations, including roads and three towns.
It was the first event since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan that included evacuation routes for residents in August.
For the first time in 18 years, extensive training has been conducted by residents.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and the mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were established in forests and Nanai-cho, and residents moved by buses and police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of domestic infectious disease "Ton cholera" to prevent the infection.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs, which are vaccinated, is restricted to the region, but distribution of meat and processed foods outside the region is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set the "Recommended Area for Vaccination" based on the opinions of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the range, time, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination, receives the Ministry's confirmation, and allows use by the Governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the situation will be decided again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulation are generally restricted to the region.
For meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute outside the territory.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
They also try to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7 and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
A public approach to Manu, Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
He left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League last season, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, released on 24 October.
In an article titled "5 FWs that Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda.
Currently, United is suffering from injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshar, was forced to slip in the league with 22 wins and 22 losses.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a new candidate for Teco.
According to the article, Honda's contract as a creative side player, rather than a striker, can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira.
He scored 9 goals in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory, but "The 33-year-old Honda needs to leave his entertainment to manage the Cambodian national team and attract full attention."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move due to the veterans who say that the next Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
500 mobile translators completed installation Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es

The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on July 26 that it had completed a total of 500 stores in Hamamatsu City for a free loan of a portable translation machine called "PokeTalk."
It is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a centralized manner in the same region, and attention is paid to whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound travelers.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.

now, don't you need to tie up the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not always tipping.
For example, if you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of the par5, you can hit the ball on the ground and use the technique called "naodra."
Recent 1Ws involve risk of ball scattering due to their large head volume, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in her seventh year of professional career, she is 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodra."
From the practice round to the top of the lawn in the ti area, the ball can be dropped and the ball can be easily sprinkled 1W.
In cases where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but both sides are used effectively in small halls.
"You can use it in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd with Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"You can't fly straight, even if you hit the top with a down blow.I'm going to the right with a cut track.I originally had a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
Although the ball does not catch and involves risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that I can't imagine.

"Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Greta Tunberg, a Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Tounbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?
Political commentators said Greta was " mentally ill and used by parents and international leftists" on American television and apologized.
In Japan, there are many reports that commenting on the part that Greta doesn't speak about, such as "It's used and cute" and "It's better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on Twitter, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'm going to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories.
Greta says, "Look, it started again, as you realize, those who hate me are still active, chasing my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I differ from others, they come to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to have a point of discussion.
I don't understand why the adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.

Because I didn't feel good recently (shots), I was glad that Fairway was able to keep a tight course.
It was a course where both rough and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming videos.
There wasn't much else that changed, but since there were only a few Japanese players co-hosted, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to overseas players."
It will continue in the second half of the game, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for winning the prize winner, so I want to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of forgetting?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with their research and development challenges.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital The Stroke Center Professor Toshisuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug called Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and there is no significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are also decreasing due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
We need to create an environment where we can live with peace of mind in the community as a whole.
how to keep it to the degree of forgetfulness
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to " forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle diseases, and tends to be more prone to people.
First, metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, poverty becomes obese, and speaking of what you do, you can only see the TV vaguely, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
