Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Accidents caused by the wrong pedal of young people - Yahoo! News
Violations against Road Traffic Law
It is a big mistake to think that it is only a matter of elderly drivers.
The number of accidental pedal accident cases by age (2015 National Police Agency data) exceeded 1032 cases over 75 years of age, with more than 1080 cases under 24 years old.
It is important to call attention to younger generations as well as to the elderly.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, it is possible that the young age group is distracted by other things such as music and conversation, and there is a mistake due to clothes etc.
In particular, some women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulles.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people do not think of the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and Article 70 "Safety driving obligation violation" which stipulates that "No driving should cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee.For example, Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law stipulates that the driver shall not drive the vehicle (excluding light vehicles) in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle by wearing or preventing the operation of the vehicle (excluding light vehicles).
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in footwear that may interfere with driving operations even if it is not specified as high heels.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious considering the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first place the foot on the floor, then place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right as a starting point when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not break regardless of the car's behavior.
However, in high heels, the area where the kakato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also small because the heels are always worn and the height of the heels are angled on the entire foot.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easily pulled by a high heels, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heels are pulled and the pedals are not trampled.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu-no-Yusaku? - Yahoo! News
Is there anything in common between the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadow?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.The "Baizu Kazuo Girl Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
If you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of your works.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls in Baizu-no-Yu's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "if fear, ugliness, and the shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only because of the beauty of the women in the opposite direction," but because of the contrast between the beautiful face and the distortion of the face and the expression of resentment ..., more "fear" may stand out.
There are many things that appear in Baizu Kazuo's works that have the keyword "snake," but snakes can be perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, and people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, others are not good at it.
In this way, by the sensibility of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be the living thing in the back.
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
Generally, it is the market for beautiful women with shadows to become "Hebi-nyo."
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ... I feel like it is in common with beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, Orochi, the main character of Orochi, which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work.

Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So he said, "We needed a place for exchange in a region where people interacted with each other.
It is a place for multi-generational exchange, where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates solitary food, but also helps to raise children and improve the health of the elderly.
Decide the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that we don't create children from there.
There are a variety of places to offer meals every day from one month to another.
The venue is diverse from several to several hundred people, from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people who want to do is getting started.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
i've heard about issues such as safe management.
"Connecting with society becomes a safety net for disasters," Yuasa says.
It seems to be the light of hope in the closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing the drones of the crashed US military.
It can be manufactured at a low cost, and its range is approximately 1000 km.
It's also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radar because it flies low."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Shortly after, Yemen's anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo crude oil against Iran, we aim to inform the international community with corresponding pain."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"I don't want to avoid military interventions until at least next year's elections are over, since Trump has publicly stated the withdrawal of US troops from the Middle East, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "Period War" are facing immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, some companies have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is employed as regular employees in their company.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, the CEO of DmMiX and the representative of the company's staff first, which was actually adopted by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings for elementary school students who want to get in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, hiring young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber and trying to support them is hiring YouTuber.
But why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber is not able to generate revenue as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time jobs, and some creators who don't recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for pay and content creation to creators who have adopted it.
At first, we will support the demerit of the profession of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary of State - Yahoo! News
U.S. Undersecretary for the U.S. Undersecretary of State for the Republic of Korea, Mr. Napper said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return the decision to destroy the Japan-Korea Military Information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information with Japan, Korea, the United States, and Korea.
In August Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper claimed, "We cannot respond effectively to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill apart."

This is a feature that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and it is a feature that has traditionally been realized with third-party apps.
And Sidecar is Apple's pure function, so it is expected that it is better at perfection (or response).
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next generation of macOS fully.

Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the World Championship with Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
A good result is needed in the mid-term battle where the top tournament since September continues.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but since this year's stability in the field of play increased, he was able to continue his good performance.
To Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
The results of the first half of the game were the Thai young Ace Cantaphon and the Indian Cy Planet B.
And it's the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is struggling as a European.
Although Cantaphon does not advance to the finals at the top level, he has the power to advance to the top level, such as entering the fourth best in the second season.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is now able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step back in India, where he was one of the best players in singles.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, will be catching up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as a result of the revised Telecommunications Business Law in October.
However, it generally stopped high.
In the summer of last year, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, price competition did not occur.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry of Rakuten was postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fair competition that makes them easy to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, communication charges were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize and half the device.
However, "SIM Lock" is a device that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) decided to require immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten did not lead to the improvement of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected to be a detonator of lower price competition, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
It may have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for the business.
This revision of the price was triggered by the comments of the Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's good to stay at all."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government prices will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
The corporate side should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price," the consumer burden may exceed half price.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users by the company itself, we must keep in mind a polite and easy-to-understand explanation.
Reduced withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen Cash card for 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on September 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawals by cash cards to prevent damage from special fraud.

The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be closed on October 1, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank will be lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by ATMs, including financial institutions and police officials.
Transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAGI | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers in the Izutsu room, including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAGI, to Mutsu room, with the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUTSU (Genseki Wakifuko).

In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu, and so on.
[Rogue W Cup] One-shot Departure & Struggles Overseas ripples to "face danger tackles" of U.S. players - Yahoo! News
The US FL Quill is a rough play and former England representative, "It's not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan's final appearance in 20 countries was 7-45 in England.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FLJohn Quill in the latter half called a ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
A video of the actual scene was also released by foreign media, and former English players complained that it was "not a tack."
[Video] "A insulting and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The real moment of "face risk tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill.
A hot fight broke out.
It takes 29 minutes to pick up at 0-38.
The English commander, Farrell, was deeply invincible when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tuckle.
However, he caused the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other, and the person's head is in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
A fierce protest was made by English players in a clearly lacking legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an immediate air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked him to boo.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby player, is featured in the headline "Rogue World Cup 2019: A U.S. player leaves in poor play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving him."
In the article, he introduced comments from the commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the final defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste behind.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), for the first time, announced the name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nika.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: the National Hospital Organization of Wara Hospital of Wara City; the Three Kingdom Hospitals of Wara City; the Oda Hospital of Echizen-cho; the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "the standards are strange."
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote restructuring and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we would like to request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that the nearby hospital will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total hospital was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53, 7%), Hokkaido (48, 6%), Miyagi (47, 5%), Yamaguchi (46, 7%) and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of participants was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals that could respond to "high acute phase" for severe patients and " acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need for publicizing the hospital's name.
The hospital is considered to be abolished and some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the mass population was 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds in 18 years to 191,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds for "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while rehabilitation for elderly people is lacking.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance, and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention, including the assumption of eruption of Mt.Komake: The first time in 18 years (video) in a wide area with participation of residents: Hokkaido Shimbun

It is assumed that Mt.Komake erupted at 8:45 a.m. and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in both Mori and Nanai towns, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.

9 regions recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of pig cholera, an infectious disease that is not currently recognized.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs that have been vaccinated is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods outside the region is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed, and is confirmed by the province and allowed to use it by the governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the situation will be determined very once again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulation are generally restricted to the region.
As for meat and processed goods, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is practically acceptable to distribute outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
They are also concerned with the safety of inoculated pigs and prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to the prefectural government will be conducted until October 7th, and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is an open approach to Man U!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a prestigious worldwide.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United may have caught in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda's names.
Currently, United is suffering from injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshar, was forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill holes filled by Andreas Perilla."
9 points scored in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," but it is pointed out that Honda, 33 years old, needs to take full attention away from his entertainment managing Cambodian representatives.
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move due to the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
"PokeTalk" is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed a total of 500 units for stores in Hamamatsu City in the project to lend a portable translation machine "PokeTalk" to its member offices for free.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy this translation machine in a concentrated manner in the same region, and it is noteworthy that it will lead to improved inbound response capabilities.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
It occupies 60% of the city.
The map app "Google Map" also began to show where to rent it, so I could see the location of "stores for foreign languages" on my smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city with the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I want to help foreign customers develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
now, don't you need the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not necessarily tipping.
If you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of the par 5th, you can hit the ball on the ground and use the so-called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of scattering balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in his seventh year, he is 166 cm tall and is currently seventh in the driving direction category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodra."
The ball can be dropped from the practice round to the top of the grass in the ti area, and it can also be sprinkled with 1W.
In cases where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"You can use it in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd with Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of lamenting leaking from the gallery that I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if you hit the lower blow, you can't fly straight.When you hit the upper, you go right with the cut track.I was originally doing a direct drag to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the time of tiup).
Although the ball does not catch, it is accompanied by risk of slice, "So the left side can be erased (not bent on the left).
It's a professional technique that I don't want to think about.

"Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Greta Tunberg, a Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is drawing attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Tounbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?
A political critic told Greta that he was mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing on American television, and apologized to the television station.
In Japan, there are many reports on Greta's comments on the Internet, such as "It's used and cute" and "It's better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on Twitter, "Why do adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children?"
i'm going to think of as many lies and conspiracy theories as possible.
Greta said, "Look, it started again, and as you notice, those who dislike me are still active; they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm different from people; they come to think of as long as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to ignore the issue of the story.
Honestly, I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if people like the change, they don't like it.
I'll meet you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20th, the week before, a global climate strike was held in New York and elsewhere.

Wedgeshot of Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I couldn't stretch the patter because it was not very good.
did you see the sixth eagle and seventh bardy win?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, I still had a par 5.
No. 7 was a chance for Bardy, but I was disappointed that I couldn't reach it later.
what did you get in this tournament?
Since I didn't feel good recently (shots), I was glad that I was able to keep the fairway in a narrow course.
It was a course where rough and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have much else to change, but I just co-hosted a competition with few Japanese players, so I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to overseas players."
It will continue in the second half of the game, but if you don't win more than one, you won't be able to aim for the winner.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to "getting things"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has become clear that it is possible to keep it extremely mild and forget about things.
Kinki University Hospital A stroke center Professor Toshisuke Otsuki spoke to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a difference in the degree.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and a significant cure effect cannot be expected.
On the other hand, the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents is decreasing, and cancer deaths are also decreasing due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible for individuals and families to solve this problem, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind.
How to keep things to an extent of forgetting.
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to " forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be stored.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people who live in environments where they cannot cook can be used in the first place.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased to lipids and sugars.
Eventually, poverty becomes obese, and speaking of what we do, we can only vaguely see television, and our bodies are disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
