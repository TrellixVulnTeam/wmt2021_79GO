Driving at high heels is dangerous!
The wrong pedal accident of young people - Yahoo! News
Traffic law violations
It is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
In the number of accidents caused by pedal accident by age (2015 National Police Agency data), more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years of age.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that in the younger generation there is a misconception that music, conversation, etc. are distracted by other things, and a mistake caused by clothes.
In particular, some women choose high heels, pamps, sandals, mulles, and various shoes depending on the outfit of the day.
Some people say that it is troublesome to change clothes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but some people do not think at all that it is possible to lead to danger, and many people are driving casually.
However, high heels and sandals are in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, and Article 70 "Disclosure of safety driving obligations" as stipulated in "Do not drive to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee.For example, in Article 12 of the Ordinance on Enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, there is a statement that the driver shall not drive the vehicle (excluding light vehicles) in a manner that prevents the driver from wearing or preventing the operation of the vehicle (excluding light vehicles).
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if it is not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe pedal operation, first place the foot to the floor and place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that the car does not wear regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the area where the kakato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal becomes smaller and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is difficult to adjust.
This may lead to danger.
Most cars also have floor carpets, but this material is easily pulled by a high heel, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be trampled.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished, and the Cubs' Dalbisch pitcher 33, who finished the playoffs this season, responded to the interview, saying "I have not done anything for two days, but I'm sorry to see baseball from the bench without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses, and 398 defenses.
In particular, in the second half of the game, the pitch form was stabilized, and he continued to play against the opponent with outstanding braking force and overwhelming power.
"Now it's definitely fine in my life until now, at 33 years old, I didn't think it would be such a feeling.In spring, I thought, "I wonder if I'll end this way too," but I feel that I can't believe that I came back from there and went to a better place."
I was able to gradually respond from early June.
"The more things we can do every day, the more we can do one day."
It was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses that I set myself up one after another, it became much more and more successful.
He also became confident that he was thrown into the injured list throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, said, "I'm going to have to think about it now, I'm going to talk to my agents and family."
It is not the final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with beautiful girls in Baizuo's work? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadows?
Since the 1950s, a number of works have been sent to the world.The "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of your work.
[Image] Are you attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls in Baizuna's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "we will stand out when the beauty of the women in the extremes of fear, ugliness, and the shocking scenes and unfolds of the story is there."
There are many things that appear in Baizu Kazuo's works that have the keyword "snake," but snakes can be perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others are not good at it.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a living creature in the back.
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
In most cases, a woman with a shadow is a beautiful woman.
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ...
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work, but in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, it is reminiscent of a snake somewhere.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Aba Beer, a Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from crashed US forces.
It is inexpensive and can be operated at a distance of about 1000 km.
To fly low-flying, it is also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radar."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Dr. Sugawara, International Political Analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over.After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever." (Mr. Sugawara)
The U.S. and Iran's "substitutional war" are facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why the super personality YouTuber became a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
September 27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, some companies have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does YouTuber mean?
I interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, the CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
How does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There is also a top ranking in the career rankings where elementary school students want to get in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who pursue dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuberr Adoption" is intended to support young people who follow their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
But why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTuber is not able to generate revenue as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time jobs, and some creators who do not recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for pay and content creation to creators who are hired.
At first, we will support the demerit of YouTuber's profession, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the United States - Yahoo! News
U.S. Undersecretary for the U.S. Undersecretary of State for the Republic of Korea and Japan, Mr. Napper said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return the decision to destroy Korea in response to a single interview with the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo on the Japan-Korea Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information with Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper asserts that "the crisis cannot be effectively addressed without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill the gap."

In the first half of the competition, two of them, Kento Momota, who won two of the four championships, and Shutensei (Cho Tien Cheng) of Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship and Zhou Tensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly linked to the Olympic Games.
Momota also has Japan OP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesia OP (July/2013), the Japan OP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
A good result is needed in the mid-term battle where the top competitions since September are held.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from fighting.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year the stability of the playing field increased so that he could continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Pranys B.
He is also the third player of Anders Antonsen, who has been fighting for Europe.
Although Cantaffon did not advance to the finals, he was able to advance to the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Pranys B. also took a step back in India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, are also catching up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as a result of the revision of the Telecommunications Business Law in October.
However, it generally stopped high.
In the summer of last year, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligarchy of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fair competition that makes it easy to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to half the price.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) decided to immediately terminate the SIM lock.
The company needs to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of improvement of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected to be a detonator of low-price competition, so it looked like a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and fees of the full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I want you to take responsibility for your business.
This time, the price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to stay at all."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government prices will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price," there are cases where consumer burden exceeds half price.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users by the company itself, we must try to explain carefully and easily.
A cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
The three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture ( Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Kozuke Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on June 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawals by cash cards to prevent damage to special scams.

Transferred to Mutsu room including Yokotsuna Tsururyu | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on March 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers in the Izutsu room, including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAGI, to Mutsu room, with the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUTSU (Genseki Wakifuko).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Itsutsu room.

In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] One-shot Departure & Struggles Overseas ripples to U.S. players' "face risk tackle" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quill is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was defeated by the United States at 7-45 in England on June 26.
It was a black star, but the late Roughplay played by FLJohn Quill called the ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
Foreign media also released the actual scene with video, and former English players complained that it was "not a tack."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill
The fight was over.
The second half is 29 minutes.
In the midst of the enemy, the English commander Farrell had a little bit of a balance when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tackle.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist, and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other, and the person's head is in contact with each other.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
The English protested against the obvious lack of legitimacy in the play, as the English tried to pierce Quill.
Both players gathered at once, and the air was instantly touched.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for a fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players dropped out of poor play and England won."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and was dropped."
In the article, he introduced the comments of the commentator Hugo Mona, a former English athlete.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The United States, which had lost one game, managed to escape the final loss in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left the poor aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reviewed the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were designated: the National Hospital Organization of straw hospital in straw city, the Three Kingdoms Hospital in bushi city, the Oda hospital in bushi Echizen town, the Wakasa-Takahama hospital in .
4 hospitals to be restructured.
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote the reorganization and integration of hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we also requested a full-scale review of the reorganization and integration of the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
There is no compulsory force, but it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that a nearby hospital will disappear.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total hospital was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was higher in the order of Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that could respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, as well as whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all the baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals in 18 years to 191,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "Advanced acute" and "Acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for elderly people.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical personnel discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.

When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were established in forests and Nanae Ryocho, and residents moved by bus and police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of domestic livestock infection "Ton cholera," which would enable preventive vaccination against domesticated pigs that are not currently recognized.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods outside the region is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, the procedure will be completed in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "Voculation Recommended Area" based on the opinions of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program," which summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed, and is confirmed by the province and allowed to use it by the Governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region is determined very once again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and wastes are restricted in principle in the region.
As for meat and processed products, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
He advocates the safety of the inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defectious Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectural governments will be conducted until October 7th, and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is an open approach to Man U!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Standard Time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request for one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian edition of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article entitled "5 FWs that Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda.
Currently, United is suffering from injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, was forced to slip in the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player is not a striker, but a hole filled with Andreas Pereira."
He scored 9 goals in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory, but "The 33-year-old Honda needs to get a full attention away from his entertainment that manages the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move due to the veterans who say that the next Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
500 portable translation machines have been installed.Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, etc. | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
PokeTalk, a portable translation machine that lends free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on June 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a concentrated manner in the same region, and attention should be paid to the improvement of the ability to respond to inbound travelers.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The district covers 60% of the population.
We also started showing rentals to Google Maps, a map app, so we could see the location of a foreign language store on our smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine groups in the city under the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce purchased 500 units and lent them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of acquiring hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We want foreign customers to develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
now, don't you need to tie up your first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not necessarily tipping.
There is also a technique called "naodra," which is used to hold a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of par 5.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of falling balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in his 7th year, he is 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodra."
The ball can be dropped from the practice round to the top of the turf in the ti area, and the ball can also be sprinkled with 1W.
In the case where Big Carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but the two sides are used effectively in a narrow hall.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd with Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration from the gallery that I saw in the tactics that surprised my tour companions.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of Tipping).
The ball is not caught, and it is accompanied by risk of slices, but "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that I don't want to think about.

The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, which was first published at Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall.

"Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Greta Tunberg, a Swedish environmental activist who gave a speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Tounbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?
A political critic told Greta that he was " mentally ill and used by his parents and international left wing" on American television, and apologized to him.
In Japan, there are many reports on Greta on the Internet saying "It is used and cute" "It is better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'm going to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories.
Greta said, "Look, it started again, as you realize, those who hate me are still active, and they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, and they come to think of as far as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be distracting from the topic.
Honestly, I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I wonder if they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.

Wedgeshot of Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with the momentum in the second half, but I couldn't stretch the patter because it wasn't very good.
did you see the sixth eagle and seventh bardy win?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5.
I was able to get a chance at number 7, but I regret that I couldn't reach in the second half.
what did you get?
I didn't feel good recently (shots), so I was glad that Fairway was able to keep up even on narrow courses.
It was a course where both rough and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have much else to change, but I just co-hosted a competition where there are few Japanese players, so I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to foreign players."
It will continue in the second half of the game, but if you don't win one or more, you can't aim for the winning king, so I want to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to " forget about things"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are failing to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital We interviewed Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of the Center for stroke.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, there is a difference in the degree.
However, it is still thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as deaths from infections and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are declining due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind.
How to keep things to an extent of forgetting.
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to " forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be stored.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used in the first place.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, poverty, but obesity, and speaking of what to do, you can barely see TV, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
