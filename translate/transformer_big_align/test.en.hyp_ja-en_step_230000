Driving at high heels is dangerous!
The accident caused by the mistake of pedaling young people - Yahoo! News
violation of road traffic law
However, it is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years of age.
It is important for young people to call attention in the same way as the elderly.
do you want to take your feet?
are you safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly, which is often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, there is a possibility that in the younger generation there is a mistake due to accidental mistakes caused by music, conversation, etc.
In particular, some women choose high heels, pumps, sandals, mulles, and various shoes depending on the clothes of the day and drive them as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people say it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people do not think of the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, high heels and sandals are in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, and Article 70, "Safety driving obligation violations" which stipulates that "No driving should be done to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, the driver shall not drive the vehicle (except light vehicles) in a manner that prevents the driver from wearing or preventing the operation of the vehicle (except light vehicles).
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that could prevent driving operation" as a violation even if not specified as high-heel.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first place the foot to the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right as a branch when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that the car does not wear regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, because the height of the heel has an angle on the entire foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller and it is difficult to adjust finely.
This may lead to danger.
Most cars also have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get rid of the high heel, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be trampled.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

United States, at least 3 consecutive years, 18,000 people | Shizuoka Shimbun
The U.S. Department of State announced on October 26 that it would reduce the maximum number of refugees accepted from around the world to 18,000 in the fiscal year 2020 (October 19-20 September).
The minimum number of refugees since 1980 has been renewed for three consecutive years.
The Trump administration aims to promote strict immigration and refugee policies to the conservatives in line with the presidential election next year.
There is no need to criticize human rights groups and other organizations, as people who are forced to leave the country in various parts of the country continue to exist.
The previous Obama administration set the maximum limit for fiscal 2005 to 110,000, but the Trump administration, which was launched in January 2005, reversed this and reduced it to 50,000.
In the 18th year, it has been reduced by 45,000 people, and in the 19th year it has been reduced by 30,000 people.

This is the first time the Prime Minister of Bulgaria visited Korea.
President Moon welcomed the visit to Korea before the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year and appreciated the leadership of Prime Minister Borisov, who led the development of Bulgaria.
The two leaders shared the view that trade and investment between the two countries continued to increase while protectionist tradeism expanded globally and agreed to work together to expand economic cooperation in the future.
President Moon welcomed Bulgaria's policy to grant Korean companies the status of "strategic investors" and said that it would be hoped that Korean companies would invest in Bulgaria on the basis of this.
He also emphasized that while Bulgaria is promoting the introduction of nuclear power plants and the modernization of national defense, Korea can become the best partner of Bulgaria, and called for attention and cooperation so that Korean companies can participate in the ordering of nuclear power plants and promoting the defense industry.
In addition, the two leaders agreed to strengthen future-oriented cooperation in the battery and automotive parts sectors of electric vehicles and renewable energy.

The local industry of Hyogo-Awaji Island, Kinki ceramics manufactured by "Awaji tile" filed for quasi-self bankruptcy debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo! News
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the fact that consumers' roofs had advanced due to repeated earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Code: 530173983, capital of 9.2 million yen, Otani 881-8, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self bankruptcy at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One applicant was Daichi Yoshida (Nishitenman 1-10-8, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture, Daichi Yoshida Law Office, Tel 06-665-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present-day Minamiawaji City).
In October 1986, he succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd. as a result of the merger of Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and transferred the head office to the present location.
After that, a sales base was established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system.
In the fiscal year ended December 2004, sales of approximately 3116 million yen were recorded.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market since the Lehman shock and the severe damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, consumer demand was sluggish, and the annual sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 were down to approximately 134 million yen.
In terms of profit, in addition to the decline in profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the deficit continued to be severe due to excessive interest-bearing liabilities associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment.
For this reason, although financial institutions were trying to rebuild their business by asking financial institutions to ease the repayment conditions for borrowings, there was no signs of recovery in business conditions, and the financial situation was gradually pressing.
I couldn't help but quit the business and took this action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is expected to be about 20 billion yen.

Dalbisch summarised this season: "It's good to make a difference in my life" (East SpoWeb) - Yahoo!
[From St. Louis, Missouri (28th Japan time) ]
The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished, and the Cubs' Dalbisch pitcher 33, who finished the playoffs this season, responded to the interview, saying "I'm not doing anything for two days, but I'm sorry to see baseball from the bench without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses, and 3/98 defenses.
In particular, in the second half of the game, the ball form was stable, and he continued to play against the opponent with outstanding braking force and overwhelming power.
"Now it's definitely a big difference in my life.I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be like that.In spring, I thought, "I'm going to end this way too," but I came back from there and I feel that I can't believe myself that I can go to a better place."
I was able to gradually respond from early June.
"The more things we can do every day, the more we can do one day."
It was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses he developed one after another, his condition became much higher and his grades became better.
He also became confident that he was thrown into the injured list throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt-out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I'm going to have to think about it now, I'm going to talk with agents and family."
The final conclusion is not reached, but the feeling is firm.

[One year from the Eastern Iburi Earthquake] Water Supply at the time of power outage Hakodate Mansion: Hokkaido Shimbun
In response to the blackout caused by the Eastern Iburi Earthquake in September last year, measures have been taken in condominiums in Hakodate City, where water was cut off.
According to the city's Bureau of Enterprises, seven condominiums were installed in one year after the earthquake, and a "watering plug" was installed to allow water to be discharged even after power outages.
There are about 400 condominiums and private-sector housings in the city, which are fed by a four-story "passenger tank" that may be watered during power outages.
The house's water supply system is broadly divided into two types: a "passenger tank type" that uses water once in a water tank located in the basement or rooftop, and a "directly connected type" that directly feeds water from the city's water supply pipe to each door.
Even if the water pipe is not damaged, the electric pump that pumpes water from the water tank to each door will not move due to power failure, so the water supply will not be able to be provided and each door will be turned off.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizuna's work? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between the mysterious beauty and the expression of shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.The "Baizu Kazuo Bijoshi Collection" (Genkosha) was launched in August 2019.
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of your works.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls in Baizuna's work
In the preface of "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "we will stand out only when the beauty of the women in the extremes of fear, ugliness, and the shocking scenes and developments of the story" but because of the contrast between the beautiful face and the distortion of the face and the expression of resentment ..., more "fear" may stand out.
There are many things that appear in Baizu-no-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "beauty evil" may be a snake.
This creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is auspicious.
There are "Nabi Girls" and "Nara no Girls" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
In general, it is the market for a beautiful woman with a shadow.
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type if you put it in an imaginative way? ... I feel that it seems like it is in common with beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
In particular, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work, but in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, it is reminiscent of a snake somewhere.

why is it now a children's cafeteria?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, Chairman and social activist of Yotsu NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So he said, "We needed a place for exchange in a region where people interacted with each other."
It is a multi-generational space where elderly people also participate.
It not only eliminates solitary food, but also helps raise children and health for the elderly.
We cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that you don't have to create children from there.
There are a variety of places to offer meals every day from one month to another.
The scale varies from several to hundreds, and the venue is diverse from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people who want to do is being created.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
we've heard about issues like a safe management system
Even though it is a gyoku, "The values change by interacting with many people." "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from crashed US forces.
It can be manufactured at low cost, and its range is about 1000 km.
To fly low-flying, it is also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Dr. Sugawara, an international political analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock comes again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, I would like to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over.After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure forever, and there is enough possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "substitutional war" are facing immediate crisis.
The reason why the super personality YouTuber became a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
September 27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their products, some companies have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings for elementary school students who want to work in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams of bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, hiring young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber and trying to support them is hiring YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the job of YouTuber, most YouTuber has a reality that they can't earn as much revenue as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time jobs, and many creators who do not allow their families to recognize the existence of YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we hired.
At first, we will support the demerit of the occupation of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" Deputy U.S. Undersecretary - Yahoo! News
Deputy U.S. Undersecretary of State for Korea and Japan, Mr. Napper said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return its decision to abandon the Japan-Korea Military Information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 at the U.S. Ambassador's official residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing information on missile launches between Japan, Korea, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper said, "We can't respond effectively to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] world champion Kento Momota and strong performance Shu Tensei lead one step!
Men's singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japanese national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championship (Switzerland Basel) in badminton's Big Event in August, finished the training camp in early September and entered the Chinese OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17th.
Here, we look back at the first half of the race between May and August, when the next year's Tokyo Olympics began, and we will look forward to the men's singles in the mid-season (September to December) (Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).
Beginning in May, badminton's Olympic race took over the top four (super 500 or more) tournaments, where top athletes competed at the end of the World Championship.
In the first half, Kento Momota, who won two of the four contests, and Shutensei (Cho Tienchen) in Taiwan, were both successful.
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the World Championship with Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic race.
In addition to that, Momota also controls JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the mid-term competition from September onwards.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from fighting.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but since this year's stability in the field of play increased, it was possible to continue with good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the results of the first half of the game were Thai young Ace Cantapon and Indian Cy Praniz B.
And he is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is struggling for the European side.
Although Cantaffon did not advance to the finals at the top of the tournament, he was able to advance to the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is now able to rally against top athletes seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranys B. also took a step out of India, where he was a good player for singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, are also catching up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was introduced to the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Law.
However, it was generally stopped.
In the summer of last summer, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile phone companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to be higher.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to half as much as possible.
However, both companies can't use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) decided to require immediate termination.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the improvement of the communication network such as base stations as planned.
It was expected that it would be a detonator of the price reduction competition, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
Is there a sweetness of the outlook?
The timing and fees of the full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This time, the price revision was triggered by the comments of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's good to stay at all."
However, it does not seem that the reduction in government prices will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Enterprises should develop customer-oriented competition before they are told by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price," there are cases where consumer burden exceeds half price.
In order to avoid misunderstandings by companies themselves, we must try to explain politely and easily.
A cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Kozuke Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on September 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage from special fraud.
In the past three years, the bank has a cash card of three banks: Kuwana Mie, Kita Ise Ueno, and Kihoku, with a limit of 500,000 yen per day for depositors aged 70 and over who have never made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs.
The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be closed on October 1, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank will be lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by ATMs, including financial institutions and police officials.
After the sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu Yokotsuna | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
On August 27, the Japan Sumo Association announced that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAGI and one member of the Tokoyama family to the Mutsu room following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI (former Sekiwaki inverted hoko).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Itsutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki) was from Izutsu-shitsu and was a brother of Chikakata ITSUTSUTSU.
The Izutsu Chikakata died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others became temporary custody of the Kagamiyama room of the same gate, and future treatment was discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers, including Juryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] A one-shot dropout and a fight against a U.S. player's face-to-face dangerous tackle.
U.S. FL Quill is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tack."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was held on 26 July, and the United States, the last of its 20 participating countries, lost 7-45 in England.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FL John Quill later called a ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
Foreign media also released the actual scene with video, and former English players complained that "an insult and poor play" "not a tack."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by the U.S. representative Quill.
The fight was over.
It was 29 minutes in the second half when I arrived at 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy's attack, the English general Farrell was somewhat balanced when he caught his ally's pass.
I went to Tuckle.
However, he raised his upper body not from his waist but from his lower body, and violently hit his upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other, and the person's head is in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
The English protested against the obvious lack of legitimacy in the play, as the English tried to pierce Quill.
Both players gathered at once, and the air was instantly touched.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
The bats left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the spectators asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby union player, is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced comments from the commentator Hugo Mona, who was a former English player.
"It's an insult, a coward, not a tackle, it's a poor play," he said.
In the United States, where there was no one in the game, the U.S. managed to escape the loss by trying to win the game in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced the first name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nika.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: the National Hospital Organization of Wara City; the National Hospital Organization of Wara City; the Three Kingdoms Hospital; the Three Kingdoms Hospital; the Oda Hospital; the Oda Hospital in Echizen Town; the Wakasa Takahama Hospital.
⇒ 4 hospitals to be restructured: criteria are wrong.
In order to reduce medical costs, which are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing regions.
In October, we also requested a full-scale review of reorganization and consolidation at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
There is no compulsion force, but it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to fears that close hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that could respond to "high acute phase" for severe patients and " acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need for publicizing the hospital's name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the mass population were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 1191,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" that require nursing care and medical expenses, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that require the elderly.
To cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical professionals discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention, including the assumption of the eruption of Mt. Komagatake, roads, etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Toshima-kan River.
About 400 people from 20 organizations including roads and 3 towns participated.
The first event since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It was the first time in 18 years that local residents participated in a wide range of training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt. Komake erupted and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were established in both Mori and Nanae towns, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.
100,000 students protest against climate demonstrations in Vancouver - Yahoo! News

9 regions recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of pig cholera in livestock transmission.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefectures, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs that have been vaccinated is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products outside the region is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, the procedure will be completed in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, according to experts, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and direction of vaccination, receives the Ministry's confirmation, and allows them to use it at the governor's discretion.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga Prefectures, are promoting vaccination.
When the guidelines have been revised, the situation will be reviewed again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, ovulation, etc. are limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable for distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasure Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectural governments will be conducted until October 7th, and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.
A public approach to Manu, who is not affiliated with Keisuke Honda!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, Mr. Keisuke MF Honda, made a surprising move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda.
Currently, there are several injuries in United, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, was forced to slip in the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faced challenges in front quality.
As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill a hole filled with Andreas Pereira."
Nine goals scored in Melbourne Victory's 18 games are "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to take full attention away from his entertainment managing Cambodian representatives."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move due to the veterans who say that the next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce, and stores | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
PokeTalk, a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 units in stores and other locations in Hamamatsu City in a project to lease a portable translation machine "PokeTalk" to its member office for free.
It is said that it will be the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a concentrated manner in the same region, and it will be noted whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound travelers.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" also started showing where to rent it, so that you can see the location of a foreign language store on your smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, started in April, with nine organizations in the city receiving the Declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We want foreign customers to develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
right now, you don't need to hit the first hit, right?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not necessarily tiring.
For example, if you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of the par5, you need to hit the ball on the ground, so-called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which is associated with the risk of scattering balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year of professional career, he was 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he said, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodora."
The ball can be dropped from the practice round to the top of the lawn of the ti area, and the ball can be easily sprinkled 1W.
In the case where big carrie is required, a lot of tiup is used, but both sides are used effectively in a narrow hall.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd with Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of lamenting leaking from the gallery that I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if you hit the lower blow, you can't fly straight.When you hit the upper, you go right with the cut track.I was originally doing a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tiup).
The ball is not caught, and it is accompanied by risk of slices, but "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that I can't help but think about.

On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'm going to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories.
Greta says, "As you notice, people who hate me are as active as ever, as they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come to think of as far as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to ignore the topic.
Honestly, I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if people like that change, they don't like it.
Friday, see you on the street!
On Friday 20th, the previous week, climate change strikes were held in New York and other parts of the world.

I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought that I could go with the momentum in the second half, but I couldn't stretch the patter because it didn't work well.
did you see the sixth eagle, seventh bardy?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I tried to get back, the chip-in eagle on No. 6 came.
No. 7 was a chance, but I regretted that I couldn't reach it later.
what did you get at this tournament?
I didn't feel good recently (shots), so I was glad that Fairway was able to keep a tight course.
It was a course where both the rough and the reverse were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but the gallery was filming videos.
There wasn't much else that changed, but since there were only a few Japanese players co-hosted, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to overseas players."
It will continue in the second half of the game, but if you do not win one or more, you should not aim for the winning king, so I would like to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to "remember" degree?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that it is possible to remain extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital We interviewed Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of the Center for Stroke.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug called Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as death from infectious diseases and accidents is decreasing and cancer death is decreasing due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer agents.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
We need to create an environment where people can live with peace of mind in the community as a whole.
how to keep things to an extent
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that the symptoms can be suppressed as much as possible and kept to the degree of " forgetting things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, there are regions in the United States that distribute food tickets to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where cooking is not possible can be used in the first place.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, poverty, but obesity, and speaking of doing things, you can only see the TV vaguely, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can also be in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
