Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving young people pedaling multiple times - Yahoo! News
Violations against road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years of age.
It is important for young people to call attention in the same way.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly, which is often thought to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that in the young age, there is a sudden mistake caused by other things such as music and conversation, or a mistake caused by clothes.
In particular, some women choose various shoes and drive them as they wear high heels, pamps, sandals and mulles.
While some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change the shoes, but some people do not think of the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people are driving casually.
However, high heels and sandals are in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and Article 70 "Prohibition of safety driving obligations" which stipulates that "no driving should be done to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, "Don't wear shoes in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle or prevents the operation of the vehicle (excluding light vehicles).
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if it is not specified as high heels.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, the foot is fixed to the floor and the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it doesn't break regardless of car behavior.
However, because the height of the heel has an angle on the entire foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal becomes smaller and it is difficult to adjust finely.
This may lead to danger.
Most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get stuck with a high heel, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be trampled.
In addition, there is a case where the heel pulls back to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

I came here and couldn't help but abandoned the business continuity and this was the measure.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between mysterious beauty and the expression of shadow?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.The "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of your work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls in Baizu-no-Yu's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a sentence that "we stand out only when the beauty of these women is extreme, such as fear, ugliness, and the shocking scenes and developments of the story."
There are many things that appear in Baizu Kazuo's works that have the keyword "snake," but snakes can be perceived as creepy creatures by the viewer, or people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, by the sensibility of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be the living creatures in the back.
This creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mamagawa Kowai!."
In most cases, it is a beautiful woman with a shadow.
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ... I feel like it is in common with beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Of particular note, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work.

Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So he said, "We needed an exchange center in the area where people interacted with each other."
It is a multi-generational place where elderly people also participate.
Not only is it possible to eliminate solitary food, but it also provides support for raising children and health for the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that we don't create children that are left behind.
There are various places where meals are served every day from one month to another.
The venue is diverse from several to several hundred people, from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people who want to do is being created.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
we've heard about issues like secure management.
Yuasa says, "By engaging with many people, values change."
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

"In recent years, Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from the crashed US military.
It can be manufactured at low cost, and its range is approximately 1000 km.
It is also a strength that it is difficult to catch radar because it flies low."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Dr. Sugawara, an international political analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over," said Mr. Sugawara, "Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi, but the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" are facing immediate crisis.
The reason why the super personality YouTuber became a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me.
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, some companies have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is adopted as regular employees in their company.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and the number of young people who are aiming for will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams of bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "Youtuber adoption" to recruit young people who are chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the profession of YouTuber, most YouTuber is not able to generate revenue as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time jobs, and many creators who don't recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to creators who have adopted it.
At first, we would like to support the demerits of YouTuber's profession that will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary - Yahoo! News
Deputy U.S. Undersecretary of State for the Republic of Korea and Japan, Napper said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return the decision to destroy the Japan-Korea Military Information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information with Japan, Korea, the United States, and Korea.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework to protect military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper asserts that "the crisis cannot be effectively addressed without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill the gap."

From 2000 to FY18, the following year of the critical accident in Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture, which was the first time in Japan's history of nuclear power, 336 incidents of accidents and failures occurred in nuclear facilities across the country were reported.
20 years in 30 days from the critical accident that alarmed the safety myth of the nuclear industry.

Mitsukazu Soda, who completes the story and original drawings of creative picture books, and is seeking donations for publication, said on September 18 in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture.
Koichi Soda (64), an artist in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, launched a crowdfunding campaign aimed at publishing creative picture books inspired by local legends.
Mr. Soda, who was born in Hokkaido and started working as a cooperative unit in April this year, says, "I want to convey the compassion of the people of Fukui based on deep faith through picture books."
To convey Fukui's heart.
Mr. Soda is active as an artist working on contemporary art with mathematical motifs, but after the return of the calendar, he is also active as a collaborator.
After working on community development in Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi, he joined Echizen City in April this year.
It is located in the city where Kako Riko and Iwasaki Chihiro were produced, and aims to create a town using picture books.
Mr. Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion that I could understand for the first time."
What attracted attention was the legend of Awara City, "The Face of the Wife Odoshi Oni."
It is a story that she continues to recite Nenbutsu to help her mother, without worrying about the fact that she was surprised by her face.
"I forgot my hatred and returned with compassion and kindness, and felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people of Fukui."
With a hint, Soda went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived and interviewed him about his original picture book.
In June, he drew 10 scenes with warm watercolors by taking advantage of his main job.
In addition, Echizen Washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City, will be used to cover picture books with Japanese paper.
Through reading and listening, parents and children can enjoy the touch of Japanese paper.
In order to publish 600 copies, the goal of the donation is 850,000 yen.
The deadline is October 25.
Mr. Soda said, "The heart of Fukui, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud of all over Japan.
I want to convey the true kindness and compassion that children have inherited through picture books."
It is one of the projects that Fukui Prefecture has certified 11 projects for regional revitalization that are challenged by local cooperatives and business operators in the prefecture, and uses the hometown tax to support them.
The Fukui Shimbun provides information and the Fukui Bank cooperates with management support.
It can be donated from the crowdfunding site Lady For.

The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has a character from October 4 (fra den 4. oktober).
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, personally, the feature I would like to try most on macOS Catalina is Sidecar.
This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and it is a function that was previously realized by third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better at perfection (or response).
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next generation of macOS.

Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was only one of the World Championships, fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
It is expected that the best results will be in the middle of a series of high-level competitions since September.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from repeated battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the play increased so that he could continue his good performance.
To Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
Other than these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Planet B.
And he is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone in Europe.
Although Cantaffon did not advance to the finals at the top level, he was able to advance to the top level by entering the top 4 in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is now able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranys B. also took a step out of India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, will be catching up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released in October following the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it generally stopped high.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga, Secretary of State, said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations of price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fair competition that makes it easy to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile phone companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize and half the device.
However, both companies can't use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected to be a detonator of lower price competition, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and rates of full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision led to the comments of the Chief Cabinet Secretary Kan.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to stay at all."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government prices will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half," there are cases where the burden of consumers exceeds half.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, companies must carefully and easily explain.

In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] One-shot Departure & Struggles Overseas ripples to the US player's "face risk tackle" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quill is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan was the last game to be played in 20 countries.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FL John Quill in the latter half called a ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
Foreign media also released the actual scene with video, and former English players complained that it was "an insult and a cowardly play."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill.
A hot fight broke out.
It is the second half 29 minutes that I received at 0-38.
In the middle of the battle, the English captain Farrell lost his balance when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tackle.
However, he caused the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other, and the person's head is in the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
The English protested against the obvious lack of legitimacy in the play, as the English would attempt to penetrate Quill.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an immediate air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced the comments of the commentator Hugo Mona on former England players.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The U.S. lost one game, and the U.S. managed to escape the end of the game with an intentional try of 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste behind.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nika.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: the National Hospital Organization of Wara City; the National Hospital Organization of Wara City; the Three Kingdoms Hospital; the Oda Hospital of Echizen-cho; the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital; and the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital.
four hospitals to be restructured.
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and consolidation at the target hospital, and we would like to conclude by September next year.
There is no compulsion force, but it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that close hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53, 7%), Hokkaido (48, 6%), Miyagi (47, 5%), Yamaguchi (46, 7%) and Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of participants was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals for "high acute phase" for severe patients and " acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medicine, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need for publicizing the hospital's name.
The hospital is expected to be closed and some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all the baby boomers were over 75 years old.
As a result, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 19.11,000 in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for elderly people.
To cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital that has little experience.

On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Watari Island tube.
Approximately 400 people from 20 organizations, including roads and three towns, participated.

It was the first time in 18 years that local residents participated in extensive training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were established in both Mori and Nanae towns, and residents moved by bus and police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 regions recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo!
On March 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of domestic livestock infection "Ton cholera."
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefectures, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs, which are vaccinated, is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is permitted outside the region.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has temporarily suspended its status as a clean country.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, according to experts, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed, and receives the approval of the province and allows it to be used by the governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region is extremely determined again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulation are generally restricted to the region.
As for meat and processed products, it is not targeted based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He advocates the safety of the inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Protection Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new preventive guidelines will be implemented.
Unaffiliated Keisuke Honda, an open approach to Man U!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo!
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
He left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League last season, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, was surprised.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United may seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda.
Currently, there are several injuries in United, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malsal, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Ole Gunner Suhlshal, was forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faced challenges in the quality of the front line.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
"The 33-year-old Honda needs to take full attention away from his entertainment that manages the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move due to the veterans who say that the next Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
Completed installation of 500 portable translators Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and shops | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that lends free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member office, including stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a centralized manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound travelers.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations and 134 others.
It occupies 60% of the city.
The map app "Google Map" has also started showing where to rent a Google Map.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan of PoketTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce purchases 500 units and lends them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I would like to connect with the development of new foreign customers while the business environment is severe."
now, don't you need to tie up your first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not necessarily tipping.
For example, if you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of the par 5, you can hit the ball on the ground and use the technique called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of scattering the ball, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in her seventh year of professional career, she is 166 cm tall and is currently seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he said, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I wanted to try Naodora."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of the ti area, and it is sometimes sprinkled with 1W.
In cases where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd with Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration that leak from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even if you hit a down blow on the upper, you can't fly straight.I'm going to the right with a cut track.I was originally doing a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tiup).
The ball is not caught, and it is accompanied by a risk of slices, but "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional skill that I can't help but think of.

His manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa was published for the first time.
The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, which was first published at the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Museum.
Writer Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) published his essay "Shoku Bunshimura Memorial Museum in Kita Ward, Tokyo" which he published in his last years of fighting literary theory with Junichiro Tanizaki.

"Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Greta Tunberg, a Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Tounbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?
Political commentators said Greta was " mentally ill and used by parents and international leftists" on American television and apologized to the television station.
On the Internet in Japan, there are many reports that commenting on the part that Greta is not talking about, such as "It is used and cute" "It is better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on Twitter, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'm going to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories.
Greta says, "As you realize, the people who hate me are as active as ever: my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and I follow different places, they come to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that the adults did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be ignoring the issue of the story.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.
Friday, see you on the street!
On Friday 20th, the previous week, a global climate change strike was held in New York and elsewhere.

did you see the sixth eagle and seventh bardy win?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip-in-eagle on No. 6 came.
But I was frustrated that I couldn't reach it later.
what did you get in this tournament?
I didn't feel good recently (shots), so I was glad that the fairway was able to keep a tight course.
It was a course where rough and reverse eyes were broken and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but the gallery was filming videos.
I didn't have much else to change, but since there are few Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to overseas players."
It will continue in the second half of the game, but if you do not win more than one, you should not aim for the winning king, so I would like to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of forgetting?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Professor Shunsuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries overseas, the drug Dnepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and cancer deaths are also decreasing due to drastic advances in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible for individuals and families to solve this problem, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind.
How to keep things to an extent of forgetting.
Is there anyone who is easy to become dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to " forget things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used in the first place.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, poverty becomes obese, and speaking of what to do, I can only watch TV vaguely, and my body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can be in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
