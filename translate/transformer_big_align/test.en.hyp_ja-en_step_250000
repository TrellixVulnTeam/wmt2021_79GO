Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving young people mistake pedals - Yahoo! News
Violation of road traffic laws
However, it is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases were in the age of 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years of age.
It is important to call attention to young people as well as to the elderly.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly, which is often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that the young age group may be misled by other things such as music and conversation, or trampled due to clothes.
In particular, some women choose high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulles and choose various shoes according to their clothes that day and drive them as they are.
While some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people do not think of the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without hesitation.
However, driving on high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, and Article 70 "Prohibition of safety driving obligations" which stipulates that the operation should not be carried out to cause accidents and harm people.
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, "Don't drive a vehicle (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents or hinders driving operations, such as wearing shoes, slippers, high heels, etc.
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if not specified as high heels.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first place the foot to the floor, put the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right as a starting point when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not break regardless of the car's behavior.
However, in high heels, the area where the kakato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area of the foot which is grounded on the pedal is smaller and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is difficult to adjust.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to get rid of the high heels, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heels are pulled and the pedals cannot be trampled, or the heels are removed from the beats that are pulled, and the heels are stuck in the back of the pedals and cannot be stepped.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished, and the Cubs' Dalbisch pitcher 33, who finished the playoffs this season, responded to the interview, saying "I'm not doing anything for two days, but I'm sorry to see baseball from the bench without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses, 3 98 defenses, and 229 strikeouts with 178 throws.
Especially in the second half of the game, the pitch form stabilized and continued to play the opponent with outstanding braking force and overwhelming power.
"Now it's definitely a big difference in my life.I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be that kind of feeling.In spring, I thought "I'm going to end this way too," but I came back from there and felt that I couldn't believe myself that I could go to a better place."

It is not the final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

In response to the blackout caused by the Eastern Iburi Earthquake in September last year, measures have been taken in condominiums in Hakodate City where water was cut off.
According to the City Bureau of Enterprises, seven condominiums were installed in one year after the earthquake, and a "watering plug" was installed that could produce water even after power outages.
There are about 400 condominiums and private residences in the city that provide water with a "passenger tank" that can be watered at the time of power outage.
The house's water supply system is roughly divided into two types: the "passenger tank type" that is used to feed water into the water tank once underground or on the roof, and the "direct connection type" that directly feeds water from the city's water supply pipe to each door.
Even if the water pipe is not damaged, the electric pumps that pump water from the water tank to each door will not move due to power failure, so the water supply will not be able to be provided and each door will be dehydrated.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between mysterious beauty and the expression of shadow?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.The "Baizu Kazuo Girl Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear."
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
5 beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "we can stand out because of the beauty of the women in the extremes of fear, ugliness, and the shocking scenes and developments of the story."
There are many things that appear in Baizu Kazuo's works that have the keyword "snake," but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as those seen as "a creepy creature" or those who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, by the sensibility of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "The Little Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
Generally, it is the market for beautiful women with shadows to become "Hebi-nyo."
I wonder if it is a "cool beauty" type if you put it in an imaginative way ... I feel like it is in common with beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Shonen Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work.

The number increased by one to six times compared to 2018, and there were 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by nine compared to last year.
why is it now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, chairman and social activist of Yotsu NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So he said, "We needed a place for exchange in a region where people interacted with each other."
It is a multi-generational place where elderly people also participate, even if it is a gyoko shokudou.
It not only eliminates solitary food, but also helps raise children and health for the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
what's important is that we don't create children
There are various places where meals are served every day from one month to another.
The scale varies from several to hundreds, and the venue is diverse from individual homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people who want to do is being created.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
i've heard about issues like a safe management system
Even though it is gyoku, "By interacting with many people, values change." "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

As Nike Women's Footwear Senior Creative Director Georgena James says, "Women are diverse and seek something different from others," an update is added based on her experience in the collection "The One Reimagined" (launched in 2018), which redesigns sneakers from a female perspective.
[Image] Eight new models of "Air Force 1" appeared one after another, including NBA collaboration and Goretex models.
"Air Force 1 NBA Pack," a collaboration with the NBA, appeared in two types: low-cut and high-cut.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from the US military that crashed.
It can be manufactured at low cost, and its range is approximately 1000 km.
It's also the advantage that it's hard to catch radar because it flies low."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo crude oil against Iran, we aim to inform the international community that the pain in response to it will be accompanied by."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over.After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" are facing immediate crisis.
The reason why the super personality YouTuber became a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "YouTuber Adoption" that employs them as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of corporate CRM.
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX and Representative Director of Staff First, a subsidiary adopted by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi: The occupation of YouTuber is now a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to get in the future, and there will be more and more young people aiming for in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams of bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "YouTuber Adoption" to recruit young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for the job of YouTuber, most YouTuber is not able to generate revenue as expected.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time jobs, and many creators who do not allow their family to be YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we hired.
At first, we will support the demerit of YouTuber, a profession that will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary - Yahoo! News
U.S. Undersecretary of State for the U.S. Mr. Napper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Republic of Korea and Japan, said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return the decision to destroy the Japan-Korea Military Information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 at the Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing information on missile launches between Japan, Korea, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework to protect military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper claimed, "We cannot respond effectively to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill the gap."

Big Camera Okayama Ekimae store selling large-scale home appliances before tax increases
On the 28th, the last weekend before the consumption tax hike, from 8% to 10%, we visited home appliance retailers and supermarkets in Okayama Prefecture.
There is also a home center that develops a special selling place to buy a summary, and a suit store that sells winter clothing in advance, and each shop is focusing on selling.
At the Big Camera Okayama Ekimae store (Kita Ward, Okayama City Ekimae-cho), there is a sale with a limited price until 30 days.

According to the store, in September, large-scale home appliances such as television, washing machines and refrigerators increased, and sales were about twice that of the previous year.
"The rush demand is beyond imagination, and in the second half, customers who demand expensive goods stand out."
The sale of the suit sold by Haruyama Shoji Co., Ltd. (Omote-cho), which is said to be "a large-scale payment immediately before the tax increase."
This month's sales increased by 10% compared to the previous year.
A company employee who visited Kurashiki store (Shiraraku-cho, Kurashiki City) to buy a suit to wear in an adult ceremony (19) = Asaguchi City = "The ceremony is still ahead, but I want to buy it before the tax increase."
In this tax increase, the tax rate of drinking food and other foodstuffs is set in the reduction tax rate system, so the home center and supermarket will focus on daily necessities and sake.
At the time-takaya store in the home center (Kamimoto, Naka Ward, Okayama City), a special corner with large capacity detergent and tissue is located near the entrance.
Sales of daily consumables increased by one or six times compared to the same month of the previous year, and "If you do not replenish again and again on a day, you will be cut off" (Seiya Shimizu store manager).
The public servant man (63) of the city who visited the shop said, "Because it is something to buy, this opportunity is an opportunity."
Tenmanya Happi Town Okanan Store (Michiko Shinmachi, Minami Ward, Tokyo) will also install wagons with detergents, toilet paper and paper diapers at the event hall.
The city's corporate man (35) said, "If you receive a cashless payment point reduction, the burden will hardly change, so you will not buy daily necessities in a hurry."

Crop didn't get lost about the best moment of 2019 "It's a reversal in the Barcelona match, and many experts and myself wouldn't have been betting on us even one centimetre in 3-0 in Bihadin against teammates with Messi and Suárez.
Finally, Crop, who received more personal questions, said, "When I blessed the Bundesliga championship, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was, this time I didn't happen, because I was a man suffering from the obsession of self-management, I don't like to get drunk.I remember everything, if I put everyone in front of me, I might be able to distinguish everyone from the bus."

According to Apple, macOS Catalina, a new OS that will be launched in October.
That specific date is not revealed, but maybe it will be delivered on October 4.
[Look at all images] The release date of macOS Catalina may be October 4th?
The above image was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has a character from October 4 (fra den 4. oktober).
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, I personally want to try the most feature on macOS Catalina "Sidecar."
This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and it is a function that has traditionally been realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better at perfection (or response).
There are rumors about the upcoming MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next generation of macOS.

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] world champion Kento Momota and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
Men's singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, badminton's big event in August, completed a training camp in early September and participated in the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17th.
Here, we will look back at the first half of the tournament from May to August, when the Tokyo Olympic Games were held next year, and we will look forward to the men's singles in the middle race (September to December).
Beginning in May, badminton's Olympic race took place at the end of the World Championships, where top athletes competed in the Super 500 or more.
In the first half, Kento Momota, who won two of the four contests, and Shutensei (Cho Tienchen) of Taiwan, were both successful.
Momota won the World Championships and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July), and World Championships (August).
Compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was only one of the World Championships, fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
There is a need for good results in mid-term matches that have been held since September.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from consecutive battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
Although Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, the stability of the playing field increased this year, and it became possible to continue good grades firmly.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
Other than these two players, the results of the first half of the game were Thai young Ace Cantafone and Indian Cy Praniz B.
And he is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is struggling as a European.
Although Cantaffon did not advance to the finals at the top level, he was able to advance to the top level by entering the top 4 in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is now able to rally against top athletes seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranys B. also took a step out of India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will also be driving up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as a result of the revision of the Telecommunications Business Law in October.
However, it generally stopped high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40 percent," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fair competition that makes them easy to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal fee, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to half the price.
However, both companies can't use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
As for SIM locking, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate cancellation.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of improvement of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected to be a detonator of lower price competition, so it looked like a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for the business.
This time, the price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's going to be okay."
However, the reduction in government-made prices does not seem to distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
The company should develop customer-oriented competition before it is announced by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price," there are cases where the consumer burden exceeds half price.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users by the company itself, it is necessary to make careful and easy-to-understand explanations.
Reduced withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Kozuke Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on June 26 that they decided to reduce the amount of withdrawals by cash cards to prevent damage to special scams.
In the past three years, the bank holds cash cards from three banks: Kuwana Mie, Kita Ise Ueno, and Kihoku, with a maximum amount of 500,000 yen per day for depositors over 70 years old who have never made a certain amount of withdrawal transactions at ATMs.
The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be lowered on October 1, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank will be lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by ATMs, such as financial institutions and police officials, and those involved in the Shinkin Bank say "I want to protect your important deposits in the manner possible."
Transferred to Mutsu room including Tsururyu Yokozuna | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room, including Tsururyu YOKOTSUTSUNAGI, to the Mutsu room with the death of Chikakata ITSUTSUKI (Genseki Wakikobo).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Ozeki Kirishima), was a brother of Chikakata ITSUTSU from the Izutsu room.
The Izutsu Chikakata died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the same Kagamiyama room, and future treatment was discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers, including Juryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[Rogue W Cup] One-shot Departure & Struggle Overseas ripples to "face risk tackle" of U.S. players " insulting and poor play" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quill is a rough play, former England representative "not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was the last game to be played in 20 countries, and the United States finished 7-45 in England.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FL John Quill in the latter half called a ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
Foreign media also released the actual scene with video, and former English athletes complained that "an insult and a cowardly play" "not a tack."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The real moment of "face risk tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill.
A hot fight broke out.
It is the second half 29 minutes that I received at 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy, the English captain Farrell was somewhat balanced when he caught his ally's pass.
I went to Tackle.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other, and they are in a shape that looks like a head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
A fierce protest was made by English players against the obvious lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill exits with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked him to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out in poor play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and was dropped."
In the article, he introduced comments from former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play," he said.
In the United States, where only one game was played, the United States managed to escape the capitulation in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced the first name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan, which judged that their medical records were poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awara Hospital, the National Hospital Organization of Wara City, and Awara Hospital, the Three Kingdoms Hospital of Wicked Echizen-cho Oda Hospital, the Wakasa Takahama Hospital of Wicked Takahama-cho.
⇒ 4 hospitals to be reorganized "Standard Funny"
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing regions.
In October, we would like to request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and conclude by September next year.
There is no compulsion force, but it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to fears that close hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total hospital was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent) and Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The target hospital will be considered to be abolished and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all the baby boomers were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 19.11,000 beds in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds in the "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are carefully placed and medical expenses are paid, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for elderly people.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain a cautious attitude and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention, such as the assumption of eruption of Mt.Komagatake, road etc.
On September 27th, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forests, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Watari Island tube.
About 400 people from 20 organizations including roads and 3 towns participated.
The first event since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It was the first time in 18 years that local residents participated in the extensive training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in both Mori and Nanae towns, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.

9 regions recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of domestic pig cholera.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs that have been vaccinated is restricted to the region, but distribution of meat and processed foods outside the region is permitted.
It aims to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible through public comments to the general public.
By using vaccines and recognizing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program," which summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed, receives the approval of the province, and permits use by the governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region is extremely determined again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and wastes are restricted in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
He also advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasure Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Keisuke Honda, an open approach to Manu!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The opponent who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article entitled "5 FWs that Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up to be currently available.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda.
Currently, U.S. casualties include MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Malcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, is forced to slip into the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faces challenges in the quality of the front lines.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
9 points scored in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory are "hard records," but it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to take full attention away from his entertainment managing Cambodian representatives."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move due to the veterans who announce that they will be participating in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
500 portable translators completed installation Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and shops | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
PokeTalk, a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy this translator in a concentrated manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
We started to show where to rent Google Map, a map app, so we could see the location of a foreign language store on a smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area website.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city under the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We want to help foreign customers develop new customers while the business environment is severe."
right now, do you need to tie up the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not necessarily tipping.
For example, if you want to earn a distance by hitting the second part of the par 5, you can hit the ball on the ground and use the so-called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which entails the risk of scattering balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Hiroyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24 in her seventh year of professional career, she is 166 cm tall and is currently ranked seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I thought I would try Naodra."
The ball is dropped from the practice round to the top of the grass in the ti area, and sometimes swings 1W.
In cases where big carrie is required, a lot of tiup is used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd in Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
The ball is not caught, and it is accompanied by risk of slices, but "So the left side can be erased (not bent on the left).
It's a professional technique that I can't help but think of.

The original manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa was published for the first time.
The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published at the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall.

Greta Tounberg, a Swedish environmental activist who spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Tounbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?
Political commentators said Greta was " mentally ill and used by parents and international leftists" on American television and apologized.
On the Internet in Japan, there are a lot of reports on Greta's comments, such as "It's used and cute" and "It's better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'm going to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories.
Greta said, "Look, it started again, as you notice, those who hate me are still active, as I follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come to think of as long as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be distracting from the topic.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if adults like the change, they don't like it.
Friday, see you on the street!
On Friday, the previous week, a global climate change strike was held in New York and elsewhere.
Greta called on to do it on Friday 27th.

Wedgeshot of Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not able to stretch well.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I tried to get back, the chip-in eagle on No. 6 came.
But I regretted that I couldn't reach in the second half.
what did you get?
Recently (shots) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I was able to properly keep the fairway on a narrow course.
I learned a lot because I didn't have much experience.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
I didn't have much change other than that, but since there are fewer Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to foreign players."
We will continue in the second half of the game, but if we don't win more than one, we don't want to aim for the winning king.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of forgetting?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with research and development challenges.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Professor Shunsuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as death from infectious diseases and accidents is decreasing and cancer death is also decreasing due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible for individuals and families to solve this problem, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things forgotten
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki: Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to " forget things."
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be stored.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used in the first place.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and sugars.
When it comes to poverty, it becomes obese, and when it comes to doing it, you can only vaguely watch TV, and your body becomes disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books and think about things from day to day.
