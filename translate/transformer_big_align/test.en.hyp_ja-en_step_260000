Driving at high heels is dangerous!
There have been many accidents involving young people pedaling wrong - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that elderly drivers are the only problem.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years of age.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that in the young age, there is a faint mistake due to music, conversation, etc.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on the day's clothing, such as high heels, pamps, sandals and mulles, and drive them as they are.
While some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people do not think of the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and many people drive without worrying.
However, high heels and sandals are in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and Article 70 "Contrary to safety driving obligations" which stipulates that "no driving should be done to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, "Don't drive a vehicle (except light vehicles) by wearing shoes in such a way that it may interfere with driving operations or prevent driving operations."
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if not specified as high heels.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safety-responsible pedal operation, the foot is fixed on the floor, the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the foot is tilted to the right as a starting point.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not shake regardless of car behavior.
However, since the height of the heel has an angle on the entire foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller, making it difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
Most cars also have floor carpets, but this material makes it easy to pull a high heel, and when it comes to emergency braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be trampled.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

I couldn't help but quit the business and took this action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be around 2 billion yen.

The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished, and the Cubs' Dalbisch pitcher 33, who finished the field this season, responded to the interview, saying "I have not done anything for two days, but I'm sorry to see baseball from the bench without any purpose."
This season, he started 31 games with 6 wins, 8 losses, 398 defenses, and 229 strikeouts with 178 throws.
Especially in the second half of the game, the pitch form was stable, and he continued to play with the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming power.
"I was 33 years old, and I didn't think it would be that kind of feeling.In spring, I thought "I'm going to end this way too," but I came back from there and I feel I can't believe I was able to go to a better place."
From around early June, I gradually learned how to respond.
"The number of things we can do every day has increased, and the number of things we can do every day has increased."
There was trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses one after another, the state became much more and more successful.
He was also confident that he had been thrown into the list of wounded throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "I'm going to have to think about it now, I'm going to talk with agents and family."
It is not the final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

In response to water treatment after purifying contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, Mr. Yoshiaki Harada, Minister of Environment, and Mr. Ichiro Matsui, Mayor of Osaka City, said, "The Kellen-tasting debate is a problem, and the position of opposition to ocean emissions remains unchanged."
In discussing the full-scale operation, Chairman Akira Egawa of Iwaki City Fisheries Cooperative pointed out that "it is necessary to suck up opinions from the bottom," and expressed respect for the intentions of the union members.
It is said that the Board of Directors, which consists of branch offices, resolves each issue and concludes as a city fishing cooperative.
Mr. Kanji Tachiya, president of Soma Futaba Fisheries Co., Ltd. said, "In addition to fishermen, it is necessary to discuss with the brokers."

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls in Baizuna's work? - Yahoo! News
Is there anything in common between mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) has been released in August 2019.
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear."
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls in Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "if there is a beauty of the women in the opposite extremes of fear, ugliness, and shocking scenes and developments of the story, they will stand out."
There are many things that appear in Baizu Kazuo's works that are called "swords," but snakes can be perceived as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or people who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others are not good at it.
In this way, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a spiritual creature since ancient times.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
In most cases, a woman with a shadow is a beautiful woman.
Is it an immaculate way to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ... I feel like it is in common with beautiful girls appearing in Baizu work.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work.

Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So he said, "We needed a place for exchange in a region where people interacted with each other."
It is a multi-generational exchange place where elderly people participate.
It not only eliminates solitary food, but also provides support for child rearing and health for the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that you don't have to create a child that will be born out of it.
There are various places where meals are served every day from one month to another.
The scale varies from several to hundreds, and the venue is diverse from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people who want to do is being created.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
we're also hearing the challenges of safe management.

"In recent years, Aba Beer, a Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from crashed US forces.
It can be manufactured at low cost, and its range is about 1000 km.
The advantage is that it is difficult to catch radar because it flies low."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo crude oil against Iran, we aim to inform the international community that it will suffer accordingly."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over.After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones on the cover of the Fusi factions, but the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "substitutional war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I ask the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 delivery
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption" that they employ as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX and representative of the company's first staff, which was actually adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
How do you get YouTuber?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are also on top of the job rankings they want to get in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams of bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "Youtuber adoption" to recruit young people who are chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTubers have the reality of not being able to generate revenue as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who can't recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to the creators we hired.
At first, we will support the demerit of the occupation of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary - Yahoo! News
U.S. Undersecretary of State for the Republic of Korea and Japan, Mr. Napper said on November 27, at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, he would like to reconsider and return Korea's decision to destroy Japan and Korea's military information comprehensive protection agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information with Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework to protect military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper claimed, "We can't effectively respond to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try most on macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and it is a function that was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's genuine function, it is expected that it is better at perfection (or response).
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next generation of macOS.

The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was only one of the world championships, fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the mid-term competition from September onwards.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.

Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from consecutive battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament by winning a high point in the first half.
Although Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, the stability of the playing field increased in this year, allowing him to continue his good grades.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
Other than these two players, the results of the first half of the game were Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Pranith B.
And he is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone in Europe.
Although Cantaffon did not advance to the finals at the top level, he was able to advance to the top level by entering the top 4 in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranith B. also took a step out of India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Prnoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who had been late due to injury, are also catching up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reductions in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as a result of the revision of the Telecommunications Business Law in October.
However, it generally stopped high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer that "there is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
The major factor is that the full-scale entry into Rakuten has been postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to half the price.
However, both companies can't use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications mandated that the SIM lock be terminated immediately.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of maintenance of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected to be a detonator of lower price competition, so it looked like a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of the full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for the business.
This time, the price revision was triggered by the remarks of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's going to be okay."
However, it does not seem that the government-made price reduction will distort the market and promote healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
Each company's pricing system is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price," there are cases where the consumer burden exceeds half price.
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by themselves.

[Rogue W Cup] One-shot Departure & Struggles Overseas ripples for U.S. players' "face risk tackle" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quill is a rough play and former England representative, "It's not a tack."
The Rugby World Cup Japan was the last game to be played in 20 countries, and the United States finished 7-45 in England.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FLJohn Quill in the latter half called a ripple.
He leaves with a shoulder tuck on his face.
A video of the actual scene was also made available to foreign media, and former English players complained that "an insult and poor play" "not a tack."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The actual moment of "face risk tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill.
A hot fight broke out.
It is the second half 29 minutes that I received at 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy, the English commander Farrell had a somewhat balanced encounter with his allies.
I went to Tackle.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other, and they are in the shape of a head.
Farrell was devastated and collapsed.
A fierce protest was made that English players would fly through Quill, apparently lacking legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked him to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" is featured in the headline "Rogue World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out in poor play, England wins."
"Kill had a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and he left."
In the article, he introduced a comment by former English commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the final defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the poor aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "the standards are strange."
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, we would like to request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and conclude by September next year.
There is no compulsion force, but it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that close hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent) and Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of participants was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals for "altitude acute phase" and "acute phase" for severe patients.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether a competing hospital could be located within 20 minutes by car.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in hospitals with 1246,000 beds (18 years) nationwide to 191,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds for "altitude acute" and "acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for elderly people.
To cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical personnel discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention, including the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komagatake, roads, etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Watari Island tube.

At 8:45 a.m., Mt. Komaga erupted and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were established in both Mori and Nanae towns, and residents moved by bus and police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 prefectures recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of pig cholera, an infectious disease of livestock, which is not currently recognized.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs that have been vaccinated is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods outside the region is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, the procedure will be completed in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, according to experts, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed, and receives the approval of the Ministry, and permits the use by the Governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region is extremely determined again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and wastes are restricted in principle in the region.
For meat and processed products, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is practically acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
He advocates the safety of inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7, and new anti-defection guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Keisuke Honda, a public approach to Manu!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "5 FWs Manchester United may have caught in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda.
At present, United is suffering from injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Surshal, was forced to slip in the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faced challenges in front quality.
As a result, Honda was named as a candidate for a new force for Teko.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player is not a striker, but a hole filled with Andreas Pereira."
Nine goals scored in the Melbourne Victory 18 games were "a solid record," but it is also pointed out that Honda, 33 years old, needs to take full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team.
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also worth noting that United will move due to the veterans who announce that they will be participating in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
500 portable translators completed installation Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
"PokeTalk" is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machine "PokeTalk" at its member office.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy this translator in a centralized manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound (travelers to Japan).
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The district covers 60% of the population.
The map app "Google Map" also started showing where to rent, so that you can see the location of "stores for foreign languages" on your smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city under the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I hope that the business environment is severe and will lead to the development of new foreign customers."
now, don't you need to tie up your first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not necessarily tiring.
For example, if you want to earn a distance with a second hit of par 5, you can hit a ball on the ground and use the so-called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves the risk of falling balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year of professional career, he was 166 cm in height and is currently seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he said, "I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W), so I wanted to try Naodra."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the turf of the Tire area, and it is sometimes sprinkled 1W.
In the case where Big Carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but it is effective to use straight Dora in a narrow hall on both sides.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd with Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of the tie-up).
Although the ball does not catch, it is accompanied by a risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent on the left).
It's a professional technique that I can't help but think of.

"Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?"
Greta Tounberg, a Swedish environmental activist who gave a speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech is attracting attention, there is a message that insults Greta.
[Tweet Collection] Greta Tounbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?
Political commentators said on American television that Greta was " mentally ill and used by parents and international leftists" and apologized to the TV station.
In Japan, there are many reports on the Internet that comment on the part that Mr. Greta is not talking about.
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'm going to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories.
Mr. Greta said, "Look, again, as you realize, those who hate me are as active as ever; they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, and they come to think of as long as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that the majority did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be questioning the topic.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I wonder if they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to awaken.
It is changing.
Even if people like that change, they don't like it.
See you on the street on Friday!
On Friday 20th, the previous week, climate change strikes were held in New York and other parts of the world.

Wedgeshot of Garcia
I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not able to stretch well.
did you see the sixth eagle and seventh bardy win?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so I felt like I was going back.
But I regretted that I couldn't reach in the second half.
what did you get in this tournament?
Recently (shots) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that the fairway was able to keep firmly in the narrow course.
It was a course where rough and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
what's the difference?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but the gallery was filming videos.
I didn't have much else to change, but I just co-hosted a tournament where there are few Japanese players, so I came to the game with the feeling that I won't lose to overseas players.
We will continue in the second half of the game, but if we do not win more than one, we will not be able to aim for the winning king.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of " forgetfulness"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has become clear that it is possible to remain extremely mild and forget about things.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Professor Shunsuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as deaths from infections and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are also decreasing due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not possible to solve the problem by itself or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
How to keep things to an extent of forgetting.
Is there anyone who is easy to become dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to " forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be stored.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the end, poverty becomes obese, and speaking of what you do, you can only see the TV vaguely, and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can be Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to read books daily and think about things that are not metabolized.
