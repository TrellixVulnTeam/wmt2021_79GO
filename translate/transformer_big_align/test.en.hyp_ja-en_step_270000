Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Accidents and incidents involving young people pedaling - Yahoo! News
Violence against road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases over 75 years of age.
It is important for young people to call attention in the same way.
do you take a fashionable look at your feet?
are you safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly, which is often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that in the young age, people are distracted by other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, some women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, pumps, sandals and mulles, and drive them as they are.
While some people know that it is not suitable for driving, some people say it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people do not think at all that it is possible to lead to danger, and many people are driving casually.
However, driving in high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and Article 70 "Prohibition of safety driving obligations" which stipulates that "No driving should be performed to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, "Don't drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a way that prevents or prevents driving operations, such as wearing shoes, slippers, high heels, etc.
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if not specified as high heels.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, first fix the foot to the floor, place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right as a starting point when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the lid firmly fixed so that it does not wear regardless of car behavior.
However, in high heels, the area where the kakato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal becomes smaller and the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is difficult to adjust.
This may lead to danger.
Most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull high heels, and sometimes the heels are pulled and the pedals cannot be trampled when emergency braking, or the heels are pulled off by the beats and the heels are pulled, and the heels can not be stepped on.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is no longer returned.

Local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics, manufactured by Awaji Kawara, filed for quasi-self bankruptcy debt of approximately 2 billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo!
This was partly due to the sluggish housing market and the frequent damage caused by the earthquake, which led to the rise of consumers' roofs.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Corporate Code: 5:30173983, Capital: 99.2 million yen, Otani 881-8, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self bankruptcy at the Kobe District Court on August 30.

The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as Ibushi tile maker, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara County (present-day Minamiawaji City).
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged with Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. to succeed the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., and at the same time, the head office was moved to its present location after changing its current name.
After that, sales offices were established in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was based on Ibusshi-gawara, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western-style tiles such as Hiraita-gawara were manufactured at 70% and Ibusshi-gawara were manufactured at 30%.

In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in profit margin due to the surge in fuel prices, the deficit was severe due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment.
For this reason, although financial institutions were trying to rebuild their business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of their debts, there was no signs of recovery in business conditions, and the financial position gradually became tight.
I couldn't help but quit the business and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is estimated to be about 2 billion yen.

Dalbisch's current season is summarized as follows: "You can make a difference in your life until now." - Yahoo!
[From St. Louis, Missouri, 28th Japan time]
The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished, and the Cubs' Darbisch pitcher 33, who finished the pitch this season, told the interview that the current state of mind is "nothing for two days, but it's hard to see baseball from the bench without any purpose."
This season, he started 31 games with 6 wins, 8 losses, and 3/98 defenses, but he threw 2/3 178 times and robbed 229.
Especially in the second half of the game, the pitch form was stable, and he continued to play against the opponent with outstanding braking force and overwhelming power.
"Now it's definitely a big difference in my life until now, at 33 years old, I didn't think it would be like that.In spring, I thought, "I'm going to end this way too," but I feel that I can't believe myself that I came back from there and went to a better place."
I was able to gradually respond from around early June.
"The more things we can do every day, the more things we can do every day."
It was a trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses one after another, it became much more state-of-the-art.
He was also confident that he was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt out to destroy the contract after the end of this season, says, "We have to think about it now, let's talk with agents and families," but "Basically, there is no dissatisfaction with this team and it's fun."
It is not the final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work? - Yahoo!
Is there anything in common between mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.In August 2019, "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha), which focuses on beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Baizu, who is known as the leading figure in "The Fear Manga."
When you look at it in your hand, you will notice the correlation between beauty and fear in your works.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "we will stand out only when the beauty of the women lies in the opposite of fear, ugly, and shocking scenes and developments of the story."
There are many things that appear in Baizu Kazuo's works that have the keyword "snake," but there are a variety of people who receive it, such as those who see it as "a creepy creature" or those who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others are not good at it.
In this way, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake in the back.
This creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is auspicious.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
In most cases, a woman with a shadow is a beautiful woman.
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ... I feel like it is in common with beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
In particular, Orochi, the main character of Orochi, which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work.

There was no place for people to meet.
So he said, "We needed an exchange center in the area where people interacted with each other.
It is a multi-generational exchange place where elderly people participate, even if it is said to be a children's cafeteria.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps to raise children and improve the health of elderly people.
We cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that we don't create children from there.
There are various places where meals are served every day from one month to another.
The venue is diverse from several to several hundred people, from private homes to temples.

Eight new models of "Air Force 1" appeared (WWD JAPAN.com)
Nike will launch eight new models of Air Force 1 (AIR FORCE 1) which have gained popularity as a brand-leading sneaker since its launch in October 1982.
As Nike Women's Footwear Senior Creative Director Georgena James says, "Women are diverse and seek something different from others," the update is based on the experience of the collection "The One Reimagined" (launched in 2018) that re-designed sneakers from a female perspective.
[Image] Eight new models of "Air Force 1" such as NBA collaboration and Goretex models appeared one after another.
The "Air Force 1 NBA Pack" in collaboration with the NBA appeared in two types: low-cut and high-cut.
The low cut is based on the NBA's red, yellow, black and navy colors, and the high cut is used in three teams' uniform colors, including the Los Angeles Lakers.
The NBA logo is attached to the heel and shoetans, and satin fabric is used in the back of the upper for the first time.
The price is $132 million in tax and will be released on October 1.
The "Air Force 1 Swish Pack" is designed with the word "Swish" as it is.
It is noteworthy that the part of the shoe tongue, which should have originally been decorated with the brand logo, has been changed to the special "SWOOSH" character.
The "Air Force 1 Shadow" is characterized by the duality of each distille, including the side swush, inspired by shadows.
The outsole is thicker and taller than the original, while the hollowing out of the center makes the woman happy and lightweight.
The price is $132 million in tax and will be released on October 3.
"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from crashed US forces.
It can be manufactured at low cost, and its range is about 1000 km.
It's also a strength that it's hard to catch radar because it's flying low."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Soon after, Yemen's anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo crude oil against Iran, we aim to let the international community know that there is a corresponding pain."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over.After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fusi factions, but the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever, and there is enough possibility that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a full-time employee?
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
September 27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, some companies have started a rare mechanism called "YouTuber Adoption," which is adopted as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX and representative of the subsidiary and staff first that YouTuber was actually adopted.
I want to support young people who are working hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
The number of young people who want to work in the future will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams of bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, hiring young people who are chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber and trying to support them is hiring YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTubers are not able to earn as much revenue as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to selected creators.
At first, we will support the demerit of the occupation of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea Wants to Go back to GSOMIA" Deputy U.S. Assistant Secretary of State - Yahoo!
U.S. Deputy U.S. Undersecretary of State for South Korea and Japan, Mr. Napper, in an interview with the U.S. Ambassador's official residence in Tokyo, said on November 27, "We hope that South Korea will reconsider and return the decision to destroy it."
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information with Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper argues that without GSOMIA, the crisis cannot be effectively addressed.
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of mediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

The image certainly has a character from October 4 (fra den 4. oktober).
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try most on macOS Catalina.
This is a feature that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and it was previously realized with third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected that it is better at perfection (or response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but I want to experience this next generation of macOS fully.

[The first half of the Bud Olympic race] world champion Momota Kento and strong Sutennari lead one step!
Men's singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championship (Switzerland Basel) in badminton's big event in August, finished the training camp in early September and entered the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from 17th.
Here, we look back at the first half of the race between May and August, when the Tokyo Olympic Games were held next year, and we look forward to the men's singles for the mid-season (September to December) (Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).
Beginning in May, badminton's Olympic race took place at the end of the World Championships, where top athletes competed in the Super 500 or higher.
The two winners of the first half of the competition were Kento Momota, who won two of the four contests, and Shutensei (Cho Tienchen).
Momota won the World Championship and Shutensei won the championship with the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls Japan OP (S750).
The tournament has been held since May in the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July) and World Championships (August).
Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was only one of the World Championships, fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the mid-term competition from September onwards.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
See also young Thai people!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from repeated battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Shutensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the playing field increased so that he could continue his good performance.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the first half of the game was played by Thai young Ace Cantafone and Indian Cy Praniz B.
And he is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is fighting alone in Europe.
Although Cantaffon did not advance to the finals at the top level, he was able to advance to the top level by entering the fourth best in this season.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a huge potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Praniz B. also took a step out of India, where he had good players in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, are also catching up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released as a result of the revision of the Telecommunications Business Law in October.
However, it almost stopped.
In the summer of last year, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry was postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile phone companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, the communication fee was set to increase.
Softbank and KDDI (au) announced plans to make the device up to half the price.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies continue to "enclose" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination of SIM locks.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was because the development of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
It was expected to be a detonator of lower price competition, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility for the business.
This revision of the price was triggered by the comments of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's good to stay at all."
However, the government-made price reduction does not seem to distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they are told by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price," there are cases where consumer burden exceeds half price.
Companies must make careful and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings by themselves.
Reduced withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on March 26, that they had decided to reduce the amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage from special fraud.
For depositors over 70 years old and older who have not traded at ATMs for a certain amount or more over the past three years, the maximum amount that can be redeemed by cash card is 500,000 yen.
The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be closed on October 1, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank will be lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are spoofed by financial institutions and police officials, and ATMs are sent out.
The sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on March 27, that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room, including Tsururyu YOKOTSUNAGI, to the Mutsu room of one Tokoyama, following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (Gensekiwaki inverted hoko).
Mutsu-style room is the same as Izutsu-shitsu.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (formerly Kirishima Ozeki) was a younger brother of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was born in Izutsu-shitsu.
On the 16th, Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily kept in the mirror room of the same gate, and future treatment was discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers, including Juryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[ Rugby World Cup] One-shot Delegation & Fighting Overseas ripples for U.S. players' "face risk tackle" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quill is a rough play, former England national "not a tack."
The Japan Rugby World Cup was held on 26 July, and the United States, the last of its 20 participating countries, lost 7-45 in England.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FL John Quill later called the ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
Foreign media also released the actual scene with video, and former English players complained that "an insult and poor play" was "not a tack."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The real moment of "face risk tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill.
The fight was over.
It is the second half 29 minutes that I received at 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy, the English general Farrell was somewhat balanced when he caught his ally's path.
It was Quill who went to tackle this.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the opponent's head and head are in contact with each other, and the shape is like a head.
Farrell was devastated and collapsed.
A fierce protest was made by English players against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and the air was instantly touched.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Quill leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked him to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" features the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and was dropped."
In the article, he introduced the comments of the commentator Hugo Mona on former England players.
"It's an insult, it's not a tack, it's a poor play."
The United States, with only one player remaining in the game, managed to escape the final loss in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left the poor aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), for the first time, announced the name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nikka (Japan Red Cross).
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were included: the National Hospital Organization of Wara Hospital in straw city, the Three Kingdoms Hospital in brooke city, the Oda Hospital in brooke town, and the Wakasa Takahama Hospital in wukohama town.
four hospitals that are restructured
In order to prevent the expansion of medical expenses due to aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, we would like to request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion force, it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to fears that close hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53, 7%), Hokkaido (48, 6%), Miyagi (47, 5%), Yamaguchi (46, 7%), Okayama (43, %).
The number of participants was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that could respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need for publicizing the hospital's name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with 12.46 thousand beds (18 years) nationwide to 1191,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds for "advanced acute and acute periods" and "advanced periods" in which nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while rehabilitation for elderly people is lacking.
To cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical professionals discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain a cautious stance and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention such as the assumption of eruption of Mt.Komagatake, road etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forests, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Watari Island tube.
About 400 people from 20 organizations, including roads and 3 towns, participated.

It was the first large-scale training in 18 years for residents to participate.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt. Komaga erupted and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were established in both Mori and Nanae towns, and residents moved by bus and police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 districts recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of domestic livestock infectious disease "Ton cholera."
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, where pigs and wild boars have been identified.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs that have been vaccinated is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods outside the region is recognized.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, the procedure will be completed in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
With regard to areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, according to experts, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination, receives the Ministry's confirmation, and permits use by the Governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region is extremely determined again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, ovulation, etc. are limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
He advocates the safety of the inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The draft amendment of the guidelines was compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Protection Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7, and new anti-defection guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Keisuke Honda, an open approach to Manu!
"You don't need money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and his former Japan representative, Mr. Keisuke Honda, made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play in the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan time, said, "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda.
At present, United has suffered several injuries, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Ole Gunner Suhlshal, was forced to slip in the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faced challenges in the quality of the front lines.
As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
Nine goals scored in 18 Melbourne Victory games are "hard records," but it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to take full attention away from his entertainment managing Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward because of the veterans who declared their goal to compete in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and shops | Shizuoka Shimbun
PokeTalk is a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed a total of 500 units to stores in Hamamatsu City for the project to lease a portable translation machine called "PokeTalk" to its member office for free.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy this translator in a centralized manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound travelers.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
It covers 60% of the city.
The map app "Google Map" also started showing where to rent it, so that you can see the location of "stores for foreign languages" on your smartphone.
It is accessible from the Lake Hamana Tourist Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk to 74 languages was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city under the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We hope that the business environment is severe and will lead to the development of new foreign customers."
right now, do you need to tie up the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shot is not necessarily a tip-up shot.
For example, if you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of par 5, you can hit the ball on the ground and use the so-called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a high head volume, which entails the risk of the ball being scattered, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year of professional career, he was 166 cm in height and is currently seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he said, "I didn't have a spoon (3W) shot, so I wanted to try straight Dora."
The ball can be dropped from the practice round to the top of the lawn of the ti area, and the ball can also be sprinkled with 1W.
In cases where big carrie is required, a lot of tiup is used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"You can use it in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd with Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration that leak from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a direct drag to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the time of ticking).
Although the ball does not catch, it is accompanied by a risk of slices, "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that I can't help but think of.

The original manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa was released for the first time.
The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, which was first published in Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall.
Writer Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA (1892-1927) published his essay "Shoku Bunshimura Memorial Hall in Kita Ward, Tokyo" by Junichiro TANIZAKI in his last years of fighting literature.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.

[Tweet Collection] Greta Tounbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?
Political commentators said Greta was "psychologically sick and used by parents and international leftists" on American television, and the TV station apologized.
In Japan, there are many messages on the Internet that comment on the part that Mr. Greta is not talking about, such as "It is used and cute" and "It is better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'll think of as much lies and conspiracy theories as i can.
Greta said, "Look, it started again, and as you realize, those who dislike me are still active, and I follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, and they come to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
He pointed out that the adults did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be distracting from the topic.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
It has changed.
Even if people like that change, they don't like it.
Friday, meet on the street!
On Friday 20th, the previous week, climate change strikes were held in New York and other parts of the world.

Wedgeshot of Garcia
I was able to reach the level of the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not able to stretch well.
did you see eagle sixth, bardy seventh?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of returning, the chip-in eagle on No. 6 came.
But I regretted that I couldn't reach in the second half.
what did you get?
Recently (shots) were not so good, so I was glad that the fairway was able to keep firmly in the narrow course.
It was a course where rough and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but the gallery was filming videos.
There wasn't much else that changed, but since there were only a few Japanese players co-hosting the tournament, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
It will continue in the second half of the game, but if you don't win more than one, you can't aim for the winning king, so I want to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of forgetting?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits has been elucidated, and it has become clear that it is possible to remain extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital We talked to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of the Stroke Center.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is believed that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people can live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are decreasing due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer agents.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
We need to create an environment that can live with peace of mind in the community as a whole.
How to keep things forgotten
Is there anyone who is easy to become dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that the symptoms can be kept as low as possible to " forget things."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases and tends to be more prone to people.
First, people in Metabo tend to become dementia.
Dementia is one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where cooking is not possible can be used in the first place.
Then it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, poverty, but obesity, and speaking of what we do, we can only vaguely see TV, and we can become physically disabled.
Similar situations can also be in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think and do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books daily and think about things that are not metabolized.
