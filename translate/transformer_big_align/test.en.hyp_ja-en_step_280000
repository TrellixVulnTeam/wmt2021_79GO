Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving young people pedaling wrong - Yahoo! News
Violations against road traffic laws
However, it is a big mistake to think that it is only an elderly driver.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, more than 1080 cases were aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases aged 75 or older.
It is important for young people to call attention in the same way.
are you going to take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, young people may be confused by other things such as music and conversation, or trampled due to clothes.
In particular, some women choose various shoes according to their high heels, pamps, sandals, and mulles, and then drive them.
While some people know that it is not suitable for driving, it is troublesome to change clothes, but some people don't think about the possibility that it can lead to danger at all, and many people are driving without fear.
However, driving on high heels and sandals is in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and Article 70 "Prohibition of safety driving obligation" which stipulates that the operation should not be performed to cause accidents and harm people.
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee.For example, in Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, there is a statement that the driver shall not drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) in a manner that prevents the operation of the vehicle by wearing shoes, slippers, high heels or other footwear that may interfere with the operation.
The aim of each prefecture is to consider driving in " footwear that may interfere with driving operation" even if not specified as high heels.
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious, given the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, the foot is fixed to the floor, the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the foot is tilted to the right.
At this time, it is important to keep it firmly in place so that it does not break regardless of car behavior.
However, in high heels, the area where the kakato is grounded on the floor is small, and the area where the foot is grounded on the pedal is smaller and the area where the foot is grounded on the pedal is difficult to adjust.
This can lead to danger.
Most cars also have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull high heels, so when it comes to emergency braking, the heel is pulled and the pedal cannot be trampled, or when the heel is pulled, the heel is removed and the heel is inserted into the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is a case where the heel pulls back to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

The application agent was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), Daichi Yoshida Law Firm, and Telephone 06-6365-6038.
The company was founded in June 1895 and reorganized in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of Ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishinami-cho, Mihara County (present Minamiawaji City).
In October 1986, Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. merged with Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd.

In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in the profit margin caused by the surge in fuel prices, the deficit continued to be severe due to excessive interest-bearing liabilities associated with inventory and business fixed investment.
For this reason, financial institutions tried to rebuild their business by asking them to ease the conditions for repayment of their borrowings, but there was no signs of recovery in business conditions, and the financial situation gradually began to tighten.
I couldn't help but quit the business and took this action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is expected to be around 2 billion yen.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work? - Yahoo!
What is the mystical beauty and the expression of shadows in common?
Since the 1950s, a number of works have been sent to the world.The "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I look at it in my hand, I realize again that the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Baizu's work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
5 beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "if fear, ugliness, and the shocking scenes and developments of the story are opposite to each other, they stand out."
There are many things that appear in Baizu Kazuo's works that are called "swords," but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as those seen as "a creepy creature" or those who feel "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be a snake.
This creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is auspicious.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "Later Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
It is the market for beautiful women with shadows to become "Hebi-nyo."
Is it possible to say that it is a "cool beauty" type if you put it in an imaginative way? ... I feel that it seems that there is something in common between the beautiful girls who appear in Baizu works.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work.However, in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, she sleeps deep every 100 years, and some parts with mysterious power are reminiscent of snakes somewhere.

Mr. Tomohiro Yamamoto, Deputy Minister of Defense, deleted comments on Twitter that he wrote "It's delicious" when he ate at Yakitoriya in Saga Prefecture by 27.
Mr. Yamamoto entered the prefecture on February 26 to explain the results of the accident that the AH64D combat helicopter of the Ground Self-Defense Force crashed last February in Kanzaki City, Yamagata Prefecture.
On the night of the same day, "I visited Saga Prefecture on a business trip!!"

The number increased by one to six times compared to 2018, and there are 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, which increased by nine compared to last year.
why is it now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, the president and social activist of NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So they said, "We needed an exchange center in a region where people interacted with each other.
It is a place for multi-generational exchanges that elderly people also participate in, even if it is a gyoko shokudou.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also helps to raise children and improve the health of elderly people.
We cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that we don't create children from there.
There are a variety of places to offer meals every day from one month to another.
The venue is diverse from several to several hundred people, from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere is getting ready for people who want to do it.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
we've heard about issues like safe management.
Yuasa said, "By engaging with many people, values change." "Connecting with society will become a safety net in the event of disasters."
It seems like the light of hope in closed society.

Nike will launch eight new models of Air Force 1 (AIR FORCE 1), which has been popular as a sneaker representing the brand since its launch in October 1982.
Three of the eight models are for women, and as Nike Women's Footwear Senior Creative Director Georgena James says, "Women are diverse and seek something different from others," updates have been added based on the experience of "The One Reimagining," a collection that redesigns sneakers from a female perspective.
[Image] Eight new models of "Air Force 1" including NBA collaboration and Goretex models appeared one after another.
"Air Force 1 NBA Pack" in collaboration with the NBA appeared in two types: low-cut and high-cut.
The low cut is based on the NBA's red, yellow, black and navy colors, and the high cut is available in three teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing drones from crashed US forces.
It can be manufactured at low cost, and its range is about 1000 km.
To fly low-flying, it is also a strength that makes it difficult to catch radars."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Lamco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of the crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo crude oil against Iran, we aim to inform the international community that it will suffer accordingly."
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over.After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure them forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" are facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why the super personality YouTuber became a regular employee.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
September 27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, some companies have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is adopted as regular employees.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who are working hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the career rankings where elementary school students want to get in the future, and there will be more and more young people aiming for them in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams of bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "YouTuber Adoption" to recruit and support young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTubers are not able to earn as much revenue as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time jobs, and many creators who can't recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this initiative, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation to creators who have adopted it.
At first, we will support the demerit of the occupation of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary - Yahoo! News
Deputy U.S. Undersecretary of State for Korea and Japan, Mr. Napper said on November 27 that he would like Korea to reconsider and return its decision to abandon the Japan-Korea Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on November 23 at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to mention the reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing missile launch information with Japan, the United States, and the United States.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper claimed, "We can't effectively respond to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
China and Russia also expressed the threat that the joint flight training conducted in July over the Sea of Japan was the first in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating the national interest of the United States."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea will play a positive role to fill the gap."

The report covers about 90% of the international assessment measures (INES) that show seriousness (not important for safety) and those that are not evaluated.However, based on the lessons learned from the accident and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. in 11 years, there is a need for an unwavering awareness of safety.
Mitsukazu Soda, who completes the story and original drawings of creative picture books and solicits donations for publication, said on September 18 in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture.
Koichi Soda (64), an artist in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, started a crowdfunding campaign aimed at publishing creative picture books inspired by local legends.
Mr. Soda, who was born in Hokkaido and started working as a cooperative unit in April this year, said, "I want to convey the compassion of Fukui people through picture books based on deep faith."
[Donations are here] To convey Fukui's heart.
Mr. Soda has been active as an artist working on contemporary art with mathematical motifs, and he has also worked as a partner since he passed the rekiryaku.
After working on community development in Nagano, Kumamoto, and Tochigi, he joined Echizen City in April this year.
It is located in the city where Kako Riko and Iwasaki Chihiro produced, and aims to develop a town using picture books.
Mr. Soda lived in the city and said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion that I could understand for the first time."
What attracted attention was the legend of Awara City, "The Face of the Wife Odoshi Oni."
It is a story that she continues to recite Nenbutsu (Buddhist prayer) to help her mother, without worrying about the fact that her gentle wife was surprised by her face.
"I forgot my hatred and returned it with compassion and kindness, and I felt the origin of the faith and kindness of the people in Fukui."
Inspired by Soda's original picture book, he went to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived and interviewed him.
In June, he took advantage of his position to draw 10 scenes with warm watercolors, and the material of the picture book was melted.
In addition, Echizen Washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City, will be used to cover picture books with Japanese paper.
It connects parents and children with the opportunity to enjoy the touch of Japanese paper by reading and listening.
For 600 copies, the goal of the donation is 850,000 yen.
The deadline is October 25.
Mr. Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud nationwide.
I want to convey the true kindness and compassion that children have inherited through picture books."
It is one of the projects that Fukui Prefecture has certified 11 projects for regional revitalization that are challenged by the cooperative forces and businesses in the prefecture, and uses the hometown tax to support them.
The Fukui Shimbun provides information and the Fukui Bank cooperates with management support.

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] world champion Kento Momota and strong Zhou Tensei lead one step!
"Women's Singles."
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland Basel), a big event in badminton held in August, completed a training camp in early September and participated in the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) which will open from 17th.
Here, we look back at the first half of the race between May and August, when the Tokyo Olympic Games were held next year, and look forward to the men's singles in the mid-season (September to December).
At the end of the World Championships in May, badminton's Olympic race took over the top four tournaments (Super 500 or higher).
In the first half of the competition, two of the best players were Mr. Kento Momota, who won two of the four competitions, and Mr. Zhou Tiancheng, Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championships and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic Games.
Momota also controls JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July) and World Championships (August).
Although the number of players is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was only one of the World Championships, fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
It is expected that the best results will be achieved in the middle of a series of high-level competitions since September.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
Young Thai people also pay attention!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He was originally a strong physical player and did not suffer a series of battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Until last year, Zhou Tiancheng had an impression that there was no explosive force, but this year the stability of the playing field increased so that he could continue his good grades.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, the results of the first half of the game were Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Planis B.
And he is the 3rd player of Anders Antonsen, who is struggling alone as a European.
Although Cantaffon did not advance to the finals at the top level, he was able to advance to the top level by entering the top 4 in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranith B. also took a step out of India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been late due to injury, are also catching up in the future, so attention should be paid to the Indian forces after the mid-war period.
New charges for mobile phones Price reductions in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released following the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Law in October.
However, it was largely stopped.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer that "there is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
The major factor is that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, the communication fee was set to increase.
Softbank and KDDI (au) announced plans to increase the number of terminals by half.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies seem to continue "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) announced that it would require immediate cancellation.
The company also needs to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten did not proceed as planned with the development of communication networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be a detonator of lower price competition, so it was dressed as a shoulder strap.
It may have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The timing and fees of the full-scale service are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, we would like to take responsibility for our business.
This revision of the price was triggered by the comments of Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I don't think it's good to stay at all."
However, I don't think that the reduction in government prices will distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they can be heard from the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price," there are cases where consumer burden exceeds half price.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, companies must carefully and easily explain.
Reduced withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) in Mie Prefecture announced on September 26 that they had decided to reduce the amount of withdrawal by cash card to prevent damage from special fraud.
For depositors over 70 years old and older who have not traded at ATMs for a certain amount or more over the past three years, the maximum amount of cash card that can be withdrawn on a day is 500,000 yen.
The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be reduced from October 1, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank will be reduced from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by ATMs, including financial institutions and police officials.
After the sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room, including Tsururyu YOKOTSUTSUNAGI, to the Mutsu room of one of the Tokoyama, following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki inverted hoko).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Itsutsu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Ozeki Kirishima) was a brother of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was from the Izutsu room.
On the 16th, Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily detained in the same Kagamiyama room, and future treatment was discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers including Juryo Kirimayama from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[Rogue W Cup] One-shot Departure & Struggles Overseas ripples to "face risk tackle" of U.S. players - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quill is a rough play, former England representative "not a tack."
The Japan Rugby World Cup was the last game to be played in 20 countries, and the United States lost 7-45 in England.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FL John Quill later called a ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
Foreign media also released the actual scene with video, and former English players complained that "an insult and a cowardly play" "It is not a tack."
[Video] "A insult and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The moment of "face risk tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill is the real moment.
A hot fight broke out.
It is the second half 29 minutes that I greeted at 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy's battle, the English captain Farrell was somewhat balanced when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tackle.
However, he raised the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other, and they are in a shape that looks like a head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
A fierce protest was made by English players to push Quill to play clearly lacking legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an air of touch.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked for a fair play.
The local media "staff" in New Zealand, a strong rugby player, is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players drop out in poor play, England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, and was dropped."
In the article, he introduced the comments of former England player and commentator Hugo Mona.
"It's an insult, it's a coward, it's not a tackle, it's a poor play."
The United States, which had lost only one game, managed to escape the loss by trying to win the game in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste behind.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), for the first time, announced the name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals such as Nika.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four of them were targeted at the National Hospital Organization of straw hospital in straw city.
⇒ 4 hospitals to be reorganized "the standards are strange."
In order to reduce medical costs, which are expanding due to the aging population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, we would like to request a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital, and we will conclude by September next year.
There is no force, but it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that a nearby hospital will disappear.
It was announced at the same meeting.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the percentage was high in Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43, 3 percent).
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medicine, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car.
The target hospitals are considered to be abolished and some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all baby boomers were over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of hospital beds to 19.11,000 in 18 years.
Currently, there are many beds for "altitude acute" and "acute" periods where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are required, while rehabilitation services that are highly needed for elderly people are lacking.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
For the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical professionals discuss it, many local residents and chiefs maintain a cautious stance and the debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with few achievements.
Comprehensive training on disaster prevention such as the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komagatake, road etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Watari Island tube.
About 400 people from 20 organizations including roads and 3 towns participated.
The first event since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It was the first time in 18 years that local residents participated in the wide-area training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt.Komake erupted and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were established in forests and Nanae Ryocho, and residents moved by buses and police vehicles prepared by each town.

9 regions recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Tonn cholera," an infectious disease of livestock, which is not currently recognized.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs that have been vaccinated is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods outside the region is permitted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has temporarily suspended its status as a clean country.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "Voculation Recommended Area" based on the opinions of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program" that summarizes the range, time, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination, receives the approval of the province, and allows it to be used by the governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed as recommended areas for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region is extremely determined again.
The transfer of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulatory substances is limited in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, it is not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He also advocates the safety of the inoculated pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors.
The draft revision of the guidelines was compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasure Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new quarantine guidelines will be implemented.
Unaffiliated Keisuke Honda, a public approach to Manu!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan time, said, "Please give us an offer, we don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was featured in the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda.
At present, there are several injuries in United, including MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcial, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Ole Gunner Suhlshal, was forced to slip through the league with 22 wins and 22 losses, and faced challenges in front quality.
As a result, Honda was named by the Australian media as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, Honda's contract as a creative side player, not a striker, can fill holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
9 points scored in 18 matches at Melbourne Victory are "solid records," but it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to get full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also noteworthy that United will move forward because of the veterans who declared their goal to compete in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and shops | Shizuoka Shimbun at Es
PokeTalk, a portable translation machine that provides free loan to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
On June 26, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member office, including stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy this translator in a centralized manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations, and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" also started showing where to rent it, so that you can see the location of "stores for foreign languages" on your smartphone.
It is accessible from the Hamana Lake Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was initiated in April by nine organizations in the city under the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "We hope that the business environment is severe and will lead to the development of new foreign customers."
right now, do you need to tie up the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not necessarily tipping.
There is also the so-called "naodra" technique to hold a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance with the second hit of par 5.
Recently, 1W has a high head volume, which involves the risk of the ball being scattered, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanyo is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year of professional career, he was 166 cm in height and is currently seventh in the driving stance division (average 304.02 yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
At the beginning of spring, "I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W), so I thought I wanted to try Naodora."
The ball can be dropped from the practice round to the top of the grass in the ti area, and the ball can also be sprinkled with 1W.
In cases where big carrie is required, a lot of tie-ups are used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"It can be used in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd with Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration that leak from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"You can't fly straight, even if you hit the upper, even if you hit it with a down blow, you go right with a cut track.I was originally doing a direct drag to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the time of ticking).
The ball does not catch, and it is accompanied by a risk of slices, but "So the left side can be erased (not bent to the left).
It's a professional technique that makes you feel involuntarily.

The original manuscript before the suicide of Akutagawa was published for the first time.
The manuscript written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published at the Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Museum.
Writer Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA (1892-1927) published his essay "Shoku Bunshimura Memorial Hall in Kita Ward, Tokyo" in his last years of fighting literary theory with Junichiro TANIZAKI.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.
Although it was known that the manuscript was included in the whole collection, it was the first time that the manuscript was published publicly.
It is said that he wrote a few months before Akutagawa committed suicide, and the museum researcher, Mr. Sadai, said, "I can see that Akutagawa, who was both mentally and physically weakened, faces serious issues of literature with great determination."
A total of 12 essays were published in the April 27 issue of "Ryushu Shunju."

[Tweet Collection] Greta Tounbeli: Why are the adults laughing and threatening their children?
Political commentators said Greta was " mentally ill and used by parents and international leftists" on American television and apologized to the TV station.
In Japan, there are many messages on the Internet that comment on the part that Greta doesn't speak about, such as "It's used and cute" and "It's better to go to school."
On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'm going to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories.
Greta said, "Look, it started again, as you realize, those who hate me are as active as ever, chasing my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others, they come to think of as far as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
He pointed out that the adults did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be distracting from the topic.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
It is changing.
People like that change, but they don't like it.
Friday, see you on the street!
On Friday 20th, the previous week, climate change strikes were held in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta also called on to do it on Friday 27th.

I was able to reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not able to stretch well.
did you see the sixth eagle, seventh bardy?
Even after I hit Boggy on No. 4, there was still a par 5 left, so if I tried to get back, the chip-in eagle on No. 6 came.
No. 7 was a chance, but I regretted that I couldn't reach it later.
what did you get?
Recently (shots) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that the fairway was able to keep firmly in the narrow course.
It was a course where roughs and reverses were broken and the distance between them was changed.
What is the difference between ordinary competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos for the gallery.
Other than that, there was not much change, but just because there are few Japanese players in co-hosting competitions, I came to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players."
The second half of the game will continue, but if you do not win more than one, you should not aim for the winning king, so I want to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of forgetting?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Professor Shunsuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in the degree from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug Dnepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no expectation of a significant cure effect.
On the other hand, the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have decreased due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
We need to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind.
How to keep things to an extent of forgetting.
Is there anyone who is easy to become dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to " forget things."
Dementia is considered to be one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people with metabol tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be stored.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, poverty, but obesity, and speaking of what we do, we can only vaguely see the TV, and we are physically disabled.
A similar situation can also be in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books daily and think about things that are not metabolized.
