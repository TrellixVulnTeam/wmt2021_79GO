Driving at high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving young people accidentally pedaling - Yahoo! News
Violence against road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, there were more than 1080 cases aged 24 or younger, exceeding 1032 cases aged 75 or older.
It is important for young people to call attention in the same way.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly, which is often thought to be due to the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that in the young age, there is a misconception that music and conversation are distracted by other things, and a mistake caused by clothes.
In particular, some women choose high heels, pumps, sandals, and mulles and choose various shoes according to their outfits that day.
Some people say that it is troublesome to change clothes while knowing that it is not suitable for driving, but some people do not think at all that there is a possibility that it will lead to danger, and many people are driving casually.
However, driving on high heels and sandals is in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations, and Article 70 "Prohibition of safety driving obligations" which stipulates that "no driving should be done to cause accidents and harm people."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, "Don't drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) by wearing shoes in a manner that prevents or hinders driving operations, such as wearing shoes, slippers, heels and other footwear.
In each prefecture, even if it is not specified as high heels, it is similar to the purpose of considering driving in " footwear that may hinder operation."
So why is driving at high heels dangerous?
It is obvious, given the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and secure pedal operation, the foot is fixed on the floor, the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, the foot is tilted to the right.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep it firmly fixed so that it does not break.
However, because the height of the heel has an angle on the entire foot, the area of the foot that is grounded on the pedal is also smaller, making it difficult to adjust finely.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull high heels, and sometimes the heels are pulled by the heels and pedals cannot be trampled, or the heels are removed by the beats that are pulled by the heels, and the heels are sandwiched between the back of the pedals.
In addition, there are cases where the heel is pulled to the back of the pedal when the pedal is pushed back and the accelerator pedal is not returned.

Local Industry in Hyogo-Awaji Island, Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of "Awaji tiles," filed for quasi-self bankruptcies.
It was also affected by the sluggish housing market and the progress of "consumer roofing away" due to repeated earthquake damage.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Code:53173983, Capital: 99.2 million yen, Otani 881-8, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for quasi-self bankruptcy at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
One application agent was Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishitenman, Kita Ward, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), Daichi Yoshida Law Firm and Telephone 06-6365-6038.
The company was founded in June 1895 and incorporated in April 1961.
At first, he started his business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry in Awaji Island, in Nishitan-cho, Mihara-gun (present-day Minamiawaji City).
In October 1986, the company merged with Kyowa Kiln Co., Ltd. and succeeded the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., while at the same time changing its current business name and moving its head office to its present location.
After that, the company established sales bases in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, and Miyazaki City, and it became the current system.
The company built a wide operating base centered in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies, and recorded annual sales of approximately 3116 million yen in the fiscal year ended December 2004.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, due to the sluggish housing market since the Lehman shock and the frequent damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, consumer demand was sluggish, and the annual sales of the fiscal year ended December 2018 were down to approximately 1345 million yen.
In terms of profits, in addition to the decline in the profit margin associated with the surge in fuel prices, the deficit continued to be severe due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory and business fixed investment.
For this reason, although financial institutions were trying to rebuild their business by requesting financial institutions to ease the conditions for repayment of their debts, there was no signs of recovery in business conditions, and the financial position gradually became tight.
I couldn't help but quit the business and took this action.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be around 2 billion yen.

Dalbisch summarised this season, "It's good to make a difference in my life" (East SpoWeb) - Yahoo!
[From St. Louis, Missouri (28th Japan time) ]
The possibility of playing in the playoffs was extinguished, and the Cubs' Dalbisch pitcher 33, who finished the pitch this season, responded to the interview, saying "I have not done anything for two days, but I can't afford to see baseball from the bench without any purpose."
He started 31 games this season with 6 wins, 8 losses, and 3/98 defenses.
Especially in the second half of the game, the pitch form was stable, and the opponent's batter continued to play with the opponent with excellent braking force and overwhelming power.
"I was 33 years old now, and I didn't think it would be that kind of feeling.In spring, I thought, "I wonder if I will end this way too," but I feel that I can't believe that I came back from there and went to a better place."
From around early June, I gradually learned how to respond.
"The more things we can do every day, the more we can do one day."
There was trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses one after another, it became much more and more successful.
It also led to confidence that he was thrown without entering the injured list throughout the year.
Dalbisch, who has the right to opt out after the end of this season, says, "I'm going to have to think about it, I'm going to talk to my agents and my family."
It is not the final conclusion, but the feeling is firm.

beauty and ugly?
What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu Kazuo's work? - Yahoo! News
Is there anything in common between mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.The "Baizu Kazuo Bijo Collection" (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When I look at it in my hand, I notice the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Baizu Kazuo's work again.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
Five beautiful girls in Baizu Kazuo's work
In the preface of the "Beautiful Girl Collection," there was a statement that "the fear, the ugliness, the shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only when they have the beauty of their opposites."
There are many things that appear in Baizu Kazuo's works that have the keyword "snake," but there are various ways to receive snakes, such as being captured as "a creepy creature" by the viewer, or someone who feels "beautiful."
Some people like reptiles in the world, and others don't like them.
In this way, by the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be the "snake" of living things in the back.
This creature has been worshipped as a spiritually powerful creature since ancient times.
There are "Hebi Girl" and "The Little Girl" in the 1965 series "Mama Kowai!."
It is the market for beautiful women with shadows to become "Hebi Woman."
In other words, can I say that it is a "cool beauty" type? ... I feel like that is the commonality of the beautiful girls appearing in Baizu works.
In particular, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," serialized in the Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Baizu's work.However, in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, she sleeps deep every 100 years, and some parts with mysterious power are reminiscent of snakes.

Seven students who were studying in Saviertaka (principal of Hideki Matsubara) paid a courtesy visit to Mayor Tsuyoshi Fujita of Onoda City, Sanyo.
The students talked about what they wanted to do during their stay, and Mayor Fujita encouraged them to live a meaningful school life.

Mr. Yamamoto entered the prefecture on February 26 to explain the results of the accident that the AH64D combat helicopter of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force crashed in Kanzaki City, the prefecture.
On the night of the same day, I tweeted, "I visited Saga Prefecture on a business trip!."

[Ecsan Wakamizu] A circle of "Children's Shokudo" that provides free or inexpensive meals for children is spreading nationwide.
According to a survey by NPOs and other organizations, approximately 3,700 sites are active in Japan this year.
The number has increased by one or six times compared to 2018, and there are 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture that have increased by nine compared to last year.
why is it now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, president and social activist of Yotsu NPO, spoke about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely and the shopping district declined.
There was no place for people to meet.
So he said, "We needed a place for exchange in a region where people interacted with each other.
Even if it is a children's cafeteria, it is a "multi-generational place" where elderly people participate.
It not only eliminates eating alone, but also provides support for raising children and health for the elderly.
They cut off the chain of poverty and revitalize the region.
What's important is that we don't create children from there.
There are a variety of places where meals are served daily from one month to another.
The scale varies from several to hundreds, and the venue is diverse from private homes to temples.
The atmosphere that people who want to do is being created.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management and staff.
we're also hearing issues like a safe management system.
Even though it is gyoku, "The values change by interacting with many people." "Connecting with society becomes a safety net for disasters," says Yuasa.
It seems like the light of hope in the closed society.

"The real culprit" - Yahoo! News
"In recent years, Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in the bombing, has dramatically improved its performance by analyzing drones from crashed US forces.
It can be manufactured at low cost, and its range is approximately 1000 km.
It's also a strength that it's hard to catch radar because it flies low."
On 14 September, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi, led by President Rouhani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil.If we continue to embargo crude oil against Iran, we aim to inform the international community that it will suffer accordingly."
In the wake of the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
Some say that the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has publicly announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Middle East, we want to avoid any military intervention until at least next year's elections are over.After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not be able to endure it forever.
The U.S. and Iran's "representative war" are facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why he became a full-fledged YouTuber.
I asked the president who hired me (bizSPA!).
September 27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular with young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use their products for advertising, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is adopted as regular employees in-house.
The company's direct marketing mix (DmMiX) is the main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmMiX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first that YouTuber actually adopted.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What is YouTuber adoption in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now YouTuber is a longing for many young people.
There are also top rankings in the vocational rankings that elementary school students want to take in the future, and there will be more and more young people aiming for in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams of bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, it is "YouTuber Adoption" to recruit and support young people chasing their dreams of becoming YouTuber.
Why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people are longing for a job called YouTuber, most YouTubers have a reality that they can't earn as much as they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time, and many creators who do not allow their family to be YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide an environment for salary and content creation for creators who have adopted it.
At first, we will support the demerit of the occupation of YouTuber, which will inevitably become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" U.S. Undersecretary - Yahoo! News
U.S. Undersecretary of State for the Republic of Korea and Japan, Napper, in an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo, said on November 27, "I hope that Korea will reconsider and return the decision to destroy it."
It is unusual for senior U.S. officials to mention a reconsideration of the GSOMIA destruction.
GSOMIA is the foundation for sharing information on missile launches between Japan, Korea, the United States, and Korea.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework to protect military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Napper claimed that he could not effectively respond to the crisis without GSOMIA.
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July also showed a threat that it was the first time in history.
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill the gap."

The deadline is 25 October.
Mr. Soda said, "The heart of Fukui, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is proud of all over Japan.
I want to convey the true kindness and compassion that children have inherited through picture books."

The company employee man (19) who visited Kurashiki store (Shirarakucho, Kurashiki City) to buy a suit to wear an adult ceremony, said, "The ceremony is still ahead, but I want to buy it before the tax increase."
In this tax increase, because the tax rate for food and drink is set up in the reduction tax rate system, home centers and supermarkets will focus on daily necessities and sake.

[Read full image] Is the release date of macOS Catalina October 4th?
The image above was posted on the Danish Apple site (now modified).
The image certainly has a character from October 4 (fra den 4. oktober).
On the official website, the accuracy of the information is also high.
By the way, "Sidecar" is the feature that I personally want to try most on macOS Catalina.
This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and it is a function that was previously realized by third-party apps.
And since Sidecar is Apple's pure function, it is expected to be better at perfection (or response).
There are rumors about the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next generation of macOS.

[The first half of the Bud Olympics race] world champion Momota Kento and strong Sutennari lead one step!
Men's singles (Bad × Spi).
The Japan national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, badminton, held in August, completed a training camp in early September and participated in the China OP (Joshu/Super1000) starting from the 17th.
Here, we will look back at the first half of the race between May and August, when the Tokyo Olympic Games were held next year, and look forward to the men's singles in the middle race (September to December).
Beginning in May, badminton's Olympic race was dominated by four top players (Super 500 or higher) at the end of the World Championship.
In the first half, Kento Momota, who won two of the four contests, and Shutensei (Cho Tienchen) in Taiwan, were both successful.
Momota won the World Championships and Shutensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also has Japan OP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May at the Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/ results are 16 strong), Japan OP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since August was only one World Championships, fatigue would not be greater than the consecutive war.
There is a need for good results in mid-term matches that have been held since September.
He is a strong Taiwanese ace.
Young Thai people are also interested!
Sutennari, who also won the Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He has a strong physical strength and does not suffer from consecutive battles.
Even after the tournament, there is no major problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Until last year, Zhou Tiancheng had an impression that there was no explosive force, but this year, the stability of the playing field increased so that he could continue his good performance.
For Momota, who is ranked number one in the world ranking, he seems to be more difficult than ever.
Other than these two players, the results of the first half of the game were Thai young Ace Cantaphon and Indian Cy Praniz B.
And he is the third player of Anders Antonsen, who is fighting for the European side.
Although Cantaffon did not advance to the finals at the top level, he was able to advance to the top level by entering the top 4 in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who is now able to rally against top players seems to have a huge potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Cy Pranys B. also took a step out of India, where he had a good player in singles.
Samir Balama, Pranoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, are also catching up in the future.
New charges for mobile phones Price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for a mobile phone company was released following the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Law in October.
However, it generally stopped high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for a reduction of about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, there was no price competition.
It is a major factor that the full-scale entry into Rakuten was postponed and the oligorization of three major companies continued.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fee system that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile phone companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount on terminal charges and communications charges.
Instead of selling terminal bills, the cost of communication was set to increase.
Softbank and KDDI (au) announced plans to increase the number of terminals by half.
However, both companies can't use other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to one third of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own line.
The three companies seem to continue "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate cancellation.
Companies need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the lack of maintenance of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was expected to be a detonator of the lower price competition, so it looked like a shoulder strap.
It may have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-scale services are not disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like you to take responsibility for your business.
The price revision was triggered by the comments of the Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new charges of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to stay at all."
However, the reduction in government-made prices does not seem to distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they are told by the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that while the terminal advertises such as "maximum half price," there are cases where the consumer burden exceeds half price.
In order to avoid misunderstandings by companies themselves, it is necessary to make careful and easy-to-understand explanations.
Reduced withdrawal limit to 500,000 yen Cash card of 3 Shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Banks in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on March 26 that they decided to reduce the withdrawal limit by cash card to prevent damage to special scams.
For depositors aged 70 and over who have not made a certain amount or more withdrawal transactions at ATMs for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be paid out on a cash card is 500,000 yen.
The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank will be lowered from October 1, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank will be lowered from November 1.
In the prefecture, there are many special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen by financial institutions and police officials, and those in the Shinkin Bank are sent out by ATMs.
After the sudden death of Chikakata ITSUTSU | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
The Japan Sumo Association announced on July 27 that it had approved the transfer of three sumo wrestlers from the Izutsu room, including Tsururyu YOKOTSUTSUNAGI and one Tokoyama, to the Mutsu room, following the death of Chikakata ITSUTSU (former Sekiwaki Ryobo).
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izu room.
His master, Chikakata MUTSU (former Kirishima Ozeki) was a brother of Chikakata ITSUTSU, who was from the Izutsu room.
On the 16th, Chikakata ITSUTSU died suddenly, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily detained in the same Kagamiyama room, and future treatment was discussed.
In the Mutsu room, there are 12 sumo wrestlers who are from Mongolia, the same as Tsururyu.
[Rugby W Cup] One-shot Departure & Struggle The "face risk tackle" of U.S. players is an overseas ripple "an insulting and cowardly play" - Yahoo! News
The US FL Quill is a rough play and former England representative, "It's not a tack."
The U.S. Rugby World Cup was the last game to be played in 20 countries, and was defeated by England in 7-45.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by FL John Quill in the latter half called a ripple.
This is done by adding a shoulder tuck to the face of the opponent.
The actual scene was also released with video footage, and former English players complained that it was "an insult and a cowardly play."
[Video] "A insulting and poor play" and overseas ripple!
The real moment of "face risk tackle" played by U.S. representative Quill.
A hot fight broke out.
It is the second half 29 minutes that I received at 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy's battle, the English captain Farrell was somewhat balanced when he caught his ally's path.
I went to Tackle.
However, he caused the upper body rather than the lower body from the waist and violently hit the upper body.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with each other, and they are in the shape of a head.
Farrell was blown away and collapsed.
The English protested against Quill's apparent lack of legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once, and it became an instant air.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle leaves with a red card.
Bates left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the audience asked him to boo.
Rugby's strong New Zealand local media "staff" is featured in the headline " Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave in poor play and England wins."
"Kill made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell, leaving him."
In the article, he introduced comments from the commentator Hugo Monya, who was a former English player.
"It's an insult, it's not a tack, it's a poor play."
The United States, which had lost one game, managed to escape the final loss in an attempt to win the game in 81 minutes.
However, Kyle's play left a bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), for the first time, announced the name of 424 hospitals in 1455 public hospitals in Japan and public hospitals such as Nika.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: the National Hospital Organization of Wara Hospital of Wara City; the Three Kingdom Hospitals of Soft Sakai City; the Oda Hospital of Echizen Town; and the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital of the town of Soft Takahama.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "the standards are strange."
In order to reduce medical costs, which are expanding due to the aging of the population, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we would like to request a full-scale review of the reorganization and consolidation of the target hospital and conclude by September next year.
There is no compulsion force, but it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to fears that close hospitals will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29.1%, with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43.3%).
The number of participants was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that could respond to "altitude acute phase" for severe patients and "acute phase" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medicine, and whether the competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need for publicizing the hospital's name.
The hospital is expected to be abolished and some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all the baby boomers were 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds in Japan to 12.46 thousand beds (18 years).
Currently, there are many beds for "altitude acute" and "acute" periods in which nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses are paid, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation services that are highly needed for elderly people.
In order to cope with aging, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the country is divided into 339 districts, local governments and medical officials are discussing it, many local residents and chiefs remain cautious and debate is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor results.
Comprehensive training for disaster prevention such as the assumption of the eruption of Mt.Komagatake, road etc.
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the woods, Nanae, and Kabe-cho in the Watari Island tube, assuming the eruption of Mt. Komagatake (1131 meters).
Approximately 400 people from 20 organizations and residents attended the event.
The first event since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating evacuation routes for residents in August.
It was the first time in 18 years that local residents participated in extensive training.
At 8:45 a.m., Mt. Komaga erupted and mud flow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were established in both Mori and Nanae towns, and residents moved by buses and police cars prepared by each town.

9 regions recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On March 27, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries released an amendment to the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of "Tonn cholera," an infectious disease of livestock.
The target area is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
Vaccination of live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but distribution of meat and processed foods outside the region is permitted.
It aims to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible through public comments to the general public.
By using vaccines and recognizing extraterritorial circulation such as meat, it is no longer a "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has been suspended for a while.
In the proposed amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set the "Recommended Areas for Vaccination" based on expert opinion regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The target prefecture creates a "vaccination program," which summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination, receives the approval of the province, and permits use by the governor's decision.
Seven other prefectures in Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga have been proposed for vaccination.
When the guidelines are revised, the region is extremely determined again.
Movements such as inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and waste products are restricted in principle to the region.
As for meat and processed products, they are not intended based on the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and they are virtually allowed to circulate outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we will thoroughly process food waste.
He is also involved in the prevention of harmful rumors by complaining about the safety of the inoculated pigs.
The revised guidelines were compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be conducted until October 7th, and new quarantine guidelines will be enforced.
Unaffiliated Keisuke Honda, an open approach to Man U!
"You don't need money" - Yahoo! News
September 28 (Sat) 2:57 delivery
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A League, and his former Japan representative, MF Honda Keisuke, has made an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, did you actually play the game?
the truth is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on 27th Japan time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world famous.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
It was published in the Australian edition of Fox Sports on 24 October.
In an article titled "The Five FWs Manchester United may seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie were Honda.
At present, United is suffering from injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Marcal, and FW Marcus Rushford.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Suhlshar, was forced to slip through the league with 2 wins, 22 losses, and faced challenges in front quality.
It was Honda that the Australian media named it as a candidate for a new force for Teco.
In the article, it is analyzed that Honda's contract as a creative side player, rather than a striker, could fill holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
Nine goals scored in Melbourne Victory's 18 games are "hard records," but it is also pointed out that "33-year-old Honda needs to take full attention away from his entertainment managing the Cambodian national team."
Is Honda's approach true?
It is also worth noting that United will move forward because of the veterans who say that next year's Tokyo Olympics will be the target.
500 portable translators completed installation Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores | Shizuoka Shimbun at Ess
PokeTalk, a portable translation machine that is loaned free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on June 26 that it had completed the installation of 500 portable translation machines at its member offices, including stores in Hamamatsu City, for free.
It is the first time in Japan to deploy the translator in a concentrated manner in the same region, and it is attracting attention whether it will improve the ability to respond to inbound travelers.
The loan includes 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodations and 134 others.
The city has 60% of its population.
The map app "Google Map" also started showing where to rent, so that the location of "stores for foreign languages" can be seen on the smartphone.
It is accessible from the Lake Hamana Tourism Area.
The free loan of PokeTalk, which corresponds to 74 languages, was launched in April by nine organizations in the city under the declaration of Hamamatsu, Japan's largest inbound support city.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
The representative of the Chamber of Commerce said, "I hope that the business environment is severe and will lead to the development of new foreign customers."
now, don't you need to tie up the first hit?
today's caddy's best shot.
1W shots are not necessarily tipping.
For example, if you want to earn a distance by hitting the second hit of par 5, you can hit a ball on the ground and use the so-called "naodra."
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which is associated with the risk of falling balls, but there are players who practice this frequently on the field.
Kanyo Ikemura is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
In his seventh year of professional career, he was 166 cm in height and is currently seventh in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
In early spring, he said, "I didn't have a shot of a spoon (3W), so I wanted to try Naodora."
The ball can be dropped from the practice round to the top of the grass in the Tire area, and it can also be sprinkled with 1W.
In the case where big carrie is required, many tiups are used, but both sides are used effectively in narrow halls.
"You can use it in a hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 to 280 yd in Carrie.
"That's why I don't need 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of admiration leaking from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"Even with a down blow, even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.If it's a cut track, I'm going to the right.I used to do a direct drag to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at Tiup time).
Although the ball does not catch, it is accompanied by risk of slice, "So the left side can be removed (not bent on the left).
It's a professional technique that makes you feel like you don't want to.

The original manuscript before Akutagawa's suicide was published for the first time.
Written by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, who was first published in Tabata Bunshimura Memorial Hall.
Writer Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA (1892-1927) wrote his essay "Shoku Bunshimura Memorial Hall in Kita Ward, Tokyo" which was published in his last years of fighting literature with Junichiro TANIZAKI.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1.

On September 26, Greta posted on his Twitter account, "Why do adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?"
i'll come up with as much lies and conspiracy theories as i can think.
Greta said, "Look, it started again, and as you notice, those who hate me are still active; they follow my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and where I am different from others; they come to think of as much as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
They also pointed out that they did not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they seemed to be distracting from the topic.
To be honest, I don't understand why adults spend time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
You can do another good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't consume your time to pay more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
It is changing.
Even if adults like that change, they don't like it.

Wedgeshot of Garcia
I could reach the level in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not able to stretch well.
did you see eagle 6 and bardy 7?
Even after I hit Boggy at #4, I still had a par 5.
No. 7 was a chance, but I regretted that I couldn't reach it later.
what did you get at this tournament?
Recently (shots) I didn't feel good, so I was glad that I was able to keep the fairways tight.
I learned a lot because I didn't have much experience.
what's the difference?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but the gallery was filming videos.
There wasn't much else that changed, but there were only a few Japanese players co-hosting the tournament, so I came to the game with the feeling that "I won't lose to foreign players."
I will continue in the second half of the game, but if I don't win more than one, I don't want to aim for the winning king, so I want to win another.
What is the method of preventing dementia and keeping it to the degree of " forgetfulness"?
Interview: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated with the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has become clear that it is possible to remain extremely mild and forget about things.
Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center Professor Shunsuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference in degree from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and there is no significant cure effect.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing and cancer deaths are decreasing due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual or family alone, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the region.
how to keep things to an extent
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable that you become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them "forget something."
Dementia is thought to be one of lifestyle-related diseases, and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in Metabo tend to be prone to dementia.
Dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence or absence of economic power.
For example, there are regions in the United States that distribute food tickets to the poor, but food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be stored.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in environments where they cannot cook can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a lifestyle that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
In the course of time, poverty, but obesity, and what you do is you have to look at TV vaguely, and you are physically disabled.
Similar situations can also be in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to read books daily and think about things that are not metabolized.
