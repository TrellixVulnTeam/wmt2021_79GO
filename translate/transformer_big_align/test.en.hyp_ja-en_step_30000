The driving in Hyhele is dangerous!
A number of young people's pedaling accidents have occurred - Yahoo! News
Conflicts in traffic law
It's a big mistake that I think it's a big mistake.
The number of incidents in the late 1990s have been reported to be more than 1080 years old and over 75 years.
It is important to call attention in the middle of the young age.
do you take my feet?
is it safe?
Although this data has not been described as gender ratios and causes, the difference between elderly people who are often considered to be due to the deterioration of the body, such as driving skills and reflection nerves, is likely to be due to the difficulty of playing music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the day's clothes, such as Heathle, Panps, sandals, Mule and Mule.
Some people know that driving is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility that they can lead to dangers.
However, the driving on high-heel and sandals is inconsistent with road traffic laws.
One of them is to ensure the operation of the handle, brakes and other operations of the brake, "If you don't want to drive to harm people with accidents?"
Another reason is that the driver must comply with the rules stipulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan in accordance with the provisions of the Article 71 of the Public Security Committee, for example, in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry of Road Traffic Act in Miyazaki Prefecture, there is no vehicle to wear clothes, or to prevent the operation of such equipment.
In each prefecture, it is similar to the aim of preventing driving from driving in "carcers that may prevent driving operations."
In the case, why is the driving in Hyhele?
It is obvious that it is clear to consider the basics of driving the pedal.
For safety-safe pedal operation, the first leg is fixed to the floor, and the foot is vertical to the brake pedal, and when you take the accelerator pedal, you will be able to pull the legs right.
At this time, it is important to make sure that the vehicle's behavior is not properly fixed, regardless of whether or not.
However, it is difficult to adjust the fine adjustment, however, due to the small size of the area surrounding the floor and the size of the ground on the floor.
This may lead to risk.
In addition, most of the cars are placed on the floor carpets, but this material can be easily pulled by a high-heel or a high-heel pedal at the time of the emergency brake, and the high-heel pulls off the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is also a case that Heel pulls on the back side of the pedal, leaving the accelerator pedal back.

The new fee plan of the mobile phone company was held in October due to the revision of telecommunications business.
However, it was almost abandoned.
However, despite the fact that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Japan stated that there was a room for lower than 40% in the summer, the price competition did not happen.
It is a major factor in the presence of three major companies.
For consumers, it is desirable that it is easy to use by fair competition.
They wanted to take advantage of their mobile phones.
The revised method prohibits a set discount of terminals and communication fees.
Instead of selling the terminals, it was because the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the device up to half.
However, for 100 days, both companies and other companies use the " SIMlock" system to operate the terminal.
NTT Dokomo is a third-minute device for only the company's contract.
The three companies also show that they continue to "contract" to prevent transfer from other companies.
For SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs expressed the policy that the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications would require immediate termination.
It is necessary to respond quickly to the corporate side.
The delay in the Heian period was not due to the development of communication networks such as the base station.
Just as expected to be a blaster in the competition, it was wearing a shoulder.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
It is not clear that the start of the full-service service and the cost of the service is not displayed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want to work with business with responsibility.
This was due to the revision of the charges of the Minister of the Interior.
"I think I'm going to start a competition in the future, but I don't think it's a good idea."
However, I don't think that the price reduction of the government does not seem to encourage the market to make a sound competition.
The company should continue to compete at the top of the customer's ranking before the government exits.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
In order to make advertising such as "the maximum half of the device," the consumer agency calls attention to the fact that the burden of consumers is over half.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, we must strive to carefully explain it.

How to prevent dementia?
i'm going to talk to you and talk to you.
A major pharmaceutical company and university hospitals challenge the development and development of dementia.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been clarified, and there is a possibility that there is a possibility that there is a possibility that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle can be kept very light.
I heard about Mr. Takatsuki, professor of stroke at Kinki University Hospital.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
There is a difference in the difference between the disease and the severity of the disease.
However, it is believed that new dementia drugs are being developed for more than 20 years.
The drugs used in Japan are often used in Japan, and some countries in overseas have already been exposed to insurance adaptability and are not expected.
On the other hand, the death of infectious diseases and accidents decreased, and cancer deaths decreased due to severe progress in treatment such as anticancers.
Therefore, the number of dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve your own or family, but it is necessary to prepare the environment to live safely in the whole society.
how do you keep it up?
Is there a person who can become dementia?
Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, it is possible to minimize symptoms as much as possible.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases, and people tend to tend to be easier.
First, the metabols are a tendency to become dementia.
dementia is one of the types of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol glucose.
It also affects whether or not economic power.
For example, in the United States there are areas where food tickets are distributed to poor food tickets, but food can be purchased by food tickets is a frozen hamberg or pizza.
You can't use gas or electricity, and people who live in the environment that cannot be cooked.
Then, when you eat less vegetables and proteins, you will be able to live with lipids and sugar.
After that, poverty becomes obesity, and if you're looking at TV, you can't see your body.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
Another trend is that people who don't think about things and do not work can become dementia.
