Driving in Heather is dangerous!
A number of accidents involving young people's pedals - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
It's a big mistake that I think it's only problem with older drivers.
In the case of an accident in the late 1990s, more than 1080 cases were compared to 24 years old.
The mistake is not much older than the elderly, but it is important to call attention to the younger generation.
do you take your feet?
do you take safety?
This data does not include gender ratios and causes, but the difference between elderly people who are considered to be due to the deterioration of the body, such as driving skills and reflection nerves, can be considered to be a mistake due to misinterpretations such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, panps, sandals, mulls, and the clothes of the day.
Some people know that they are not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility that they are dangerous.
However, the driving of the Heathle and the sandals is mortgaged by road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, and Article 70, which stipulates that the accident should not be able to harm people.
Another thing is that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the National Security Committee of each prefecture, for example, in accordance with the provisions of the Act on Road Traffic Act of Miyazaki Prefecture, there are shoes that prevent the operation of the wearer, or in a way that prevents the operation of the Heathle or others.
In each prefecture, it is similar to the aim of a violation of the operation of "suits that could prevent driving operations."
Why is the driving in Heheel dangerous?
It is obvious that it is based on the basics of pedal operation safely.
To ensure safe pedal operation, the foot is fixed to the floor, and the foot is perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when you step through the accelerator pedal, you can tilt your feet right.
At this point, it is important to firmly fix the vehicle's behavior, regardless of whether it's a car.
However, it is difficult to adjust finely, because the area surrounding the floor is small, and always the gragra and Brets, and the area where the foot of the legs are placed on the pedal is smaller than the size of the feet.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars are equipped with floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull the heather, and sometimes it is possible to take a pedal when it comes to an emergency brake.
In addition, there is a case where heel pulls on the back side of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and left the accelerator pedal.

What kind of mechanism is YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter, Kobayashi): Now, YouTuber's career is a lot of young people.
At the top of the career rankings that elementary school students want to do in the future, young people will continue to grow more and more.
Until now, we have adopted young people who have pursued dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, we adopted young people who are chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber and wanted to support them.
But why did you think that YouTuber is an independent video post?
Kobayashi: While many young people are interested in the profession of YouTuber, most YouTuber is the reality that YouTuber is not able to earn profits.
There are few creators who do not accept the existence of YouTuber in their family while working part-time.
In this effort, we will provide the environment for employees and content production.
At first, I think we will support our activities by supporting YouTuber, who will become unstable.

[The first half of the Battle of the Bado Olympics] The world champion Momota Kento and the strong Zhou Tensei lead a step forward!
Men's singles!
The Japanese national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Badminton, held in August, finished a reinforcement camp in early September and participated in the ChinaOP (present-day state/Super1000).
Here, we look forward to the first half of the Olympic Games in Tokyo from May to August, and we look forward to seeing the men's singles in the middle of the mid-season (from September to December).
At the end of the World Championships, Badminton's Olympic Games began in May, digested the top competition (Super 500 or more).
In the first half of the game, he won the 2nd prize in the 4th tournament, and two of them would have won the Taiwan Zhou Tensei.
Momota won the World Championships, and Tensei won the competition with the Indonesian OOP (S1000) and the high points of "World Rankings" that are directly linked to the Olympic Games.
Mita also has the JapanOP (S750).
The tournament held in May (May/China), IndonesiaOP (July/2007), JapanOP (July) and JapanOP (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce their burden on the body.
In August, only the World Championships were held in the World Championships, it would not be much fatigue than during the war.
In the mid-season of September, there is a need for good results.
Taiwan's Ace, which is strong in the fight.
Young people in Thailand!
He also won the top competition in Indonesia and ThailandOP (S500) in the top of the tournament.
He joined the local TaipeiOP (S300) in September and won the championship.
It was originally a heavyweight player who suffered a conflict.
There is no problem with the performance of the game.
Rather than winning a high point in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
It was an impression that Zhou Tensei had no explosive power until last year, but this year, the stability of the play was increased.
For Momota, the top ranking of the world rankings, it seems to be more difficult than ever.
In the first half of the game, the two players left the results in the first half of the game, but the young Ace Cantaphon and the Indian Cyclone B.
He is the third player of Unders Antonsen, who is struggling with the European forces.
Cantaphon won the top prize at the top of the competition, and he won the top in the second round.
Even though there is still a rough side, it is said that the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who was able to rally with the top players could be a leap in the Olympic Games.
Si Praneys B. also took a step in India with a single player.
Just as Samir rosema, Plato H.S. and Surikans Kidambi, who has been delayed due to injury, it is necessary to pay attention to the Indian forces after the mid-19th century.
The new cost of mobile phones and prices at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
The new cost plan of the mobile phone company, which was implemented in October, was introduced.
However, it was generally stopped.
However, the price competition did not occur despite the expectations for the reduction of the value.
It is a major factor in the existence of three major companies.
For consumers, it is desirable to be an easy-to-use fee system.
He asked for the efforts of the mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount of terminal and communication charges.
It was because it was set to increase communication fees instead of selling terminals.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize the terminal by half.
However, it is a mechanism for SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Dokomo is one of the largest and thirds of the terminal for only the company's contract.
The three companies will continue to "considence" to prevent transfer to other companies.
With regard to SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications agreed to require immediate removal.
The company must respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of telecommunications networks such as the base station.
Just as I was expected to be a striker at a price reduction competition, I was wearing a jacket.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
It is not clear that the start and fees of full-scale service are not provided.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
This change was made by the Secretary of the Cabinet.
Mr. Suga commented on the new charges of three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future."
However, I don't think that the government's price reduction would encourage a healthy competition.
The company should develop the competitive competition of the customer before the government exits.
The cost system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
On the other hand, the consumer agency called attention as there are cases where the burden of consumers exceeds half the amount of money.
As companies themselves do not want to make mistakes of users, they must try to understand and understand.

The medical results of nine items, including cancer and emergency medical care, analyzed whether a competitive hospital is located within 20 minutes by car, and determined the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital will be considered to be abolished or transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased by 25 years old and older than 75 years.
For this reason, the Ministry of Agriculture has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in hospitals in 1246,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute age" and " acute phase" of medical expenses, but there is a shortage of need for rehabilitation.

In response to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has established a regional medical concept, which includes the number of beds required for 25 years.
It is divided into 339 regions across the country, and many local residents and chiefs have a cautious attitude and discussion is difficult.

9 prefectures recommended for pig collector vaccines - Yahoo! News

The target area will select nine prefectures including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed by infection in pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of living pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccines is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is accepted.

The prefectural government will create a " vaccine vaccination program" that summarizes the scope of vaccination, time, head number, and direction of the target.
Other seven prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga, have been raised as recommendations for vaccination.
The area is highly determined when the guidelines were revised.
In principle, migrations such as vaccinated pork, semen, fertilized egg, body, and exhaustion are limited to the region.
For the sake and processing products, it is not subject to the effects of the cost of distribution and the impact of farmers on the impact of the distribution restrictions, and it is virtually acceptable to distribution outside the area.
To prevent viruses, we thoroughly process food waste.
In response to the safety of the infected pig, he also tries to prevent the damage of the wind.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized at the meeting of an expert meeting held on the same day, and confirmed at the meeting of the Headquarters for Prevention.

Now, Naodra's name, Kanji Ikemura, doesn't need to hit the first one?
the best shot today.
1W shot is not always good enough.
There is also a technique called " Naodra" when you want to earn distance in the second round of Per5.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, with the risk that the ball is scattered, but there are players who often practice on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze, who is waiting for the first victory in the tour.
The 24th year of the Pro7 year is 166 cm tall and is now 7th in the driving stance sector (average 304.02 yd).

"I don't have a spoon (3W) shot before spring, so I thought I would try Naodra."
From the practice round to the lawn of the Ti area, the ball has a potri and throws it off, and you can also shake 1W.
In the case where Big Care is required, both sides are used to make use of Naodra in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eyes are pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"I don't need 3W because I don't need 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood in Kaddy bag only 1W.
The second longest club is Loft 17.
I am happy to hear the feeling of leaking from the gallery that I saw.
The trick is to "the level of the club."
"I'm not going straight at the bottom, but I'm going to go right with a cut trajectory.It was originally a directdra to correct the swing correction of 1W shot.
If the ball is not caught, there is a risk of slice, so the left side can be removed (not to the left).
It's a professional technique that makes sense of it.

What is the way to prevent dementia?
Interviews, sentence, and yoyo Watanabe
One of the major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals is the drug of dementia that has failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated, and it is said that it may be possible to stay extremely light and forget.
I heard from Prof. Toshisuke Otsuki, a stroke center.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference between the disease and the severity of the disease.
However, it is thought that new dementia drugs are being developed for more than 20 years.
Drugs that are often used in Japan are already outside of insurance adaptations in some countries overseas.
On the other hand, the death of infectious diseases and accidents decreased, and the death of cancer has decreased due to severe advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
It is not possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment that can live safely in the whole society.
how to keep things up
What are those who are susceptible to dementia?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can reduce the symptoms as much as possible and keep it up to the extent of "see things."
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be easier for people.
First, Metabo people tend to be more prone to dementia.
dementia is one of the diseases of lifestyle.
The combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
It also affects economic power.
For example, in the United States there are areas where food tickets are distributed to poor food tickets, but food that can be purchased by food tickets is a frozen hamburger, pizza and chicken.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in a environment where they cannot cook.
If you eat a little bit of vegetables and protein, then you will be able to live with lipids and sugars.
At the end of the year, it is poverty, but if you look at TV, you will be blind.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
In other words, people who don't think about things are prone to dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day.
