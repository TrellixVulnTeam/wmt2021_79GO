Driving in Heheel is dangerous!
Many young people's pedal accident occurred - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
It is a big mistake that I think it is only a problem with older drivers.
The number of accidental accidents occurred during the period (2015 Police Agency data), with more than 1080 cases in the age of 24 and less than 1032 over 75 years.
The mistakes are not many elderly people, but it is important to call attention to the younger generation.
do you take your feet?
do you take safety?
There is no description of the gender ratio and cause of this data, but there is a difference between the elderly who think that driving skills and reflective nerves are often affected by the deterioration of the body, and there is a possibility that the young age group may take care of other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, some women choose a variety of shoes by wearing hiheel, panps, sandals, mulls, and the clothes of the day.
Some people know that they are not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility that they can lead to danger.
However, driving on high-heel and sandals has mortgaged road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that there is no need to drive to harm people with accidents.
Another thing is that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the National Public Security Committee in Article 71, "The violation of the compliance matters of the Public Security Committee," for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, "I wear shoes that interfere with the operation of the train or do not wear them in a way that hinders the operation of the Heel and others.
In each prefecture, it is similar to the intention that it is deemed to be a violation of the driving operation in "wear items that could prevent driving operations."
Why is the driving in Heheel dangerous?
It is clear to think about the basics of making pedals safe.
For safe pedal operation, the first leg is fixed on the floor, and the foot is placed vertically on the brake pedal, and when you step on the accelerator pedal, you can tilt it to the right.
At this point, it is important to keep firmly fixed, regardless of car behavior.
However, it is difficult to adjust finely, because the area surrounding the pedals is small and the area surrounding the floor is small, and always the gragra and Bret, and the area surrounding the pedal is smaller, so it is difficult to adjust.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars are equipped with floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull the heel or the heel when it comes to a brake, and sometimes the heel is pulled by the pedal, and the heel is removed from the beat and the heel is pulled away.
In addition, there are cases where heel pulls on the back side of the pedal, and the accelerator pedals are not returned.

"Mimi and ugly" is a paper heavy?
What is the image of " snakes" that overlaps the beauty girls of her works ( Magmix) - Yahoo! News

Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world, and the collection of "Babi-no-Omi Girls Collection" (Genmitsu Corporation) was released in August 2019.
When you take a look at it, you will notice the correlation between "mi" and "folk" of your work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
There are five beautiful girls who don't see them.
In the chapter of "Miya Girls Collection," there was a statement that "The horror, uglyness, the shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out with the beauty of the women in the extremes."However, since the contrast between the beautiful faces changed to the expression of distortion, resentment ..., there may be more fear than that.
There is a keyword called "a snake" to appear in many works, but the snakes are captured as a "extracious creature" by the viewer, and there are many people who feel "a beautiful" and receive it.
There are people who like reptiles in the world who don't really like them.
Thus, by the sensibilities of the viewer, "mi" and "gurity" may be a creature in the back of the table.
In addition, this creature has been worshipped as a highly spiritual creature since ancient times, and the house where "white snake" lived is said to be lucky.
In 1965, there is a series of "Tobi Girl" and "The Girl of Still."
It is the market that there is a beautiful woman who has a shadow.
Is it better to say "cooling" type? ...I feel that it is similar to those of the girls who appear in the Bai diagram.
Among them, "Ochi" is the main character of "Ochi," which was serialized in the Weekly Boys Sunday from 1969, and "Ochi" is a beautiful girl character that is the representative of the Bai figure, but it reminds us of a deep sleep every hundred years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

Immediately after this, Yemen's anti-government organization "Hosshi" announced a statement of crime.

With the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production stopped, and crude oil prices rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that oil shocks come back.
"I would like to avoid any military intervention until Trump's withdrawal from the Middle East and at least the next year's elections have ended, and Iran will continue to bomb the drones in hiding the Fusi faction, and the U.S. will not be able to endure forever."

The reason why the super personality YouTuber became a positive employee.
(BizSPA!)
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is the most popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use advertisements for their products, there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called " YouTuber adoption" in their own company.
It is a direct marketing mix (DMIX), which is the main business of corporate CRM (Customer Relations Management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, a subsidiary of YouTuber, and a representative of staff first.
i want to support young people working hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is the adoption of YouTuber?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter, Kobayashi): Currently, YouTuber's career has become a dream of many young people.
Elementary school students are in the top ranking of careers that want to be in the future.
Until now, we have adopted young people who are chasing dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, we adopted young people who are chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber and wanted to support them.
Why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are eager to become a profession called YouTuber, most YouTuber is the reality that most YouTuber is not profitable.
There are few creators who are working on video production and posting while working part-time, and creators who are not allowed to recognize the existence of YouTuber to their families.
This initiative provides the environment for pay and content production for creators who are employed.
At first, we believe that we will support the benefits of the occupation of YouTuber, which will become unstable.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA" U.S. Secretary-General of the United States - Yahoo! News
On 27 November, the U.S. Secretary-General of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs of Korea and Japan announced that the Japan-Korea Military Information Protection Agreement (GSOMIA) would like Korea to reconsider its decision to destroy Korea.
It is unusual that U.S. officials refer to the re-establishment of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan and Japan, the U.S. and the U.S. to share missile launch information.
When Korea destroyed the agreement between Japan and Japan in August, a framework to protect military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
Mr. Napper said, "We cannot effectively respond to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There's time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
In addition to the joint flight training conducted over the Sea of Japan in July, Nakaro expressed the threat recognition as "the first time in history."
In recent years, the deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea has pointed out that "the U.S. national interests will hurt."
"There's no intention of intermediation," he said, "It's a positive role to be able to separate Japan and Korea."

In the first half of the Bado Olympic race, the world champion, Toshio Momota, and the strong Zhou Tensei lead a step.
Men's singles.
Japan's national team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Badminton, held in August, finished the training camp in early September, and participated in the China OOP (normal state/Super1000).
Here, we will look back at the first half of the Olympic Games in Tokyo from May to August, and look forward to seeing the men's singles for the mid-September and December.
At the end of the World Championships in May, Badminton's Olympic Games digested the top tournament (Super 500 or more).
In the first half of the game, he won the 2nd prize in the 4th tournament, and two of them would have won the Taiwan Zhou Tensei.
Momota won the World Championships, the Zhou Tensei (S1000) and the Indonesia OOP (S1000) and the high points of "World Ranking Points" that are directly connected to the Olympic Games.
Momota also has the JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May (May/China), Indonesia OOP (July 16 strong), JapanOP (July), and JapanOP (August).
Compared to other top players, there are few schedules to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only the World Championships were held at the World Championships, the fatigue would not be greater than the war.
In the mid-September quarter, the higher-level competition will be required.
Taiwan's Aces with strong fighting.
Young people in Thailand!
He also won the top competition in Indonesia's OOP and ThailandOP (S500) and was already in seven competitions.
In September, he participated in the local Taipei OP (S300), and won the championship.
He is a very strong player who does not want to fight.
There is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament to participate in the first half.
Although Zhou Tensei was impressed by the lack of explosive power until last year, he was able to continue his good performance by increasing the stability of the play this year.
For Momota, one of the world's top rankings, he seems to be a big opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, he took the lead in the first half of the match, but was a young Ace Cantaphone in Thailand and a Cy Planety B. in India.
He is the third player of Unders Antonsen, who is struggling with an isolated army in Europe.
Kantaphon won the top prize in the second round of the tournament, and he won the top prize.
There is still a rough side, but it seems that the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who was able to rally with top players was able to make a leap in the Olympic race.
Si Praneys B. also took a step in India, where players were able to compete with singles.
Just as Samir Baluma, Pranii H.S. and Surikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, need attention to India's forces after the mid-stage battle.

NTT Dokomo is one of the largest and three-thirds of the terminal's contracts.
The three companies also show that they continue to "reach" to prevent changes to other companies.
With regard to SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications decided to immediately cancel the SIM lock.
The company must respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of telecommunications networks such as the base station.
Just as I expected to be a striker at a price reduction competition, I was wearing a shoulder.
I think there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-fledged services are not clear.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
This change led to the announcement by Secretary of State Suga.
Mr. Suga commented on the new price of three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, but I don't think it's good enough."
However, I don't think that the government's price reduction will ease the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop a competitive competition at the customer base before the government exits.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Agency called attention as there are cases where consumer burdens exceed half of the amount of advertising such as "the maximum half of the device."
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, companies must try to explain it in politeness.

With nine medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, a competing hospital analyzed whether it was within 20 minutes of car, and judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital is subject to consideration of the abolition and the transfer of some medical departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased by 25 years, when all of the group's population was 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in hospitals with 124,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute phase" and " acute phase" of medical expenses, but there is a lack of need for rehabilitation.

Ministry of Agriculture, Gifu Shimbun Web - Yahoo! News
On 27 days, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a revision of the prevention guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock infectious diseases, such as pigs, in order to prevent the spread of infection.
The aim is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed by infection in pigs and wild boars.
The movement of living pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccines is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is accepted.
After public comments (approved by opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October.
By using vaccines, it is possible to eliminate the "clean country" certified by international organizations and influence the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan's status was temporarily suspended.
In the revision, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up the recommended area for vaccination, based on the opinion of experts on areas where the risk of infection from wild boars to pigs is high.
The prefectural government will create a " vaccination program" that summarizes the scope of vaccination, time, head count, and direction of the province, and confirms the province and allow it to be used by the governor's judgment.
Other seven prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, have been raised as recommendations for vaccination.
The area is determined very once the guidelines were revised.
Moves such as occupant pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and exhaustive objects are restricted in principle.
In terms of meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact of farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
They also appeal to the safety of the infected pigs and prevent the damage caused by the wind.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized at the meeting of an expert meeting held on the same day, and confirmed at the meeting of the Headquarters for Anti-Demomination.

"You don't need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57
As far as last season, he left Melbourne Bactley, Australia's A-League, and Keisuke MF Honda, the former member of the Japan National Team, took an amazing action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth of heaven is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter Twitter at midnight, Japan Time: "If you don't need money, you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent "inverse offers" is Manchester United, a world-famous gate.
Why did Honda have a grand request to the Premier League's most powerful club?
It was featured in the Australian edition "FOX Sports."
In the article titled "The Manchester United is a five-member FW that could be captured in the aftermath of the injury," there were five non-partisan players who could now earn.
Among the players such as Hathm Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, Wilfed Boney, there was also the name of Honda.
In the United States, injuries such as the FMF Pole Pogba, the DF Luke Show, DDF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Martial, FW Marcus Rushford, and others have been in an emergency.
The Red Devil, led by Ole Günner Sulshire, was forced to win 22 defeats and slips in the league, and faced challenges in the quality of the front line.
Thus, the Australian media named him as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, "Strictly speaking, the contract of Honda as a creative side player is analyzed not as a striker, but can be buried in a hole filled by Andreas Pelella."
The score of 9 points in 18 matches in Melbourne Victori is "hard record," but "The 33-year-old Honda has to leave his entertainment to manage Cambodian representative, and has to attract full attention."
What is the approach of Honda?
For the next year's Tokyo Olympics to be held in Tokyo, it is also noteworthy that the United will move.

"PokeTalk" is a mobile translation machine that lends free to 500 stores in Hamamatsu city.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on 26th that it had completed a total of 500 stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is said to be the first country to deploy the same translation machine into the same region, and it is noted that it will lead to improvement in the ability to respond to Inbound (Japanese travelers who visit Japan).

Now, Naodra's name, Kanyo IKEMURA doesn't need to hit first.
the best shot today.
1W shot is not always tipping.
There is also a technique called " Naodra," which is so-called when you want to earn a distance in the second round of Per5.
In recent years, since the head volume is large, there is a risk that the ball is scattered, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze, who can wait for the first victory in the tour.
The 24-year-old professional age is 166 cm tall and is now 7th in the driver's stance.
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
It was not possible to shoot a spoon (3W) before spring, so I thought I would try Naodra.
From the practice round to the lawn of the Ti area, the ball is dropped and the ball is cut off by 1W.
In the case where Big Carrie is required, it is widely used for Tiup, but both sides are used to effectively utilize Naodra in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is down."
He recorded 27yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"So I don't need 3W.Caddy can be more secure than 3W."
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood was only one W in Cady Bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17.
I am also happy to hear the feeling of leaking from the gallery that I saw.
The trick is that the club behaves at the level ( horizontal).
"But I can't fly straight at the top, and I'm going to the right with a cut track.It was originally a direct drag to correct the swinging of 1W shot (time of Tipup).
Although the ball is not caught and accompanied by the risk of slices, "So the left side can be removed (not bent on the left).
It's a professional skill that I can't understand.

How do you prevent dementia and keep things forgotten?
Interviews and Statements by Watanabe
The major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated, and it seems that it may be possible to maintain extreme mildness and forgotten things.
Mr. Toshisuke Otsuki talked to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki The difference between mildness and severity is that everyone may become dementia after age.
However, it is still thought that new dementia drugs are being developed for more than 20 years.
The drugs that are commonly used in Japan are already outside insurance adaptations in some countries overseas, and the remarkable completion effect cannot be expected.
On the other hand, the deaths of infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths are declining due to severe progress in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
It is not possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment where society can live safely.
how to keep things up
Is there anyone who is easy to become dementia?
Otsuki Even if dementia is inevitable, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep it in the degree of forgotten things.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be an easy person.
First, Metabo people tend to be more prone to dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
