Driving in Heel is dangerous!
The mistake of pedaling young people has occurred frequently - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
It's a big mistake to think that it's only a problem with older drivers.
According to data from the National Police Agency (2015), there are more than 1080 cases in the age of 24 and above 1032 cases over 75 years.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well as the elderly.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, there is a possibility that the young age group is distracted by other things such as music, conversation, etc.
In particular, some women choose various shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, panps, sandals, and mulls.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people are worried about changing their shoes, but some people don't think about the possibility that they can lead to danger, and many people are driving bad.
However, driving on high heels and sandals is in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brake and other operations, and Article 70, which stipulates that "No driving should be made to harm people with accidents."
The other is Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters set by the prefectural public security committee, for example, in Article 12 of the Act on Road Traffic in Miyazaki Prefecture, "I wear shoes that prevent the operation of high heels, or wear them in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle (except light vehicles).
The purpose of each prefecture is to consider a violation of the operation of a footwear that could prevent operation even if it is not specified as a high-heel.
So why is it dangerous to drive in Heheel?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe pedal operation, first place the foot or foot on the floor and place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the car does not fit regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, because the height of the heel and the height of the heel are equal to the angle of the foot, the area of the foot on the pedal is smaller and the size of the foot is small, the fine adjustment is difficult.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull the heel or the heel, and when it comes to a sudden brake, the heel is pulled by the pedal, and the heel is removed from the beat and the heel is pulled away.
In addition, in some cases, heel was pulled to the back side of the pedal when he stepped on the pedal and the accelerator pedal was no longer returned.

"Aba Beer, an Iranian drone used in this bombing, has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing drones from the US Army that crashed.
It is cheap and can be manufactured, with a distance of about 1000 km.
It is also a strength that is hard to catch radar because it flies low air."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fushi" issued a statement of crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Fusi faction, led by President Rohani, who cannot allow Saudi Arabia to produce crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Sugawara, an international political analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped, and oil prices rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock returns.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until Trump's withdrawal from the Middle East, at least until the next year's election ends," said Mr. Sugawara, "I don't think Iran will continue to bomb drones in hiding the Fusi faction, but the U.S. will not endure forever.

Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
I asked the president who hired me.
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use their own products for advertising, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption" that is employed as regular employees in their company.
Direct marketing mix (DmMiX), a company that mainly operates CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is the CEO of DmiX, is also the representative of the company and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who are working hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now, YouTuber's profession is adored by many young people.
At the top of the career ranking for elementary school students who want to work in the future, the number of young people who are aiming for the future will increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, we will adopt young people who are chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber and support them.
Why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, most YouTubers have a reality that they don't have a profit as they thought.
There are many creators who are making and posting videos while working part-time, and creators who are not allowed to recognize their family as YouTuber.
This initiative provides the environment for salary and content production for creators who are employed.
At first, we will support the benefits of YouTuber's profession, which will become unstable.

Napper said, "I can't respond effectively to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted over the Sea of Japan in July also marked the threat of "the first time in history."
In recent years, the deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea has pointed out that it will hurt the U.S. national interests.
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "It will play a positive role in the separation between Japan and Korea."

He is very strong and does not suffer a series of battles.
As the tournament continues, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, by gaining high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Although Zhou Tensei had an impression that it lacked explosive power until last year, it was possible to continue his good grades by increasing the stability of the play this year.
For Momota, one of the world's top rankings, he seems to be a big opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, he left the game in the first half, with a young Ace Cantaphon in Thailand and Cy Planetia B. in India.
He is the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who is struggling for an isolated army in Europe.
Cantaphon does not reach the top level in the tournament, but he will win the top in the second round.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old on 18th) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step in India, where he played a single player.
Samir Balama, Platoon H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been delayed due to injury, will be caught up in the future, so attention should be paid to the Indian forces after the mid-season.
New rates on mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
A new fee plan for the mobile phone company was introduced in October due to the enforcement of the revised telecommunications business law.
However, it was generally stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said that in the summer of last year, there was room for less than 40%, but the price competition did not happen even though expectations were high.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been sent forward and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be an easy-to-use pricing system for fair competition.
I want to ask the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of being sold to the terminal, the communication fee was reduced.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize and half the terminal.
However, for 100 days between the two companies, SIM locks are not available for other companies.
NTT Docomo is one-third of the terminal size for only the contractor on the line.
The three companies will continue to "interface" to prevent transfers to other companies.
With regard to SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications required immediate termination.
The company also needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the construction of a communication network such as the base station.
I was expected to be a detonator of the price reduction competition, so I was wearing a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-fledged services are not clear.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
This change led to the announcement by the Secretary of State Kanbo.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to remain."
However, I don't think that the government's price reduction will ease the market and encourage healthy competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before the government exits.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention as there were cases where consumer burdens exceeded half the amount of advertising such as "the maximum half of the device."
We must try to explain politely and easy to understand so that companies do not make mistakes of users.

[ Rugby World Cup] I'm going to go out and fight against the U.S. player's face-to-face dangerous tackle.
U.S. FLkyle is a rough play and former English representative, not a tackle.
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was the last of the 20 countries to be held in England on 26 October.
It was a black star, but a rough play played by Fred John Kyle later called a ripple.
In a way to add a shoulder tack to the opponent's face, he dropped out.
The actual scene was released by foreign media and video, and former English athletes complained that "not to call tackle."
[Video] "It's an insult and cowardly play" and overseas ripple!
At the moment of the actual moment of "face danger tackle" played by the U.S. representative Kyle.
The hot fighting force crossed the line.
It is 29 minutes later that I picked up at 0-38.
When the English captain Farrell caught his side's path, he fell in balance.
I went to Tuckar this was Kyle.
However, the upper body was not lower than the waist, and the upper body was severely damaged.
As a result, the contact between the head and the head of the opponent is made, and it is shaped like a head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
The English protested against the fact that the English player would fly Kyle to play clearly lacking legitimacy.
The two men gathered together at a moment and became air-conditioned.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out of red card.
Bates later pitched in a bad face, but some of the audience asked for fair play.
The local media staff of New Zealand's strong rugby union team is featured in the headlines: Rugby World Cup 2019: The U.S. players dropped out of the game, and England won the game.
"Kill had a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and turned out to be a retreat."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the commentator Hugo Moña.
"It's an insult, and it's not called a tackle," he said.
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the final defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first 424 hospital names in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan that "there is no clinical record."
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted at the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital in Kokohama-cho, Oda Hospital in Echizen-cho.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "standards are strange."
Due to the aging of the population and the expansion of medical costs, it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in the competitive area.
In October, we requested a full-fledged review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital and decided to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, it is expected that the local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety about the disappearance of a nearby hospital.
It was announced at the same time.
The target hospital was 29 percent of the total, and the number of beds was relatively small.
In prefectures, Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48,6 percent), Miyagi (47,5 percent), Yamaguchi (46,7 percent) and Okayama (43,3 percent).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare investigated the "Advanced acute phase" for severe patients, and 1455 hospitals capable of performing general surgery.
Nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, analyzed whether a competing hospital was located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital is expected to be closed and some medical departments are transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the clustered generations were 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in hospitals nationwide to 1191,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute phase" and " acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical costs are expensive, but there is no need for rehabilitation for elderly people.
In order to cope with aging, the number of beds should not only be reduced, but also increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture established a "regional medical concept" that defined the number of beds necessary for 25 years.
The area is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing, but many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance and discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital that has little experience.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a revision of the anti-demiological guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock infectious diseases, "tann cholera," which would enable preventive vaccination against domestic pigs that are not currently recognized.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The transfer of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is accepted.
After public comments to the general public, etc., we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and accepting extraterritorial distributions such as meat, it is possible to eliminate the "clean country" certified by international organizations and influence the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan's status of cleanliness was temporarily suspended.
In response to the opinion of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination in response to the high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The prefecture is subject to the creation of a vaccine vaccination program that summarizes the range, time, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, have been raised as recommendations for vaccination.
When the guidelines were revised, the situation was decided very again.
Movements such as vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and exhaustives are restricted in principle.
As for meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact of farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
It is also used to promote the safety of the infected pig and to prevent damage to the wind.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized by an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasures Headquarters.
In the future, the prefecture's opinion inquiries and public comments will be conducted until October 7th, and the new preventive protection guidelines will be enforced.

Why did Honda request a grand request to the most powerful club in the Premier League?

Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonney, Honda was named.
At present, injuries such as MF Pole Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Martial, and FW Marcus Rushford have been in an emergency.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Sulscherle, was forced to win 22 games in the league, and had challenges in front quality.
It was Honda who named the Australian media as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, "It is not strictly a striker, but as a creative side player, Honda's contract can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Perilla."

Now, Naodra's name, Kanyo IKEMURA, doesn't need to hit first?
today's caddy's best shot.
The 1W shot is not always up and hit.
There is also a technique called " Naodra," which is the so-called ball on the ground when you want to earn distance in the second round of Per 5.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, and there is a risk that the ball is scattered, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory in the tour.
The 24-year-old Pro7 is 166 cm tall and is currently 7th in the driving direction category (average 304.02 yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
"I thought I would try Naodra because I couldn't shoot spoon (3W) before spring."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball on the lawn of the Ti area, and you can also sprinkle 1W.
In the case where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but both sides are used to effectively utilize Naodra in narrow halls.
You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in carrie.
"So I don't need 3W."Caddy can be more relieved than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cady bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of lamenting leaks from the gallery that I saw.
The trick is to act the club horizontally.
"But even if I hit the top, I didn't fly straight.I went to the right with a cut track.It was originally a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
If the ball is not caught and accompanied by a risk of slice, the left side can be erased (not bent on the left).
It's a professional technique that I don't want to know.

Political commentators said on the American television show that Greta was "a mentally ill and used for parents and international left."
In Japan, on the Internet, there are many reports on Mr. Greta's comments, such as "It is used and cute."
On September 26, Mr. Greta posted on Twitter, "Why do people use time to laugh and threaten teenagers and children?"
i'm thinking about lies and conspiracy theories as far as possible.
Mr. Greta said, "As you notice, the people who hate me are as active as ever.My appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and I'm going to follow a different place with people, and they start posting, thinking about as long as possible lies and conspiracy theories."
And the great people did not want to face the climate and environmental crisis, but they pointed out that they seemed to have a problem with the story.
I don't understand why the big people laugh and spend time threatening teenagers and children.
It would be better at that time.
I wonder if they feel threatened to us.

I thought it would be possible to reach the momentum in the second half, but it was regrettable because the patter was not able to grow well.
i saw the sixth eagle, the seventh bardy win?
Even after I hit Boggy on the 4th, there were still 5 people, so when I was feeling back, the chip-in eagle was on the 6th.
In the seventh place, Bardy was able to get the chance, but it was regrettable that he couldn't reach the second half.
what did you do now?
I didn't feel good recently, so I was glad that Fairway was able to make a key even in a narrow course.
It was a course where roughness and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.

I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming videos.
I didn't have much changed, but because I was just co-hosted and there were few Japanese players, I felt that I would not lose to overseas players.

Interviewed and written by Yuki Watanabe
Large pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenge R&D and are struggling with dementia drugs.
However, it seems that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated and it is possible to remain extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital Dr. Toshisuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki From mild to severe, there is a possibility that everyone will become dementia after age.
However, it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug called Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and it is not expected to be a significant complete effect.
On the other hand, the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths are declining due to the drastic advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
It is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment where society can live with peace as a whole.
how to keep things up
- Are there people who are prone to dementia and are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and to keep the symptoms as possible.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be easy to become.
First, people in metabol tend to become dementia.
dementia is one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the U.S., there are areas where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food that can be purchased by food tickets is frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people who live in an environment where they cannot cook.
If you eat less vegetables and protein, you will become a fat and sugary lifestyle.
In the end, it is poverty, but it becomes obese, and if you want to see TV, you will be able to see the body.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who don't think about things or don't work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day and think about things.
