Driving at high heels is dangerous!
A number of incidents involving young people pedaling - Yahoo! News
violation of road traffic laws
It's a big mistake to think that it's only a problem with older drivers.
According to the National Police Agency data (2015), there are more than 1080 cases in the age of 24 and above 1032 cases over 75 years.
It is important for young adults to call attention as well.
do you take your feet?
do you take safety?
There is no description of the gender ratio or cause of this data, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, there is a possibility that the young age group may take care of other things, such as music, conversation, etc., and make mistakes due to accidental mistakes or clothing.
In particular, women choose various shoes depending on their clothes, such as high-heel, panps, sandals, and mulls.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people are worried about changing their shoes, but some people don't think about the possibility that they can lead to danger, and many people are driving bad.
However, high-heel and sandal driving violate road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brake and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that "No driving should be made to cause accidents and harm people."
Another reason is that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural government security committee in Article 71 of the "Disclosure of the Public Security Committee," for example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, "I wear footwear in a way that prevents the operation of the car (except light vehicles) and does not drive vehicles (except light vehicles).
In each prefecture, even though it is not specified as a high-heel, it is similar to the intention to consider a violation of driving in "the footwear that could prevent driving operations."
So why is it dangerous to drive at Heir?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedal operation safely.
To ensure safe pedal operation, first place the foot or foot on the floor and place the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep firmly fixed so that the car doesn't fit regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in the high heels, the area surrounding the floor is small, and the area around the floor is always filled with grammas, and because the height of the heel has an angle to the entire foot, the area surrounding the pedal is smaller and the area of the foot is smaller, making it difficult to make fine adjustments.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull from either a heel or a heel, and sometimes a pedal is pulled by a heel when it comes to a sudden brake, or a heel is removed from the heels, and the heel is removed from the heel to the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is a case where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

"The real culprit who attacked Saudi oil facilities" - Yahoo! News
"Aba Beer, a Iranian drone used in this bombing, has improved dramatically in recent years by analyzing the drones of the US military that crashed.
It is cheap and can be manufactured, with a distance of about 1000 km.
To fly low air, it's hard to catch radars."
On September 14, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Ramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after this, the Yemeni anti-government organization "Fusi" issued a statement of crime.
"There is no doubt that Iran is Iran, led by President Rouhani, and Iran cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Sugawara, International Political Analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production stopped and oil prices rose by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock will return.
"I don't want to avoid any military intervention until Trump's withdrawal from the Middle East, at least until the end of the next year's election, and Iran will continue to bomb drones on the hideout of the Fusi faction, and the U.S. will not endure forever."
The United States and Iran's "signal war" are facing an immediate crisis.
Why YouTuber became a regular employee?
When asked by the president (bizSPA!)
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
Although it is not uncommon for companies to use their own products for advertising, there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption" in their own company.
It is a direct marketing mix (DmMiX), a company that mainly operates CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, Representative Director and Representative Director of DMIX, who is also the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber, talked about it.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now, YouTuber's profession is a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are entering the top rankings in their career rankings for the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, using young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber and trying to support them is the adoption of YouTuber.
But why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the profession of YouTuber, most YouTuber is a reality that they don't have the income they thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working part-time jobs, and creators who don't recognize the existence of YouTuber to their families.
This initiative provides the environment for paid and content creation to the creators employed.
At first, we will support the benefits of YouTuber's profession, which will become unstable.

"Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of State - Yahoo! News
In response to an interview at the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo on 27th, Mr. Napper said, "We hope Korea will reconsider its decision and return to Korea."
It is unusual that U.S. officials refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA destruction.

South Korea will destroy Japan's agreement in August and the framework to protect military information will collapse if it is notified or revocation.
Napper said, "No GSOMIA can respond effectively to the crisis."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted over the Sea of Japan in July also showed the threat of "the first time ever in history."
In recent years, the deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has been pointed out as "aggravating U.S. national interests."
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "Japan and Korea play a positive role to fill apart.

[The first half of the Bado Olympic Games] World Champion Mototo Momota and the strong Zhou Tensei lead a step!
"The Men's Singles."
Japan's national team won six medals at Badminton's Big Event in August and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland.
Here, we look back at the first half of the Olympic Games that took place next year in Tokyo from May to August.
Badminton's Olympic Games began in May, and at the end of the World Championships, he digested the top four competitions (Super 500 or more).
In the first half of the game, Kento Momota, who won the 2nd prize in the 4th tournament, and Shutensei in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championships and Zhou Tensei won the competition with Indonesia OP (S1000) and the world ranking points directly connected to the Olympic Games.
Momota also has JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May (May/China), Indonesia OP (July 16 strong), JapanOP (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, so the fatigue would not be much greater than the war.
In the mid-term competition from September onwards, a favorable outcome is required.
It is a Taiwan Ace that is resistant to fighting.
Young Thai people are also interested!
Sutennari, who also won the top tournament of the Indonesian OP and the Thai OP (S500), has already won seven tournaments.
He joined the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the championship.
He is a very strong player and does not suffer from fighting.
As the tournament continues, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Although Zhou Tensei had an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, he was able to continue his good grades by increasing the stability of the play in this year.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, he seems to be a tough opponent than ever.
In the first half of the game, two other players left the results in the first half of the game, with the young Ace Cantaphone in Thailand and the Cy Planets B. in India.
He is also the third player of Unders Antonsen, who has been fighting for Europe.
Although Cantaphon does not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he won the top in the second round.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a great potential to leap into the Olympic Games.
Cy Praneys B. also took a step in India, where players from singles were selected.
Samir Balama, Pranii H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is late due to injury, will also catch up in the future.
New rates on mobile phones Price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new pricing plan for mobile phone companies was introduced to the enforcement of the revised telecommunications business law.
However, it was generally stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room for less than 40%," and despite the high expectations of lowering prices, the price competition did not happen.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been forwarded and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
For consumers, it is desirable that fair competition makes it easy to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the device up to half.
However, both companies use SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO makes up to three-thirds of the terminal line's subscribers.
The three companies continue to "enclosure" to prevent transfers to other companies.
With regard to SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy requiring immediate termination.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the construction of a communication network such as the base station as planned.
It was expected that the price reduction competition would be explosives, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.
The start and rate of full-scale service is not clear.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to take responsibility and work on business.
This revision led to the remarks by the Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it would be good at that."
However, I don't think that the government's price reduction will ease the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before the government exits.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention as there were cases where consumer burdens exceeded half of the total amount of advertising such as "maximum half."
In order to avoid misunderstandings by companies themselves, we must try to explain polite and easy to understand.

When the English captain Farrell caught his opponent's path, he fell in balance.
I went to Tackle this was Kyle.

As a result, the contact between the head and the head of the opponent, and the shape of the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
The English protested against a clear lack of legitimacy in the play.

On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first of the 424 hospital names in 1455 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan that the number of medical records was poor.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare reviewed the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted at the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital in Kohama-cho, Oda Hospital in Echizen-cho.
⇒ 4 hospitals that are subject to reorganization "standards are strange."
In order to reduce the medical costs of aging and expanding, it was necessary to promote reorganisation and integration with hospitals in competing areas.
In October, we asked for a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital and decided to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, it is expected that local chiefs and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that the nearby hospital will disappear.
It was announced at the meeting the same day.
The total number of hospitals was 29 and 1%, and the number of beds was relatively small.
In prefectures, Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47, 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7 percent), Okayama (43.3%) were higher.
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals for "high acute phase" for severe patients and "acute period" for general surgery.
He analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and analyzed whether a competing hospital was located within 20 minutes of a car, and judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital will be closed and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the clustered families were 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds in 18 years to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute phase" and "acute period" where nurses are carefully placed and medical expenses are paid, but there is a shortage of demand for rehabilitation for elderly people.
In order to cope with aging, the number of beds should not only be reduced, but also increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defines the number of beds required for 25 years.
The area is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing, but many local residents and chiefs maintain their cautious stance and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with little results.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries ( Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a revision of the Anti-Defection Guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock infectious disease "Tann cholera," which allows preventive vaccination against domestic pigs that are not currently recognized.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild boars.
The movement of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed foods is recognized.
After public comments (approving opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it is possible to eliminate the "clean country" certified by international organizations and influence the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan has temporarily suspended its status as a clean country.
In light of the opinions of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up the recommended area for vaccination, based on the opinions of experts regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The prefecture will create a vaccine vaccination program that summarizes the scope, time, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Seven other prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, have been raised as recommendations for vaccination.
The area is determined very once the guidelines are revised.
The movement of vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and ovulations is basically limited to the region.
For meat and processed goods, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact of farmers, and it is practically acceptable to distribution outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, thorough processing of food waste.
Indicates the safety of pigs inoculated, and is also involved in prevention of rumors.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized at the meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Countermeasures Headquarters.
In the future, the prefectural government will make inquiries and public comments to the prefecture until October 7 and implement new preventive measures.

The other person who sent "reverse offers" is Manchester United, a world-famous gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request for the premier league club?
It was featured in the Australian edition FOX Sports, released on 24 October.
In an article titled "Manchester United's Five FWs," five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi, and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda was named.

Now, the name of Naodra, Kanyo IKEMURA, doesn't need to hit first?
today's caddy's best shot.
The 1W shot is not always up and hit.
There is also a technique called "directdra" that wants to make a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance in the second round of par5.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, which involves risk of losing the ball, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
His 24th year of professional career is 166 cm tall and he is currently 7th in the driving stance category (average 304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
At the beginning of spring, "I thought I would try Naodra because I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W).
From the practice round, you can drop the ball on the lawn of the Ti area and sprinkle the ball with 1W.
In the case where big carrie is required, it uses a lot of tiup, but both sides make use of direct drag in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in Carrie.
"So I don't need 3W, and Cady is more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood was only one W in the Cady Bag.
The second longest club is the Loft 17th UT.
I am also happy to hear the words of lamenting leaks from the gallery that I saw.
The trick is to "make the club level horizontally."
"But even if you hit the upper, you can't fly straight.I went to the right with a cut track.I originally had a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
Although the ball does not catch and involves the risk of slice, "So the left side can be erased (no turn left).
It's a professional skill that you can't imagine.

Weedge shot in Garcia
I was able to reach the momentum in the second half because I was able to reach the level of the first half.
Did you see the sixth Eagle, seventh bardy?
Even after hitting Boggy on the 4th, Par 5 remained, so if I had a feeling of returning, I had a chip in Eagle on the 6th.
In the seventh place, Bardy was able to get a chance, but it was regrettable that he couldn't continue in the second half.
what did you do now?
Recently, I didn't feel good at shooting, so I was glad that Fairway was able to pick up even a narrow course.
It was a course where roughness and reverse eyes were separated and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between regular competitions?
It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care about it at all, but I was filming videos.
I didn't have any other changes, but I just co-hosted a competition with fewer Japanese players.
We will continue to fight in the second half, but if we don't win more than one, we would like to win another so we can't aim for the winning king.

Kinki University Hospital A stroke center I talked to Professor Toshisuke Otsuki.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference between mildness and severity.
However, it is still thought that it takes more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drug called Donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, has already been out of the insurance adaptation in some countries overseas, and it is not expected that significant completion effects will be achieved.
On the other hand, the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have been declining due to intense advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve it by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment that can live safely in the community as a whole.
How to keep things forgotten
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is hard to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and stay at the level of forgetting.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be easier for people.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the U.S., there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food tickets are available in frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in an environment that cannot be cooked in the first place can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with little vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and sugars.
Eventually, it becomes poverty but obese, and if you want to do it, you can only see the TV, and your body will be disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who don't think about things or don't work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to read books from day to day and think about things.
