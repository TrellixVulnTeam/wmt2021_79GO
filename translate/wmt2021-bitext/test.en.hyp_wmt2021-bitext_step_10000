However , driving in both sides and sand@@ als is a road traffic law .
One is " Hand@@ le , brake and other operations " that ensure that the accident must be a harmful driver " Article 70 " safety violation .
The other is the Article 71 that the drivers must comply with the requirements set by each Public Safety Committee , which will prevent the operation of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Act .

For a safe ped@@ al operation , first fixed the foot ped@@ al to the ped@@ al floor , turn the legs to be straight against the brakes , and take the ped@@ al right .
At this point , it is important to keep it firm and fixed , as if it is not related to the behavior of K@@ arma .
However , it is hard to ground on a floor , and it is hard to adjust the ped@@ al field because it is not high in he@@ els .
This can lead to danger .
Although most cars have a flo@@ or car@@ pet@@ te , this material makes it easy to see , when the he@@ els suddenly brake , there is no ped@@ al .
There is also a case that the he@@ els became unable to return the ped@@ al after the ped@@ al .

Since September , the top tournament has been sought a positive result in a continuous fight .
A strong Taiwanese ace .
At@@ tention to Thai young people !
He also won the top tournament in Indonesia and Thailand ( S@@ 500 ) and won seven competitions .
In September , he also participated in the local Tai@@ bei ( S@@ 300 ) and won the event .
Originally a fi@@ jing@@ ical player who does not suffer from being strong .
There is no big problem with the performance of the game even after the tournament .
By winning high points in the first half of the game , it will be easier to adjust the upcoming competitions .
Until last year , it was an impression of explo@@ iting the explosion , but this year , it became possible to continue its performance .
For the world ranking number 1 , it seems to be more than ever before .
The results of the first battle other than the two players were in Thailand 's young A@@ so and India .
And he is the third player of An@@ ders An@@ der@@ as An@@ t@@ on@@ se@@ on , who is fighting alone as European forces .
Although there is no entry into the finals at the top tournament , it has the power to advance to the top , including entering the Best 4 in the 2 Games .
Although there are still some rough faces , the 20 years of age ( 21 years old ) , which became able to rally against top players , is likely to rise in the race .
Also , J@@ B has taken a step out of India in which players can be matched to singles .
The late thr@@ ic@@ am in Pr@@ onom@@ a , H.@@ S , and K@@ eg@@ a will also be noted in the future of S@@ li@@ k@@ ah Ki@@ had@@ am@@ bi , as well as in India .
New rates of mobile competition : fair electronic version
amendments The new fee plan for the mobile phone company associated with the enforcement of the Electronic Communication Business Act was established .
However , it was stopped .
" There are about 40 % lower space " in the last summer , and the price race was not high , even if the expectations were high .
It is a major factor in the three major states that a full-scale entry into the country .
For consumers , it is easy to use due to fair competition .
I would like to ask for the efforts of each cell .
The revision method prohi@@ bits the sec@@ rec@@ y of the terminal and the communication fee .
Instead of selling the terminal , the cost of communication became high .
Soft Bank and Play@@ bank ( X@@ uan ) announced a plan to maximize the terminal .
However , for the past 100 days , both companies can use the " Roc@@ ke@@ k " as their terminal .
N@@ ST@@ TE@@ D@@ omo makes up to 3 parts of the terminal generation for only its own line contracts .
3 companies will continue to " enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ation " in order to prevent them from going on .
For example , the Ministry of General Affairs provided a policy to require an instant cancellation .
Busin@@ esses also need to respond rapidly .
The post@@ pon@@ ement was because the construction of the communication network , such as the base station , did not proceed with the plan .
It was expected to become a competitive det@@ on@@ ator , but it was a good thing to do .
I wonder if there was a sweetness that I saw .
There is no time for the start of the service and the fee for full-scale services .
As a company to carry out social in@@ fr@@ a , I would like you to work with a charge .
The change of the fee was triggered by the remarks of Secretary Kan@@ so .
" I think that competition will begin in the next three new charges : I don 't think so much . "
However , " Kan@@ sei " does not think of the city as a whole and encouraging all competition .
The corporate side should expand the competition of Customer Hon@@ i before the government calls out .
Each company 's pricing system is very complex and is not easy to use .
The consumer agency called attention as there is a case that consumers out@@ weigh the value of consumers , such as " maximize value . "
Busin@@ esses themselves must be mind@@ ful of the easy explanation of their mis@@ understand@@ ings , so that they don 't make mistakes .

The heat fight took over the line .
It was 29 minutes later that I welcomed at 0 - 38 .
The enemy was deep in England , and the captain of England collapsed the bar@@ an@@ as when rec@@ alling the path .
That was the reason why I went to this .
However , he raised an upper body rather than from the waist , and b@@ ounded himself .
As a result , the head and head of the opponent are in contact and the shape of the head .
It was so severe that I over@@ threw it .

4-@@ hospital for restructuring , " standard dish "
Due to the growing medical detention system in an elderly age , we decided on exceptional measures as we needed to encourage restructuring and integration with hospitals in the conflict area .
We will also ask for a thorough review of re@@ structured and integrated hospitals to conclude next year .
Although there is no power , local chi@@ efs and local residents are prepared from an in@@ secure hospital .

The total number of targets was 5 4 in Hokkaido , and the Oki was only zero .
Based on the data of 2@@ 70 fiscal year , the Ministry of thick labor can meet the " Advanced Ac@@ cur@@ acy " for severe patients among public and public hospitals , and 5 hospitals in general .
He analy@@ sed the need for the hospital name to be published by the Nin@@ th Ne@@ uro@@ logy Hospital , such as cancer and medical treatment , and a competitive hospital .
You will be asked to consider de@@ prec@@ ation and some departments to other hospitals .
The cost of medical care increased by 2@@ 5 years , with the total number of members aged seven or more .
For this reason , the Ministry of work aims to reduce the number of beds in a hospital in Japan up to 9@@ 1,000 floors .
Currently , there are many beds of " advanced " and " acute " that cost medical care , and elderly people do not need high rehabilitation .
In order to cope with aging , the number of beds should not only be reduced alone , but also to increase rehabilitation .
For reorganization and integration of the hospital , each prefecture has established a " Regional Medicine " set up a number of beds required for 2 years .
It is divided into 3 categories , and is discussed by local governments and medical officials , but many local residents and chi@@ efs have maintained a modest stance .
The Ministry of thick work wants to connect to the activation of the discussion by publishing hospital names with no record .
For the first time in eight years ( videos ) , including the comprehensive training program , etc .

Po@@ si@@ tive vacc@@ ination Area 9 ( Gifu Shimbun newspaper ) - Yahoo !
In order to prevent the spread of the infection of her@@ al@@ iz@@ ome disease " pig " on February 7 , we can modify and vacc@@ ination against existing un@@ recognized pigs .
The target area consists of nine prefectures , including Gifu , Aichi Prefecture , which is confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild .
The movement of the vacc@@ inated living pigs and gr@@ asses is limited in the region , but the distribution of processed goods is allowed .
Through public comments to the general public ( opinion solic@@ itation ) , he aims to complete the work of G@@ ross .
By allowing the vaccine to be used , such as the distribution , it may not be a " clean country " recognized by international organizations and affect the export of pork meat .
Since last year , Japan was in a state where the status of a clean country was suspended .
In the revision , we set a " vacc@@ ination region " based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild to pig .
Each prefecture will create a " vacc@@ ination pro@@ gl@@ um " that summar@@ izes the range of vacc@@ ination , time , skull number , etc .
There are seven other prefectures as recommended areas of vacc@@ ination , Miy@@ ayama , Ishikawa , Fukui , Nagano , Mie and Shiga .
The region will review the situation and decide again when the guidelines are revised .
The movement of vacc@@ inated pigs , fertili@@ zers , bodies , and ex@@ od@@ or@@ ants is limited to the region .
For items processed and processed , they are not subject to the effects of Kod@@ st and farmers in the distribution restrictions , and in fact , they accept distribution of them .
We do not spread the u@@ il@@ es , so we will take care of food .
He also compl@@ ies with the safety of an im@@ mun@@ ized pig and also works on the prevention of the damage .
The revision of the guidelines was confirmed at the meeting of the Secretariat , which was held the same day .
In the future , we will implement opinions and public comments to the prefecture until July 7 , and implement new guidelines .

The " reverse offer " was sent and the world famous gates Manchester United .
Why did you make a great retreat to the Premier League Dec@@ ision Club ?
The reason is in the Australian article F@@ O@@ X sports , which was published on 24 .

B@@ oss shot shot by Mr. Be@@ ast on this day
The 1@@ W shot is not something that can be done with it .
There is also a technique called " Na@@ od@@ ora " in the ground when you want to earn a distance at the second level of the pur@@ 5 .
Although the recent 1@@ W is large in the he@@ ed body , the ball is accompanied by risk , but there are players who often rely on the ti@@ g@@ round .
The first victory of the tour has been waiting for us .
Professional 7 years old age is 16@@ 6 years old and small , but now ranked seventh in the driver 's division ( average 30@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 2 ) .
On the other hand , one of the challenges was the fin@@ alization of Fair@@ way@@ wood .
I thought that I would try to do Na@@ od@@ ora because the shot of S@@ pur@@ n ( 3@@ W ) was disabled in the spring .
From the practice round , you can drop the ball with pol@@ i on the grass of the rear , and 1 W can be found .
Big C@@ arri@@ e is required to use Na@@ od@@ as with narrow halls on both sides .
" It can be used in the halls where the front line is sl@@ ated . "
A record of 2@@ 70 to 2@@ 80 pieces in C@@ arri@@ e at the Dan@@ jo@@ do measuring instrument .
" That 's why 3@@ W does not bother you , so I can feel better than 3 W . "
From the " Japan Tour Championship " in June , only 1 W of wood in the cali@@ bre .
The second long club is U@@ T at 17 degrees lo@@ ft .
It is also aston@@ ished by the tour companions , and I am glad to hear the ex@@ clamation from the gallery .
Co@@ z said , " It is to change the club to level ( Mizu@@ hei ) . "
" Even if you hit the upper part of D@@ au@@ low@@ n , you will go to the right with a cut track , and originally it is a moderate arrow shot .
The ball will not be caught and accompanied by the ris@@ s risk , " So the left side will be removed ( not loud ) . "

After 4 , I left the par@@ 5 , so when I was going back , I came to Chi@@ p Eag@@ le on No. 6 .
7 Even though I was able to get a chance because I couldn 't do it in the latter half .
What did you get in the tournament now ?
Recently ( a shot ) It was nice that F@@ er W@@ ey was able to do it in a narrow course because the train was not good .
It was a course where the rough and the reverse eye was blowing at the bar and the distance changed , so I studied quite a lot ( I had no experience ) .
What is the difference between the usual tournament ?
( such as S@@ ama Ho ) It was possible to shoot cameras .
I didn 't care about it at all , but I used to make videos of the gallery .
I didn 't see much other than that , but because it is a competition where there are fewer Japanese players , I went to the game with the feeling that I would not lose to overseas athletes .
The second battle will continue , but I don 't want to win more than 1 wins , so I want to win another win , so I will take the Z@@ O@@ Z@@ O Championship to the top .

The drug of dementia that major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are struggling with research and development .
However , the relationship between dementia and living habits has been eluc@@ idated , and we have found that there is a possibility that it can be kept to the degree of memory .
I heard the story of Dr. Ke@@ isuke Nak@@ as@@ uke at the University Hospital .
There is no need for dementia .
- Prevention of dementia , while the treatment is waiting , what is the status qu@@ o ?
There is a difference in the differences between the appearance and severity , and everyone may be dementia when they grow older .
However , it is thought to take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs .
The drug used in Japan and some of the overseas countries have already become in@@ eligible for insurance , and we cannot expect the effective completion effect .
On the other hand , deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents decreased , while cancer death is also declining in anti@@ cancer therapy , people can live longer .
This is why the number of patients with dementia is increasing .
It is not only possible to solve by the people and families , but also to improve the environment that can be trusted in the community .
How to " forget about things "
There are people who are easy to become dementia , who are difficult to become ?
Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia , it may only reduce the symptoms and be " forgotten . "
The dementia is thought to be one of the habit@@ ual diseases and there is a tendency for people to become easy .
First , the authors tend to be prone to dementia .
dementia is one of the habit@@ ual diseases of life .
It is a combination of obesity , high blood pressure , ur@@ inary disease , and high chol@@ ec@@ ost blood .
The lack of economic power also influences .
Although there are regions in the United States where food tickets are distributed to the poor , food tickets can be stored in the food ticket and the frozen ham@@ burg or pi@@ an .
G@@ ass and electricity can not be used and people who live in an environment that cannot be cooked in the first place .
In su@@ gar@@ u , it becomes a diet with fewer vegetables and pork quality , and it becomes an ec@@ centric life of o@@ ily and sugar .
Although it is poor , it becomes ob@@ ese , but if you do it , you can see TV , but your body becomes in@@ dig@@ nant .
A similar situation can be in Japan .
Others , people who don 't think of things tend to become dementia .
In order to prevent dementia , it is necessary to think about things by reading books from day to day .
