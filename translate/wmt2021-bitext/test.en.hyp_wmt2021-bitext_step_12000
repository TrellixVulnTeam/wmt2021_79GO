Driving in a row is dangerous !
There are many mistakes in ped@@ al ped@@ als for young people ( A@@ uto M@@ esse Web ) - Yahoo !
Viol@@ ation of Road Traffic Act
It is a big mistake to think that the issue of the elderly driver is only a problem , although there are more reports of accidents due to mis@@ operation such as ped@@ als .
By the age of 10@@ 80 cases , with a large number of cases under the age of 24 , a result of more than 10@@ 3@@ 2 cases at 7@@ 5 years old .
It is important to note that there are many elderly people , but also young people .
Do you take a sh@@ out of the foot ?
Do you take safety ?
In this data , there are no records of the male ratio or cause , but unlike elderly people who are likely to decline in their bodies , such as driving skills and tri@@ fl@@ ation .
There are also people who choose a variety of shoes and drive as they are , such as female pu@@ ja , sand@@ als , and M@@ ule , and the dress of the day .
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving , but there is no doubt that it can lead to danger and many people are driving without any doubt .
However , driving in the streets and sand@@ als is a road traffic method .
The first one is to " manipulate the hand@@ les , brakes and other operations reliably , " and " Do not drive any harm to the person causing an accident . "
The other is the " violation of the safety committee , " which prevents the operation of the public safety committee , which the driver must comply with the requirements specified by the prefectural security committee .
Both prefectures and other prefectures do not have to memor@@ ize , but " It is possible to interfere with driving operations , " says Mis@@ awa .
Why is it dangerous for driving ?
It is Ming and white if you think about the basics of ped@@ aling safely .
For safe ped@@ al operation , first stick to the bottom of the foot and place the legs to be straight to the brake ped@@ al , and when stepping on the accelerator ped@@ al , turn right to the foot .
At this point , it is important to keep it firmly and firmly as if it is not enough for the cl@@ um@@ ps .
However , because the area is small and difficult to ground on the thin floor , the area is grounded in the ped@@ al , because it is small and small and small , with a height of he@@ els .
This could lead to danger .
In addition , most cars are covered with a Flo@@ a Cur@@ pet@@ te , but in this material , the ped@@ al is easy to des@@ c@@ end , and when a sudden brake , the he@@ el is standing in between .
In addition , some cases suggest that the he@@ el is back on the back side of the ped@@ al and the accelerator ped@@ al is no longer returned .

The Japanese representative who won six m@@ end@@ ars at the 2@@ 5th World Championships at the Big Event of B@@ admin@@ ton held in August ( S@@ ly@@ the B@@ admin@@ ton ) , has just completed the opening ceremony in early September .
From May to August , when the Olympic Games of the Tokyo Olympics started next year , the men 's singles will be re@@ printed for G@@ az@@ uki ( September - December ) while looking back on the first half of the game .
Starting from May , the B@@ admin@@ ton Olympics race has been de@@ prec@@ ated by top players ( more than 500 ) at the end of World Championships .
In the first half of the tournament , the two of them won the fourth tournament , and the other two of them were H@@ aj@@ im@@ un and Ch@@ un Ch@@ un .
He won the World Championships , Az@@ usa Indonesia ( S@@ 1000 ) and the World Ran@@ king Point , which is directly connected to the Olympic Games .
In addition to that , Japan ( S@@ 7@@ 50 ) is also being used .
The tournament that has entered since May is the S@@ di@@ er@@ man Cup ( May / China ) , Indonesia ( July / Results 16 ) , Japan ( July ) and the World Championships ( August ) .
Although the number is small compared to other top players , it is scheduled to reduce the burden on the body .
August was only one tournament of the World Championships , but it would not be much more exhausted than J@@ ing .
A good outcome is required for the final tournament since September .
A@@ ce of strong Taiwan .
At@@ tention to the young Thai !
He also won the top tournament of Indonesia and Ay@@ umi ( S@@ 500 ) , where he played seven games in the tournament .
In September , he participated in the local Ta@@ iga ( S@@ 300 ) and won the tournament .
Originally , he was a player who did not suffer a lot of trouble .
Even after the tournament , there is no big problem with the performance of the game .
By gaining a high point in the first half , it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament .
Until last year , it was an impression that it was impossible to explo@@ de until last year , but the stability of the play has increased this year , making it possible to continue firmly .
The first place in the world ranking seems to be more than ever .
In addition to these two players , the result was left in the first half of the race in Thailand 's young A@@ ce and India .
And he is the third player of An@@ dal@@ is Anton@@ sen , who is fighting for an army as a European team .
Although he did not enter the final at the top of the tournament , he won the highest level , such as entering the best 4 in the tournament .
Although there is still a rough aspect , 20 years old ( 18 , 21 years old ) , who came to be able to rally against top players , seems to have the potential to leap into the Olympic race .
In addition , he took a step in India , where he had a good player in singles .
In the future , there is no need to be careful in India , as well as in the coming days , the Phar@@ is@@ ee H@@ .@@ S. , and K@@ eg@@ a 's late K@@ eg@@ a .
The new price of the cell is fair competition .
The new fee plan of the mobile phone company following the enforcement of the T@@ elecommunications Business Act .
However , it was stopped .
Is@@ ao Kan said that " there was about 40 % lower margin " last summer , and the price competition did not occur , even if the expectations of the land were high .
It is a major factor in the situation that three major companies have continued to pro@@ claim .
For consumers , it is easy to use because of fair competition .
I would like to ask for the efforts of each company .
The amended law prohi@@ bits the set@@ -up of the terminal and the communication fee .
This is because the communication fee was set to be more expensive than selling the terminal .
Soft Bank and Play@@ er@@ board Co . , Ltd. announced a plan to make up the terminal .
However , both companies do not have access to other company lines for 100 days .
N@@ U@@ TED TE@@ D@@ CO@@ MO will make up to three parts of the device 's bill for subscribers of its own line .
The three companies show that they continue to " enc@@ lose " to prevent the exchange of the exchange for other companies .
Regarding the lock , the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications provided a policy to require immediate termination .
The corporate side needs to respond quickly .
The reason for this is because the maintenance of communication networks such as the base station did not proceed as planned .
Just as it was expected to become a cr@@ ater for competition , it was a good idea .
I wonder if there was a sweet taste .
The start date and fees of the full service are not obvious .
As a company that handles social in@@ fr@@ a , I would like you to work on your business with blame .
The change of the fee was triggered by the statement of Mr. Kan .
" I think the competition will start from now on , and I don 't think that it is good . "
However , " K@@ any@@ aku " does not think that it will push the city to compete healthy .
The business side should be competitive in the customer 's position before they are spoken by the government .
The rate structure of each company is very complex , and it is not easy to compare .
As the terminal is advertising such as " maxim@@ izing " , the Consumer Office called attention as there are cases where the burden of consumers out@@ weigh .
You must be aware of the easy explanation that is easy to grasp , in order not to make mistakes of the user .

The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare announced the first 4@@ 5-@@ 4 hospitals , determined to be " poor medical results , " among public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan .
In Fukui Prefecture , the department of thick labor department exam@@ ines the results of treatment of 1 4 public hospitals , public hospitals , and 1 4 facilities in the Kok@@ uro Hospital , which is located in the Wak@@ as@@ a-@@ Japan Hospital .
[ 4 ] The " standard side " of the hospital for the restructuring .
Due to the aging and bur@@ sting medical expenses , we needed to encourage the restructuring and integration of hospitals in the area of conflict , and we took on an unusual response .
In addition , we will request a full-scale review of restructuring and integration to the target hospital , and we will make a conclusion by next year .
There is no strong power , but it is fore@@ seen from local em@@ irates and residents due to the lack of close hospital .
It was announced at the same meeting .
The target hospital was hit by 2@@ 9,@@ 1 % of the total , and there were many hospitals with fewer beds .
By prefecture , Niigata ( 5@@ 3-@@ 7 % ) , Hokkaido ( 4@@ 8-@@ 6 % ) , Miy@@ ash@@ iro ( 4@@ 7,@@ 5 % ) , San@@ guchi ( 4@@ 6-@@ 7 % ) and Okayama ( 4 % ) .
The number of targets was the highest in the five four regions in Hokkaido , and the Oki was the only zero .
Based on the data of the fiscal year 20@@ 1 , the Ministry of thick labor can investigate " high acute term " for serious patients and " acute term " for general medical treatment .
We analyzed the results of the 9-@@ degree medical treatment , such as cancer and sudden medical care , and whether the conflic@@ ting hospital is " within 20 minutes by car , " and determined the need for the public .
The target hospital will consider for@@ ging and transferring some medical courses to other hospitals .
Medical costs will increase in the next five years , where all members of the group will be over 7@@ 5-@@ years old .
As a result , the Ministry of thick labor plans to reduce the number of beds in a hospital with a total of 24@@ 6,000 floors ( 1 year ) to 1,@@ 9@@ 1,000 floors .
Currently , there are many " Advanced acute " and " acute phase " beds , which require medical expenses , while high rehabilitation needs for elderly people .
In order to respond to aging , it is necessary to not only reduce the number of beds by one , but also increase rehabilitation .
Through the restructuring and integration of the hospital , each prefecture has formulated a " regional medical treatment system " which sets the number of beds required for two and five years .
It is divided into three nine separate regions throughout the country , and is consul@@ ted by local governments and medical professionals , but many local residents and em@@ ail@@ ments maintain a strong attitude and are difficult to discuss .
The Ministry of thick labor wants to connect to the activation of the discussion by publishing the name of a hospital with poor performance .

9 districts recommended pig vaccine ( Gifu Shimbun ) - Yahoo !
On February 7 , the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has announced an amendment to the anti-@@ vacc@@ ination guidelines that are not currently recognized to the her@@ ald pig to prevent the spread of " pig " disease .
The target area is set to choose nine provinces , such as Gifu and Aichi Prefecture , where the infection of pig and wild fish is confirmed .
The movement of the vacc@@ inated living pig and az@@ uke is limited to the region , but the distribution of processed goods is accepted .
Through public comments such as public comments to the general public , we aim to complete it quickly .
By using a vaccine and acknowled@@ ging its distribution , it is possible that it will not be a " pur@@ ified country " which was certified by international organizations , but also affect the export of pork meat .
Since the outbreak of this year , Japan was temporarily in the state of a country of clean@@ liness .
In the revised proposal , based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild to pig , the recommended area for vacc@@ ination is set .
The target prefectures produce a " vacc@@ ination pro@@ agram " that summar@@ izes the scope and time of vacc@@ ination , numbers , and methods , and can be used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
The other seven provinces that have been raised as a recommended local plan are Sai@@ j@@ ama , Toyama , Ishikawa , Fukui , Nagano , and Shiga .
The area is determined again when the guidelines are amended .
The movement , such as vacc@@ inated pigs and fertili@@ zers , bodies , and vul@@ tures , is limited to the region as the original rule .
As for raw materials , they are not subject to the influence of co@@ sts and farmers , which are limited to distribution restrictions , and they are deemed to be in fact distributed to the market .
Because it does not spread the u@@ il@@ us , we will continue to process food .
He appealed for the safety of imported pigs , and he also tried to prevent rumors .
The revision of the guidelines was confirmed at the meeting of the As@@ sign@@ ment Committee held on the same day .
In the future , opinions and public comments to the prefecture will be carried out until the 7th day , and new guidelines will be implemented .

The other person who sent the " reverse offer " is Man@@ uel United , who is a world-@@ famous .

Be@@ ast shot on the day
The 1@@ W shot is not one by all .
There is also a technique called " Na@@ od@@ ora " that kno@@ cks a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance by a second hit of par@@ 5 .
The recent 1@@ W is due to its heavy weight , which is associated with the risk of the ball , but there are players who often turn on the Tig@@ ers .
The first victory of the tour was waiting .
At the age of 24 , the professional seventh year , he was about 16@@ 6 , and now 7th place in the dry di@@ st@@ ence division ( average 30@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 2 ) .
On the other hand , one of the challenges was the quality of Fair@@ w@@ ad@@ wood .
In the spring , " The shot of S@@ pu@@ n ( 3@@ W ) was not good , so I would like to try straight d@@ harma . "
From the practice round to the top of the ma@@ ple grass , the ball is pe@@ aked with the po@@ th@@ ol@@ i and one W is thrown away .
In the case where the Big C@@ arri@@ e is required , it is used to make use of straight d@@ harma at a narrow hall .
" It can be used in the hall where the eye line is fl@@ ushed down . "
The record of 2@@ 70 ~ 2@@ 80 was recorded by Car@@ ry .
" So there is no 3@@ W , so you can feel more secure than 3 W .
From the " Japan Tour Championship " in June , only one W of wood is in the ca@@ dia .
The second longest club is the U@@ T at L@@ of@@ t 17 .
I am very excited about the war method that is also surprised by the tour companions , and I am very excited to hear that is leaked from the gallery .
" To make the club a level . "
" Even if you are hit on the upper side , you must go to the right with the cut gauge road , and you can take a 1 W shot straight to the right .
The ball is not caught and accompanied by the risk of S@@ ly@@ is , " So the left side is er@@ ratic . "
It is a professional skill that makes you feel un@@ think@@ able .
