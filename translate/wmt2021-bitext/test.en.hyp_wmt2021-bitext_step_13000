However , the area is small enough to ground on the floor , and the area of the ped@@ als is small enough to adjust the height of the he@@ el .
This is thought to lead to danger .

A big b@@ admin@@ ton event held in August , a Japanese representative who won six Med@@ als at the 2@@ 5th World Championship ( S@@ ly@@ the Bur@@ z@@ el ) , an early September 10@@ 00@@ - and an early September 10 - 17 .
Here , we look back at the first half of the Olympic race from May to August , when the next year 's Tokyo Olympic Games were launched , and we want to introduce men 's singles ( September - December ) .
The B@@ admin@@ ton Olympic Race , which started in May , turned out to be the top player ( 500 or more ) four competitions at the end of World Championship .
In the first half of the game , they won two wins during the four Games and two of them were Ken@@ to , and Taiwan 's Taiwan 's Sh@@ ou Ch@@ ung .
He won the world champion@@ ships , the R@@ ank@@ ings of Indonesia ( S@@ 1000 ) and the World Ran@@ king Points directly connected to the Olympic Race .
In addition to that , Japan ( S@@ 7@@ 50 ) is also holding .
The tournament , which has been participating in since May , is the S@@ di@@ er@@ man Cup ( May / China ) , Indonesia ( July 16 ) , Japan ( July ) and the World Championship ( August ) .
Although there are fewer numbers compared to other top players , it is scheduled to reduce the burden on the pu@@ n .
August was the only one tournament in the world championship , and it would not be much ti@@ ring .
A positive outcome is required for the upcoming tournament after September .
The strong Taiwanese ace .
Also , attention to young Thai people !
He also won the top tournament of Indonesia and Indonesia ( S@@ 500 ) .
In September , he took part in the head of the local tro@@ l@@ ley ( S@@ 300 ) and won the prize .
Originally Fi@@ j@@ ical is strong , and he is not suffering .
There is no big problem with the performance of the game .
By earning high points in the first half , it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming competition .
Until last year , it was an impression that it was an explosion force , but this year , the stability of the play surface increased .
For the first place in the world rankings , it seems to be a more generous partner .
In addition to these two players , the results were left in the first half .
And the three players of An@@ der@@ us An@@ t@@ ann@@ se@@ en , who are fighting alone as a European force .
Although he has not entered the finals at the top of the competition , he has the power to win the top 4 .
Although there is still a rough one , 20 years old ( 18 , 21 years old ) , who became able to rally against top players , have a great potential to leap in the Olympic race .
In addition , he took a step in India where he had a good player in singles .
The S@@ ri@@ k@@ ans K@@ id@@ am@@ bi , which is going to be late in K@@ eg@@ a , Pr@@ an@@ oid H@@ .S@@ . and K@@ eg@@ a , is just going to come forward .
New rates of mobile phones Fair competition :
Rev@@ ision of the Electric Communication Business Act The new fee plan for the mobile phone company .
But it stopped .
Ke@@ i S@@ uga said that last summer " there is an after@@ ground that can fall below 40 % , " and even though he had high expectations for him , there was no price competition .
It is a great reason for the full-scale entry of the group and the three major ol@@ ig@@ ans .
For consumers , it is easy to use because of fair competition .
I want to make efforts for mobile companies .
The revised Act prohi@@ bits the Set@@ to Ex@@ pen@@ dit@@ ure for terminal and communication fees .
Instead of selling the terminal bill , the communication fee was set to be expensive .
Soft banks and play cards have announced plans to maximize the number of devices .
However , both companies will not be able to use other company lines for 100 days .
N@@ UT@@ TED TE@@ D@@ CO@@ MO will make up to three parts of the terminal fee for subscribers of its own line .
The three companies seem to continue " enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ating " to prevent them from switching to other companies .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications decided to un@@ do it immediately .
Companies need to respond quickly .
This was due to the lack of communication networks as planned .
It was hoped that it would be an explosion of competition .
I wonder if there was a sweetness .
There has been no indication of the start and pricing of full-scale services .
As a company that carries social in@@ fr@@ a , I want you to work with blame .
This change was triggered by Mr. Kan .
Mr. S@@ uga expressed his dis@@ satisfaction that the competition will start in the future , and he does not fully believe that it is good .
However , " I can 't imagine that the government will make the city and encourage a healthy competition .
The corporate side should be competitive with the customer before the government comm@@ its .
The rate system of each company is very complex and the value is not easy .
The Consumer Agency called attention as there is a case where consumer burden sur@@ passes , as the terminal has issued ads such as " maxim@@ ization . "
We must be aware of the easy-to-@@ understand explanations of the company to avoid users ' mis@@ understand@@ ings .

Due to an aging system of medical costs , the hospital needs to be re@@ structured and integrated with hospitals in a competitive area .
He also called on the target hospital for a full-scale examination of reorganization and integration , and thought to him next year .
There is no strong force , but the local em@@ ir@@ res@@ sions of local may@@ ors and residents are fore@@ seen from the absence of clo@@ sen@@ ess .

The number of targets was the highest in Hokkaido , and only zero .
Based on the data of the fiscal year 20@@ 7 , the Ministry of Health and Welfare will be able to respond to " acute period " and " acute period " for severe patients .
We analyzed the medical performance of the 9@@ 9th degree , including cancer and emergency relief , and whether the conflic@@ ting hospital would be within 20 minutes by car , and judged the need for hospital name release .
In the targeted hospital , you will be asked to consider for@@ ging and transferring some departments to other hospitals .
Medical costs have sur@@ ged in the past five years , which is more than seven five years old .
For this reason , the Ministry of Finance has set a goal of reducing the number of beds of hospitals with a total of 24@@ 6,000 beds of 1@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 1,000 beds .
Currently , the number of beds for " high acute period " and " acute period " which require medical costs is high , while the number of elderly people is in@@ significant .
In order to respond to aging , the number of beds must be reduced individually , but also to increase rehabilitation .
In order to re@@ organize and integrate hospitals , each prefecture has established the number of beds required for the next five years .
Although the country is divided into three nine areas , local governments and medical personnel are discussing , many local residents and em@@ bas@@ sies have maintained a de@@ prec@@ ated attitude .

As far as last season , I left Melbourne in the Australia A. League , and I was surprised to see the current Japanese representative , Ke@@ isuke U@@ n .
[ Video ] Ke@@ isuke , was you in a game ?
The true fruit of the heavens .
Japan Time 27 At midnight , he updated his own Twitter , saying , " Don 't need any money , but you need a great team and a great team to play . "
The partner who sent the " reverse offer " was Manchester United , a world-@@ famous gate .
Why did the Premier League bend club have a great re@@ mission ?
It was an article about the Australian version " F@@ O@@ X Sport " released on the 24th .
In an article entitled " Five For@@ war@@ ds of five who have been injured by Manchester United " in the midst of the crisis , five players are now able to win .
There were also names of players such as H@@ ati@@ m Ben Alph@@ a , Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe Ros@@ si , W@@ ill@@ fel@@ d Bon@@ nie .
Currently , United is in an emergency situation , including MF Po@@ or P@@ og@@ ba , D@@ f Er@@ ick By@@ l@@ ley , F@@ W An@@ t@@ ney Mar@@ sh@@ al and F@@ W Mar@@ cus Rus@@ h F@@ W .

Therefore , the name of the local media was named as a new candidate for the@@ or@@ izing .
In the article , " If strictly speaking , it is not a stri@@ ker , but as a creative side player , the co@@ venant can fill the hole filled with An@@ d@@ le@@ as@@ o Pet@@ ra . "
The score of 18 matches in Melbourne 's 18 matches is " a serious record , " but " 3@@ 3-@@ year-old " is a representative of Cambodia who needs to be away from his pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by .

From the practice round , the ball falls on the grass of the rear , and the 1@@ W is sprink@@ led .

" It can be used in the hall where the line is beating down . "
With a measuring instrument , the record is 2@@ 70 ~ 2@@ 80 .
" So there is no 3@@ W , " he said .

It is also a pleasure to hear the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ation from the gallery .

The ball is not caught and accompanied by the risk of the sl@@ is , " So the left side is de@@ activated .
It is an unexpected professional skill to say to Cant@@ on .
