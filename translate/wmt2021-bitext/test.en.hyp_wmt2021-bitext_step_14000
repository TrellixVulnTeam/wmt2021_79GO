Driving in a row is dangerous !
There are many accidents that are wrong with the ped@@ aling of young people . - Yahoo ! News
Viol@@ ation of road traffic law
The number of reports of accidents due to mis@@ manipulation such as ped@@ als is increasing , but it is a big mistake to think that this is only a problem for elderly drivers .
The number of mistakes caused by ped@@ aling by age ( 201@@ 5.@@ National Police Agency data ) exceeded 10@@ 3@@ 2 cases of 7@@ 5-@@ year-old age , with a high age of 24 or less .
It is important to call attention to young people as well , not many people who are determined .
Take a foot@@ bath ?
Take safety ?
There is no sign of the male ratio or cause of this data , but there is often a decline in the body such as driving skill or an@@ orth@@ o .
Some women choose various shoes and drive them as they are , depending on their clothes and clothes on the day .
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving , but others do not think at all about the possibility that it will lead to danger .
However , driving in brass and sand@@ als is a road transportation method .
The first is to ensure the operation of the hand@@ held , brake , and other operations , and " Do not make sure to drive the person in danger of the accident " Article 70@@ . "
And the other is that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public security committee ( Article 71 ) , which is prohibited from compliance with the public security committee .
It is the same for each prefecture to violate the possibility of driving in a " mo@@ vable " that may interfere with the operation .
Why is it dangerous to drive with f@@ laws ?
It is clear if you come up with the basics of ped@@ aling safely .
For safe and secure ped@@ al operations , first place the legs on the floor and set the feet to be flat against the brake ped@@ al , and step on the accelerator ped@@ al to the right end .
At this time , it is important to ensure that the k@@ arma does not cover the movements of the Kur@@ uma and ensure that it is properly fixed .
However , it is small enough to ground on the floor , and the area is small enough to ground on the floor , so that the feet are slightly adjusted with high he@@ els and the whole feet are firmly adjusted .
This could lead to danger .
In addition , most cars have a flo@@ or ke@@ pe@@ et , but this material makes it easier to get rid of the bru@@ ises , and when the he@@ el is not attached to the ped@@ al when there is no pressure .
In addition , there is a case that the he@@ els were removed from the ped@@ al and the accelerator ped@@ al was lost .

It was this time that we decided to continue our business .
De@@ b@@ t is currently under investigation , but it is estimated to be about two billion yen .

The Japanese representative who won six mel@@ end@@ ars at the 2@@ 5th World Championships ( S@@ ace B@@ az@@ el ) held in August in B@@ admin@@ ton ( B@@ ly@@ the B@@ az@@ el ) ( S@@ ace B@@ az@@ el ) : The first day of the month of the year in September : The first year of the month of the month of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the year of the month of the year ( August ) :
Here , we will look back on the first half of the race from May to August , when the Tokyo Olympics race took place next year , and look for men 's singles ( from September to December ) .
Starting in May , the B@@ admin@@ ton Olympics race turned out to be the top tournament ( more than 500 ) when the world championship ended .
In the first half of the race , two of them would have won the championship and two of them were Ken@@ to , and two of them in Taiwan .
He won the championship with a high point of " World Ran@@ king Point " which is directly connected to the Olympics race with Indonesia ( S@@ 1000 ) .
Besides that , Japan ( S@@ 7@@ 50 ) is also in charge .
The competition from May is the S@@ di@@ er@@ man Cup ( May / China ) , Indonesia ( July / 16 ) , Japan ( July ) and the World Championships ( August ) .
Although the number of other top players is small , it is scheduled to reduce the burden on them .
August was the only tournament of the World Championships , but it would be more ti@@ ring than usual .
Good results are required in continuous competition after September .
A strong Taiwan ace .
At@@ tention to young Thai people !
He won the championship in the top tournament of Indonesia Expo and Thailand ( S@@ 500 ) .
In September , he participated in the local Ta@@ isho@@ ji ( S@@ 300 ) and won the championship .
Originally , a player who has a strong f@@ j@@ k@@ ar and does not bother .
Even after the tournament , there is no big problem with the performance of the match .
By gaining high points in the first half of the race , it would be easier to adjust the schedule of upcoming competitions .
Until last year , it was an impression that the explosion force was indispensable , but as a result of increased stability in the playing field , it became possible to continue with good grades .
For the first place in the world rankings , it seems to be a more serious opponent .
In addition to these two players , the results were left in the first half .
And he is the third player of An@@ der@@ us An@@ t@@ ec@@ en , who is fighting for a sol@@ itary force .
Although there is no final entry at the top tournament , he has the power to win the top level , including entering the best four in the 2nd tournament .
Even though there is still a br@@ ack@@ ish aspect , twenty years of age ( 18 , 21 years old ) , who have become able to rally against top players , are likely to leap forward in the race .
In addition , he took a step in India where he had good players for singles .
It is necessary to pay attention to the future of India after the race , as well as to the late sl@@ ick c@@ ud@@ am@@ bi in the K@@ eg@@ a .
Cell new charges for fair competition .
Rev@@ isions to the new price plan for mobile phone companies in the implementation of the telecommunications business .
But it stopped .
S@@ uga Wei said that last summer " there is a place to go down about 40 % , " and even though the expectations of K@@ aho were high , price competition did not happen .
It is a major reason that the full-scale participation of the group has been postponed and the ol@@ ig@@ archy of three major companies continues .
For consumers , fair competition makes it easy to use the pricing system .
We want to seek the efforts of mobile companies .
The revised Act prohi@@ bits the allocation of terminals and telecommunications charges .
Instead of selling the terminals , the communication fee became expensive .
The soft bank and the Play@@ ground Card announced plans to maximize the device .
However , the two companies have a system that can 't use the other companies ' lines for a hundred days .
The company will make up to three units of the terminal fee for only subscribers of its own lines .
The three companies seem to continue to hold a " enclosure " that prevents them from going on .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced a policy to require a prompt termination .
Companies need to respond quickly .
The delay was due to the lack of communication networks as planned .
Just as it was expected to be a pro@@ tr@@ usion of competition , it is a good thing that made a shoulder .
Perhaps there was a sweetness of sight .
The timing and fees of full-scale services are not clear .
As a company to carry social in@@ fr@@ a , we want you to work with blame .
The re@@ valuation of the fee was triggered by a statement by Secretary Kan .
S@@ uga said , " I think the competition will begin in the future , and I do not think it is good to do this . "
However , it is not surprising that the government will leave the city and encourage a healthy competition .
Companies should compete with customers before they are spoken from the government .
The rate system of each company is very complex and the relative is not easy .
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention as there are cases where the consumer 's burden out@@ weigh the consumer , while the terminals are selling advertisements such as " maximize . "
Companies themselves must be aware of a respec@@ tful and though@@ tful explanation to avoid mis@@ interpretation of users .

MH@@ L@@ W announced the 4@@ 2.4 hospital name for the first time in Japan on July 6 , when 4@@ 5 public hospitals and public hospitals in Japan were judged to have poor medical results .
In Fukui Prefecture , the Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare will examine the treatment achievements of 1@@ 4 public hospitals in Fukui Prefecture , and the Kun@@ it@@ ai Hospital of K@@ uni Hospital in K@@ uni City of K@@ uni .
4 hospital for restructuring " Standard friendly "
Because of an aging medical care system , it is necessary to promote restructuring and integration with hospitals in the conflict area , and the treatment was extraordinary .
In addition , we ask the target hospital for a full-scale review of reorganization and integration , and we will make a conclusion next year .
Although there is no force , the local chi@@ efs and residents are expected to be dis@@ cour@@ aged from the lack of clo@@ sen@@ ess .
It was announced at the same time .
The target hospital was 2@@ 9.@@ 1 % of the total number of hospitals with fewer beds .
In each prefecture , Niigata ( 5@@ 3-@@ 7 % ) , Hokkaido ( 4@@ 8-@@ 6 % ) , Miyagi Castle ( 4@@ 7-@@ 5 % ) , and Yam@@ aguchi ( 4@@ 6-@@ 7 % ) , and Okayama Prefecture ( 4 / 3 % ) .
The number of targets was 5@@ 4 in Hokkaido , and only zero in Okinawa .
Based on the data of the 20 / 7 fiscal year , the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare will be able to investigate the " acute " for severe patients in public and public hospitals , as well as the " acute phase " for general procedures .
The hospital identified the need for the hospital name to be announced by analyzing the experience of nine medical treatments such as cancer and emergency medical care , and whether the conflic@@ ting hospital would be within 20 minutes ' place .
In the targeted hospital , some medical care departments should be taken into consideration .
Medical costs will increase in the second five years in which all members of the group generation are seven or older .
For this reason , the ministry will aim to reduce the number of hospital beds of 2,@@ 4@@ 6,@@ 6 thousand beds ( 1 year ) across the country to 1,@@ 9@@ 0,000 floors .
Currently , there are many beds for " high acute " and " acute " that require medical care costs , and elderly people are not satisfied with the need for rehabilitation .
In order to respond to the aging population , it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds .
In order to re@@ organize and integrate hospitals , we have developed a " regional medical facility " that each prefecture has set up the number of beds necessary for the next five years .
Many local residents and chi@@ efs have maintained a modest attitude , and the discussion is difficult .
The ministry wants to revit@@ alize the discussion by publishing a hospital name with poor performance .

Pi@@ g vaccine recommended areas 9 pref@@ abr@@ icated Gifu Prefecture - Yahoo ! News
On February 7 , the Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry and Agriculture announced that it will be possible to change the vacc@@ ination policy to the current in@@ discrimin@@ ate pigs to prevent the spread of infection of the her@@ al@@ cul@@ ation disease .
The target area will be selected for nine prefectures , including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture , which have confirmed infection in pigs and wild .
The movement of imported living pigs and pigs is restricted in the region , but the distribution of processed goods is accepted .
Through public comments ( public opinion ) to the general public , we aim to complete the final stages of the event .
By recognizing the use of vaccines and the distribution of meat , it is possible that the international organizations will not become a " pur@@ ified nation " and affect the export of pork meat .
Since the outbreak of last year , Japan has been holding a temporary state of purity .
In the revised proposal , the recommended vacc@@ ination area is set based on expert opinions regarding areas with high risk of infection from wild to pigs .
The target prefectures produce the vacc@@ ination pro@@ gr@@ am , which summar@@ izes the range , timing , number of cases , etc . , and receive the confirmation of the ministry and allow the use by the decision .
Other seven prefectures , which are recommended for vacc@@ ination , are Sa@@ is@@ ama , Toyama , Ishikawa , Fukui , Nagano , and Shiga .
Once the guidelines are revised , the region will review the situation and decide again .
The movement of imported pigs , su@@ ic@@ ides , dead bodies , and ov@@ ulation is restricted to the region as a rule .
Regarding processed products and processed products , it is not intended to be based on the impact of farmers and farmers on distribution restrictions , and in fact fav@@ ors the distribution .
In order to avoid spreading the u@@ iles , we will continue to process the texture of food .
He also appeals to the safety of the imported pigs and works to prevent harmful rumors .
The amendment of the Guid@@ eline was confirmed at the meeting of the A@@ mus@@ ement Committee on the same day .

Japanese version shot
1@@ W shot is not always a must .
There is also a technique called " Na@@ od@@ ora " when you want to earn money with the second stroke of par@@ 5 .
The recent 1@@ W has a large volume of he@@ ed , and ball is accompanied by risk , but there are many players who practice this on the Tig@@ ers Round .
The first victory of the tour was awaited .
At the age of 24 in the seventh year of the professional , he was about 16@@ 6 years old , but now ranked 7th in the driving division ( average 30@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 2 ) .
On the other hand , one of the challenges was the commitment of Fair@@ way@@ wood .
In the early spring , " I thought I would like to do a direct d@@ ora " because the shot of S@@ pu@@ n ( 3@@ W ) was useless .
There are times when the ball falls on the grass of the rear from the practice round , and it is possible to make a 1@@ W break .
In the case where big carry is required , it is used for pr@@ ag@@ matic purposes , but the two sides use the direct d@@ ora in narrow halls .
" It can be used in a hall where the line is beating down . "
A record of 2,@@ 7@@ 0-@@ 2@@ 80 in a car@@ y-@@ carrying instrument .
That 's why 3@@ W doesn 't go on ; it 's much easier to see more direct d@@ ora than 3@@ W .
From the June Japan Tour Championship , wood is only 1@@ W in the ca@@ di@@ bu@@ g .
The second longest club is the U@@ T of Ro@@ ft 17 degrees .
I am happy to hear the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating voice from the gallery that I saw .

You can 't fly to the right if you are on the cutting road , even if you hit the upper part , or in the upper part , or in the middle of the shooting club .
The ball is not caught , and accompanied by the risk of S@@ ly@@ is , " So the left side disappears ( not to the left ) "
It is a professional technique that is un@@ think@@ able .

K@@ ind@@ ai University Hospital I have heard a lecture about the B@@ rain Grad@@ uation Center Shun@@ suke .
dementia does not disappear
Pre@@ vent@@ ing dementia and taking care of the treatment are waiting , but what is the current situation ?
The difference in degrees , from pr@@ e to severity , can be dementia when everyone ages .
However , it is still believed that it will take more than twenty years to develop new dementia drugs .
Some countries in Japan have already been in@@ su@@ itably in@@ sured and cannot expect the effects of the book .
On the other hand , people have been able to live longer , as infectious diseases and accidents have reduced their deaths and cancer deaths have declined due to the gradual progress in treating anti-@@ cancer drugs .
Therefore , it is true that dementia patients are increasing .
It is not only possible to solve by people and families , but it is necessary to establish a safe and secure environment throughout society .
How to " forget things "
Are there people who are prone to dementia ?

People who are living in an environment where they cannot use gas or electricity and cannot cook .
S@@ lightly , it becomes a diet with little vegetables and bon@@ ito quality , and it becomes a life of gre@@ asy and sugar .
It is poor , but ob@@ ese , and if you do it , you just have to look at TV .
There is a similar situation in Japan .
Other people who do not think of things or work tend to become dementia .
In order to prevent dementia , you need to read books and think things on a daily basis .
