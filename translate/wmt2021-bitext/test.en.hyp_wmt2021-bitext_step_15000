Driving in the ca@@ vities is dangerous !
There are many accidents that are wrong with ped@@ al ped@@ als of young people ( A@@ to M@@ esse Web ) - Yahoo !
Viol@@ ence of road traffic law
It is a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for older drivers , though the number of reported accidents caused by mis@@ manipulation such as ped@@ al ped@@ als is increasing .
In the case of an accident by age , the number of cases reported by the Japan Metropolitan Police Agency ( 2015 ) is 10@@ 80 , which is under 24 years old , and the result is more than 10@@ 3@@ 2 cases over 7@@ 5 .
It is important to note that there are not many mistakes in the elderly , and it is important for young people to be careful .
Do you take a sh@@ out ?
Is it safe ?
Although there is no record of the male ratio or cause of this data , there is often a decline in the body such as driving skills and the an@@ orth@@ op@@ e@@ dic Sutra , and the cause of in@@ adver@@ tently ir@@ reversible wear and other stories in the young people .
On the other hand , some women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day , such as p@@ ou@@ s , sand@@ als , m@@ ule and others drive as they are .
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving , but some people do not think of the possibility that it will lead to danger , and there are many people driving without evil .
However , driving with sand@@ als and sand@@ als is a road traffic method .
The first is to ensure the operation of hand@@ held , brake , and other operations , " and " Do not drive in such a way that causes an accident or harm to a person . "
Another is that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by each prefectural public security committee , and the operation of the vehicle is prohibited in Article 71 , which is a violation of the safety security committee .
In each prefecture , it is the same as a violation of the operation of the operation with the potential to hin@@ der the operation of the operation .
The reason why is it dangerous to drive the car ?
If you think about the basics of ped@@ al operation safely , it is clear white .
For safe and secure ped@@ al operation , first fix the ped@@ al on the floor , put the feet on the ped@@ al , and when you step on the accelerator ped@@ al , the right foot is the starting point .
At this time , it is important to firmly fix it as if it is not related to the movement of the wal@@ nut .
However , the area where the flat ground is difficult to ground on the floor is small , and it is necessary to adjust the gu@@ la@@ gr@@ a at any time , and the height of the he@@ el makes the whole foot slightly smaller and ground on the ped@@ al .
This is believed to lead to danger .
In addition , most cars have a flo@@ or car@@ pet@@ te , but this material is easy to wear and the he@@ el is attached to this material , and it is difficult to put the he@@ el in the back of the car .
In addition , there are cases in which the he@@ el was unable to return the ped@@ al to the rear of the ped@@ al .

I want to support young people who can work hard in the recruitment
How does it work ? - In the first place , what kind of mechanism does it have ?
Kobayashi : Now , the profession of this work has become a dream of many young people .
Elementary school students are in the top of the job rankings they want to pursue in the future , and the number of young people who are aiming for will continue to increase .
In the past , we have adopted and supported young people who have been pursuing their dreams , such as Ban@@ do Man and Az@@ uki .
In the same way , the young people who follow the dream of becoming involved in it and try to support them .
I think that it is the image that a person voluntarily posts a video , but why did you think about it ?
Kobayashi : While many young people are year@@ ning for a job , there is a reality that most of them are not able to make a profit like they have .
There are not many creators who make and post videos while making al@@ bi@@ to , and creators who do not recognize the existence of family .
In this effort , we will provide the selected creators with an environment for the production of premium and con@@ ten@@ ce .
At the very beginning , I would like to support my activities by supporting the dem@@ er@@ it of the profession , which is not stable .

[ The first half of the Olympic Games ] The world 's champion , K@@ app@@ a , and the good luck of the year !
Men 's singles : Men 's singles !
A big event of b@@ admin@@ ton held in August , and a Japanese representative who won six Med@@ als at the World Championship ( Su@@ is B@@ ell@@ z@@ el ) in September 17 , the opening of the hotel in early September .
Here , while looking back at the first half of the year from May to August , the upcoming Tokyo Olympic Games , the men 's singles will be released ( September - December ) .
The b@@ admin@@ ton Olympic Games , which began in May , turned out to be the top tournament ( 500 or more ) at the end of the world championship .
In the first half of the game , two of them won in the fourth tournament and two of them , respectively .
He is the world champion@@ ships , and he is the winner of the tournament , where he can win high points of " World Ran@@ king Point " directly connected to the Olympic Games .
In addition to this , there is also the Japan S@@ 7@@ 50 .
The tournament , which has competed since May , is the S@@ di@@ er@@ man Cup ( May / China ) , Indonesia ( July / Results are more than 16 ) , Japan ( August ) and the World Championship ( August ) .
Although the number of other top players is less than that , it is scheduled to reduce the burden on the body .
August was only one of the world champion@@ ships , and the work would not be much ti@@ ghter than that of the time .
Good results are required for the consecutive competition since September .
The A@@ ce of Taiwan is strong .
Also , attention is given to young Thai people !
In the same way , he won the top tournament of Indonesia and T@@ sai ( S@@ 500 ) , and he competed in seven competitions .
In September , he also participated in the local Ta@@ ich@@ ung ( S@@ 300 ) , where he won the prize .
He originally had a strong Fi@@ j@@ k@@ ar , and he did not dare to fight .
Even if the tournament continues , there is no big problem with the performance of the match .
By winning high points in the first half and the first half , it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament .
Until last year , it was an impression that it would be impossible to succeed in explo@@ si@@ ves , but as the stability of the play surface increased this year , we were able to continue the good performance .
For the first place in the world ranking , it is likely that he will be more than ever .
In addition to these two players , the results were left in the first half of the first half of the race , and the young A@@ ce of Thailand and the Indian Cup .
He is the third player of An@@ d@@ is An@@ t@@ on@@ sen , who is fighting for a secl@@ uded army in Europe .
Although it is not possible to enter the final at the top competition , it has the power to advance to the top level , such as entering the best 4 in the 2nd tournament .
Even though there is still a rough aspect , 20 years old ( 21 years old on 18 ) , who have been able to compete against top players , has the potential to leap into the Olympic race .
In addition , he took a step in India , where he had a good match for singles .
It is necessary to be careful not only in the future , but also in the future , the thr@@ ill@@ ers , Pr@@ ano H. S. S. and K@@ eg@@ a , who is late in the future .
The new price of the cell phone is fair competition .
Rev@@ ised T@@ elecommun@@ ication Business The new price plan of the mobile phone company following the enforcement of the law .
However , it became a stop .
S@@ uga Yoshi@@ hide said last summer that " there is a margin of about 40 percent to go down , " and even though the expectations of N@@ ao were high , price competition did not occur .
It is a major cause that the full-scale entry of the temple is postponed , and the state of the three major companies continues .
For consumers , it is obvious that fair competition will make it a toll system that is easy to use .
I would like to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies .
The revised Law prohi@@ bits the settling of terminal and telecommunications charges .
Instead of selling the terminal fee at ease , it was set that the communication fee would be expensive .
The soft bank and the play@@ wright , " N@@ u , " announced a plan to maximize the number of terminals .
However , both of the two companies will be able to use " K@@ app@@ u , " which cannot be used by other companies .
At the same time , only the subscri@@ ber of the company 's own line will be assigned to a maximum of three units .
The three companies seem to continue to " enc@@ lose " to prevent the transfer to other companies .
As for L@@ ock , the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a policy to require the release of the lock immediately .
Corporate side needs to respond quickly .
The delay in communication networks , such as the base station , did not proceed as planned .
It was hoped that it would be a catalyst for the competition , but it was a good idea that I had just pushed my shoulder .
I wonder if there was a sweet taste .
The timing and price of the full-scale service is not clear .
I hope that as a company that carries social imp@@ eller , we will work on our business with a blame .
The change of the price this time was triggered by the remarks of Secretary Kan .
S@@ uga expressed dis@@ satisfaction with the three new rates : " I think the competition will begin , and I 'm not thinking of it all . "
However , it is impossible to think that the government will leave the city hall and encourage good competition .
The corporate side should advance the competition of the customer first before it is spoken by government .
The price system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare .
The consumer agency called attention as the terminal has issued ads such as " maxim@@ al , " but the consumer 's burden is more than that of consumers .
Companies must be mind@@ ful of an easy-to-@@ understand explanation so that they do not mis@@ understand users themselves .

In the form of adding the face to the face of the other person , it is the first thing .
The actual scene of overseas media is also released with video , and the former England representative also shows that it is not something that can be called " an insul@@ t , " or " a play . "

The real moment of face danger played by the US representative ...
At@@ mos@@ phere has crossed the line .
It was 29 minutes later , which was welcomed by 0-@@ 38 .
The enemy was deep and the captain of England , and when he caught the path of the way of A@@ ki , he broke down the bar@@ r@@ ance .
It was the first time I went to this place .
However , it caused the upper body not from the waist to the bottom , and put it on the upper half .
As a result , the head and head of the opponent are in contact , and the shape of the head is in .
The c@@ row was fierce and fell down .
It is a fierce protest against the fact that an English player tries to make a play that lacks authenticity .
The two military players gathered together , and I was worried about it .
As a result of T@@ M@@ O ( Video Jud@@ gment ) , the result is one by one with the aid card .
B@@ ates later with a face that looks bad , but some of them asked for a fair play .
The local media " staff " of Rugby 's New Zealand Land " is " Rugby World Cup 2019 : The United States player is playing the game , " and " English " is a special collection .
" K@@ ill has made the face of the British Star@@ r , the face of his face , " and he has become the winner of both troops . "
In the article , I would like to introduce a comment by former British representative player U@@ go Mor@@ ina , a member of the company .
He said , " It is an insul@@ t , not something that can be called , but a play . "
The United States , which lacks one match , was in the United States in 81 minutes , and was able to escape the total loss of the seal .

The Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare announced the name of the 4@@ 2-@@ 4 hospital , which was determined to have poor medical results , for the first time in public hospitals such as the National Hospital of 14@@ 5 nationwide .
In Fukui Prefecture , the Ministry of Health and Welfare inspec@@ ts the medical results of 1 public hospital , 1 public hospital and 4 facilities at Wak@@ asa Kun@@ it@@ ai Hospital of Wak@@ asa Kok@@ on@@ ai Hospital - Ori@@ da Hospital in Su@@ iz@@ u-@@ machi .
⇒ Four hospitals to be re@@ structured " standard side dishes . "
As a result of the aging of medical costs , it was necessary to encourage the reorganization and integration of hospitals in the competing areas .
He also called on the target hospital for a full-scale review of the reorganization and integration , and asked him to make a conclusion next year .
Although there is no compul@@ sion , the local em@@ irates and residents will be fore@@ seen due to the lack of clo@@ se-@@ kn@@ it hospitals .
It was announced at the meeting on the same day .
The target hospital hit 2@@ 9-@@ 1 % of the total , and there were a number of hospitals with fewer beds .
By prefecture , Niigata ( 5 % , 7 % ) , Hokkaido ( 4 : 6 % ) , Miy@@ ag@@ o@@ jo ( 4@@ 7,@@ 5 % ) , Yam@@ aguchi ( 4@@ 6-@@ 7 % ) , and Okayama ( 4 % ) .
The number of targets was the highest in Hokkaido , and the number of Oki was only zero .
The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare can respond to " acute phase " for severe patients in public and public hospitals based on data from the fiscal year 2000 , and " acute phase " for general procedures in general .
We analyzed the medical results of the ninth pol@@ yn@@ x , such as cancer and emergency care , as well as whether the competing hospital would be in the place of " 20 minutes by car . "
The target hospital should consider dis@@ charging and transferring some medical departments to other hospitals .
Medical costs have increased in the past two five years , when all the members of the group generation are seven or more .
For this reason , the Ministry of Health and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in a hospital with a total of 24@@ 6,000 beds ( 1 year and 8 years ) to 1,@@ 9@@ 0,000 floors .
Currently , the number of beds in the " high acute phase " and " acute phase " that require medical expenses is high , and the need for rehabilitation for the elderly is un@@ satisfactory .
In order to cope with aging , it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds alone but also to increase rehabilitation .
With regard to hospital restructuring and integration , each prefecture formulated the " Regional Medical Res@@ identi@@ al , " which set out the number of beds required in 2.5 years .
Although the country is divided into three districts , municipalities and medical officials are discussing , many of the local residents and em@@ bas@@ sies have maintained their mo@@ dest@@ y and the debate is difficult .
The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare intends to promote the revitalization of the debate by releasing the name of a hospital with poor track record .

On July 7 , the general training for disaster prevention , which envis@@ aged a eruption of 1 / 3 a meter , was conducted in the woods in the coastal area of Ts@@ ushima , and in K@@ abe Town .
About 40 people from around 20 institutions including the road and three towns participated in the event .
It was the first time since the Hokkaido Municipal Disaster Prevention Council formulated a evacuation plan with the evacuation of residents .
It was the first time in eight years for a wide range of training for residents to participate .
It is assumed that the mud flow spread to the town at the foot of the mountain .
When the level of the eruption warning was raised to 5 ( evacuation ) , evacuation centers were opened in both the forest and the town , and the residents moved by buses and police vehicles that each town had intended .

It is a recommended area of pig vaccine in Gifu Prefecture .
On February 7 , the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be able to make an im@@ mun@@ ized vaccine guideline for re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed pigs to prevent the spread of infected pigs .
The target area is set to nine prefectures , including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture , where pigs and wild animals have been infected .
The movement of live pigs and su@@ gar@@ cane , which have been vacc@@ inated , is limited to the area , but the distribution of processed goods is recognized .
After taking public comments to the general public , the aim is to complete the work in advance .
By using a vaccine and acknowled@@ ging the distribution of pork , it is possible that the country is no longer a " pur@@ ified country " that has been certified by international organizations , which may affect the export of meat .
Since last year 's outbreak , Japan was in a state where the position of a country of purity was temporarily kept .
In the revised draft , based on the opinions of experts on the areas where the risk of infection from wild to pigs is high , the vaccine recommended area is set .
The prefecture , which is subject to , produces a " vaccine pro@@ gl@@ am " that summar@@ izes the range , timing , number of cases , etc . , and is confirmed by the Ministry of Health , and allows the use of the vaccine .
The other seven prefectures , which are recommended for vacc@@ ination , are Sai@@ j@@ ama , Toyama , Ishikawa , Fukui , Nagano , Mie and Shiga .
When the guidelines have been revised , the local community will be determined once again by looking at the situation .
The movement of the in@@ oc@@ ulated pigs , su@@ ic@@ ides , dead bodies , and def@@ ec@@ ation is restricted to the region as a rule .
As for processed products and processed products , they are not subject to the influence of the co@@ sts and farmers on the distribution limit , and in fact they accept the distribution of the products .
We will not spread the u@@ il@@ us , so we will continue to process food sc@@ ru@@ ce .
He ple@@ ads for the safety of pigs that have been im@@ planted , and will also prevent harmful rumors .
The draft of the guideline was confirmed at the meeting of the headquarters of the headquarters of the As@@ sign@@ ment Persons held on the same day .
In the future , opinions and public comments to the prefecture will be held to the present day and new guidelines will be implemented .

As far as last year , the Australian and A League , Melbourne de Jan@@ e@@ iro , and now Japan 's representative M@@ F Ke@@ isuke , came to a surprise .
[ Video ] Ke@@ isuke , in fact , was in the game ?
It is the true fruit of the A@@ iden .
He updated his tw@@ itter at midnight on the 27th of Japan time and said , " If you don 't need money , you need to play with a great team or a great team@@ mate , " he said .
The other person who sent the " reverse offer " is Manchester United , a world-@@ famous gate .
Why did he give a great deal of relief to the Premier League 's bow club ?
The opportunity was in the Australian version " F@@ O@@ X Sports , " which was released on the 24th .
In the article entitled " Manchester United is the for@@ wards of five people with potential in the midst of a crisis of injury , " five players who are currently able to earn the present P@@ ick@@ up .
There were also names of players such as H@@ ath@@ e Be@@ en Alph@@ a , Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe Ros@@ si , and Wil@@ ref@@ le@@ ed Bon@@ nie .
Currently in United , there are emergency situations such as the MF Po@@ or P@@ og@@ ba , the DF rou@@ x show , D@@ F-@@ El@@ ick B@@ illi@@ e , the F@@ W An@@ t@@ ony Mar@@ sh@@ al , and the F@@ W Mar@@ sh@@ al Rus@@ h d .
The " red demon , " led by O@@ re@@ en@@ n@@ é Su@@ r Sh@@ al , is forced to sk@@ ate with two wins and 22 defeat in the league , and is facing challenges in the previous line of Qu@@ ir@@ ati .
It was the name that the state media named it as a new pro@@ spec@@ ter for the@@ or@@ izing .
In the article , " Str@@ ic@@ tly speaking , it is not a stri@@ ker , but as a creative side player , the co@@ venant can fill the holes filled by the An@@ do As@@ as P@@ ell@@ era . "
The score for the 18 matches in Melbourne is " a real record , " but " 3@@ 3-@@ year-old Cambodian representative is to be taken away from the man@@ ne@@ gie , and it is necessary to draw a full attention . "
Is it true that the approach of this work is ?
It is also worth noting that United is moving for Bet@@ el@@ an , which is the goal of the next Tokyo Olympics .
Free of charge to Ham@@ am@@ atsu@@ na , store , etc .
It is a mobile translation machine that l@@ ays free of charge to 50 locations in Ham@@ am@@ atsu-@@ shi .
On February 6 , the Ham@@ am@@ atsu@@ ko Chamber announced that it has completed the installation of a total of 50@@ 0.@@ 0 units to stores in Ham@@ am@@ atsu-@@ shi , with a free loan of charge for portable translation machines .
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to gather and distribute the transl@@ ators to the same area , and it is attracting attention that it will lead to improvement of the ability of inbound tourists .
The l@@ ent is divided into 2 6 restaurants , 1 3 retail stores , 7 accommodations , and 1 3 others .
It is estimated 60 % of the city 's downtown area .
We also started to show the l@@ ender to the " L@@ ent M@@ apping " app , and we made it possible to see the location of " a foreign language store " on the smartphone .
It is accessible from sites in the Ham@@ ana area of sightseeing .
In response to the seven four words , the free loan of charge was launched by nine organizations in the city under the initiative of receiving the declaration of " Japan 's In@@ bound City Hamamatsu . "
The company has purchased a total of 50 units , and will lend them two years to a mid-@@ sized business office that satis@@ fies the conditions such as the acquisition of a certificate and the introduction of cash@@ less payment .
The cler@@ k said , " I would like foreigners to open new customers in the midst of severe operating conditions . "
It is also important to see the first shot of I@@ man@@ a D@@ ora Man@@ sai .
It is a shot of the same day
One W shot is not a must , but a must .
There is also a technique called " direct d@@ ora " when you want to earn a distance with the second tap of Per@@ 5 .
The recent 1@@ W has a large h@@ ed body , and the ball is accompanied by risk , but there is a real player on the Tig@@ le Round that is the most common .
The first victory of the tour was waiting .
At the age of 24 in the professional seventh year , the figure is around 16@@ 6 , but it is now ranked seventh in the Dry D@@ ist@@ ance division ( average 30@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 2 ) .
On the other hand , one of the challenges was the fairness of Fair@@ way@@ wood .
At the beginning of spring , " I didn 't have a shot of S@@ pu@@ n ( 3@@ W ) , so I thought that I would try to do a straight d@@ ora . "
From the practice round , the ball is dropped on the grass of the rear , and the ball is fl@@ ashed , and one W is attached .
In the case where the big carry is required , it will be used to make a fus@@ s , but both sides are using the direct d@@ ora in narrow halls .
" It can be used in the hole Nam@@ ba where the line is hit and down . "
It is a record of 2@@ 70 and 2@@ 80 with a carry .
" That 's why I don 't have three W , so I can rest assured that the d@@ ora is better than 3 W . "
From the " Japan Tour Championship " in June , wood is only 1 W in the ca@@ di@@ bu@@ g .
The second longest club is the U@@ T with a total of 17 degrees left .
I am also happy to hear the ex@@ clamation of the war method that is surprised by the tour companions , which is leaked from the visible gallery .
He said that it is to " move the club to a level . "
" I don 't want to fly to the right , either on the right side or on the upper side , but I will go to the right if it is a cut road . " It is originally an ac@@ idi@@ c shot .
The ball is not caught , and it is accompanied by the risk of the sl@@ is , " so the left side can be turned off ( not on the left ) . "
It is a professional skill that I don 't want to say to Cant@@ on ...

What is the method of preventing dementia from becoming a pre@@ valence ?
Interview / sentence / sentence : Wat@@ an@@ ab@@ e-@@ yang
It is a medicine of dementia that major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals take on the challenge of research and development .
However , the relationship between dementia and living habits has been eluc@@ idated , and it has become clear that there is a possibility that it can be kept to the degree of forgotten .
I have talked to the Kinki University Hospital in the middle of my brain loss center , and I have heard about it .
dementia does not disappear .
It is the case that the drugs are waiting , but what is the current situation ?
Whether it is the difference in the degree , from ap@@ er@@ ture to severity , it is possible that everyone will become dementia when they age .
However , it is believed that it will take more than twenty years to develop new drugs for dementia .
In some countries outside Japan , the drugs called " sen@@ j@@ ill , " which are commonly used in Japan , have already been in@@ compatible with insurance , and the effects of this drug cannot be expected .
On the other hand , the number of deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents has decreased , and cancer mortality has been reduced in a rough step in the treatment of an@@ tic@@ ancer drugs .
Therefore , it is true that the number of dementia patients is increasing .
It is not something that can only be solved by people and families , but it is necessary to establish an environment where people can live safely in the region as a whole .
How to keep in mind " For@@ get "
I wonder if there are people who are prone to dementia , or who are difficult to become .
Even if it is inevitable that it will become de@@ bil@@ itating , it is possible to suppress the symp@@ tom@@ atic form only to be kept to " forget things . "
dementia is considered to be one of the life@@ sty@@ le-@@ related diseases , and people who are easy to become tend .
First of all , there is a tendency to become dementia .
dementia is regarded as one of the life@@ sty@@ le-@@ related diseases .
It is a combination of ob@@ ese , high blood pressure , sugar ur@@ inary disease , and high chol@@ ester@@ ol blood disease .
The lack of economic power also affects .
In the United States , there is a region where food tickets are distributed to the poor , but food that can be served with food tickets is a pre@@ serv@@ able ch@@ ill@@ er and p@@ iz@@ a .
People who live in an environment where they can 't cook or cook in the first place can be used .
If you eat a meal with less vegetables and cris@@ py quality , you will be able to live a life of fat and sugar .
It is poor , but it becomes ob@@ ese , and when it comes to doing it , you have to look at the TV and the body becomes un@@ reasonable .
It can be similar to that in Japan .
In addition , people who do not think of things or do not work are prone to dementia .
In order to prevent dementia , you need to read books on a daily basis and think about things .
