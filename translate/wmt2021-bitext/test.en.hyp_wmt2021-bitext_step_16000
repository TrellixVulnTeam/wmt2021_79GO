The driving of the car is dangerous !
Young people ped@@ al and mistake accidents frequently occur ( A@@ to M@@ esse Web ) - Yahoo ! News
The act of viol@@ ating road traffic law
It is a big mistake to think that this is only a problem for elderly drivers , although the number of reported accidents due to mis@@ operation such as ped@@ al tr@@ ack@@ downs is increasing .
In the case of a mistake of ped@@ aling by age ( 2015 National Police Agency data ) , the number of cases is 10@@ 80 , with a large number of age of 24 or less , exceeding 10@@ 3@@ 2 cases at the age of 7@@ 5 .
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well .
Do you take the O@@ sh@@ ale ?
Do you take safety ?
This data does not include a woman ratio or cause , but it is thought that it is often caused by the ab@@ ys@@ s of the body such as driving skills and anti-@@ cath@@ ode .
There are also women who choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day , such as ma@@ ple , sand@@ als , m@@ ule , and others who drive as they are .
There are some people who know that it is not suitable for driving , but some of them do not think about the possibility of danger at all , and others are driving un@@ intentionally .
However , driving in the sand@@ als and sand@@ als is a road traffic law .
The first is to ensure the operation of hand@@ held , brake , and other operations , and " Do not drive to harm the person who caused the accident " Article 70 " Safety driving violation . "
The other is the violation of the ordin@@ ance of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Act , which stipul@@ ates that the driver must comply with the provisions of each prefectural public safety committee .
The same is true for each prefectural government to say that it is a violation of the operation with the " driving force " which may prevent operation .
Why is it dangerous to drive a car ?
It 's light white if you think about the basics of ped@@ al operation safely .
To ensure the safe ped@@ al operation , the foot is fixed to the floor of the ped@@ al , and the legs are set to be til@@ ted against the brake , and the right leg is attached as a starting point when the accelerator ped@@ al .
At this time , it is important to firmly fix it in such a way that the movements of the k@@ uma are not related to the movements of the k@@ uma .
However , the surface area is small , and the area where the ground is fixed is fixed to the ped@@ al because the he@@ el is too high .
This is thought to lead to danger .
In addition , most cars have a floor car@@ pet@@ te , but this material is easy to use , and the he@@ el is cl@@ ut@@ tered when there is a ped@@ al , and the he@@ el is not attached .
In addition , there are cases in which the he@@ el is unable to return to the rear side of the ped@@ al and the accelerator ped@@ al .

I want to support young people who work hard with recruitment
What kind of mechanism is " adoption " ?
Kobayashi : Now , the occupation of K@@ yo has become a year@@ ning for many young people .
Elementary school students are also in the top of the job ranking they want to be in the future .
In the past , we have been supporting young people who have been pursuing the dream of B@@ ren@@ d@@ man and H@@ aj@@ ime .
In the same way , a young man who is chasing the dream of becoming a ghost is employed to support him .
I have the image that individuals are willing to post videos on their own , but why did you think about hiring ?
Kobayashi : While many young people are year@@ ning for their prof@@ essions , there is a reality that most young people are not able to earn profits that they have thought .
There are not many creators who are making and posting videos while Al@@ bi@@ to , and creators who do not recognize the existence of family .
In this initiative , we will provide the selected creators with an environment for premium and concrete production .
At the beginning , we will support our activities by providing support for the dem@@ er@@ it of the occupation , which is un@@ stable and un@@ reasonable .

[ The first half of the Olympic race ] The world champion , Ken@@ to , and the good performance of the race lead one step !
[ Men 's Sing@@ les ] [ I 'm sorry for me ! ]
A big b@@ admin@@ ton event held in August , the Japanese national representative who won six Med@@ als at the 2@@ 5th World Championship ( Su@@ is Bar@@ z@@ el ) , has completed the opening of the hotel in early September .
Here , we will look back on the first half of the Olympic race , which took part in the Tokyo Olympics next year , from May to August , and present the men 's singles ( from September to December ) .
The B@@ admin@@ ton Olympics race began in May , when the world champion@@ ships were over , the top players took part in the tournament .
In the first half of the game , the two of them won two races during the fourth tournament , and the two of them were K@@ ou@@ j@@ in-@@ do , and the Taiwanese people .
The winner of the tournament is the high points of the World Championship , which are directly connected to the Olympic race .
In addition to that , there are also Japan ( S@@ 7@@ 50 ) .
The tournament , which has been participating since May , has been the world champion@@ ships ( August ) , the S@@ di@@ er@@ man Cup ( May / China ) , Indonesia ( July 16 ) , and Japan ( August ) .
Although the number of other top players is less than that of other top players , it is a schedule that sup@@ presses the burden on the body .
August was only one tournament of the World Championship , but it would not be much more exha@@ usting than H@@ aj@@ ime .
Good results will be required in the final tournament since September .
A@@ ce of Taiwan who is strong and strong .
At@@ tention to young Thai people !
He also won the top prize in the Indonesia Cup and the S@@ 500 .
He also participated in the local Ta@@ ich@@ ung ( S@@ 300 ) in September and won the grand prize .
He is a player who has a strong fil@@ ial spirit and does not make it difficult .
Even if the tournament continues , there is no big problem with the performance of the game .
By gaining high points in the first half of the game , it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament .
Until last year , it was the impression that the explosion force was missing , but the stability in the playing field increased this year , so we can continue to perform well .
For the world ranking first place , it seems to be more than ever before .
In addition to these two players , the results were left in the first half of the game .
He is one of the three players of An@@ der@@ as An@@ ton S@@ en , who are on the side of Europe .
Although it is not possible to enter the final at the top of the tournament , the team has the power to advance to the top level , such as entering the best 4 in the second tournament .
Although there is still a rough side , the 20-@@ year-old ( 21 years old on the 18th ) , who has been able to rally against top players , has the potential to make a leap in the Olympic race .
In addition , he took a step in India where he had a good player in singles .
The S@@ rin@@ can@@ s K@@ id@@ am@@ bi , who are lag@@ ging behind in K@@ eg@@ a , and Pr@@ ana H@@ .@@ S , are also in the future .
New rates of mobile phones fair competition .
Rev@@ ision of the T@@ elecommunications Business Act The new toll plan of the mobile phone company following the enforcement of the telecommunications business law .
However , it became a stop .
It was not that the price competition did not happen , even though the expectations of Z@@ a@@ q@@ in were high .
It is important to note that the full-scale participation of these three major companies has been postponed and the ol@@ ig@@ archy has continued .
It seems that fair competition for consumers will make it easy to use fee system .
I want to ask for the efforts of each cell company .
The amended law prohi@@ bits the dec@@ ou@@ pling of terminals and communications charges .
This is because instead of selling the terminals , the communication fee was set to be expensive .
The company announced plans to maximize the use of the device .
However , the two companies will not be able to use other company lines for the last 10 days .
The company will make up to three devices for only its subscribers .
The three companies seem to continue to " enc@@ lose " to prevent the shift to other companies .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced the policy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications to immediately terminate it .
Fir@@ ms also need to respond quickly .
The reason for the post@@ pon@@ ement was that the development of communication networks such as the base station did not proceed as planned .
It was thought to be a trigger for the competition , and it was a good idea to shoulder .
It seems that there was the sweetness of the sight .
The timing of the start of the full-@@ fledged service and the fee have not been clarified .
As a company that will carry social imp@@ eller , I want you to work on the business with blame .
The change of the fee was triggered by the words of the Secretary of Japan .
Mr. Kan expressed his dis@@ satisfaction with the three new rates : " I think competition will start from now on , and I do not think that I should be doing this . "
However , it is impossible to think that the government will leave the city hall and encourage a healthy competition .
Fir@@ ms should compete in the customer 's main position before they are told by the government .
The rate system of each company is very complex and not easy .
The Consumer Affairs Agency called for attention as there are cases in which the device is selling advertisements such as " maxim@@ izing . "
The companies themselves must be respec@@ tful of their cour@@ te@@ ous and easy-to-@@ understand explanations so as to avoid the mis@@ understand@@ ings of users .

On February 26 , 2013 , the three major banks in Mie Prefecture announced that they decided to lower their withdrawal limit to prevent the damage of special fraud .
In the past three years , we have been able to hold a deposit transaction of more than 10 million yen , with a deposit of more than 10 million yen at the maximum limit of 3 years , and the deposit of the Northern Ise Ueno and Ueno .
On the first day of October , the company will carry out a reduction of the G@@ yu@@ jo and Kit@@ akami Ueno .

The black star was launched , but R@@ af@@ u play , which was performed by FL John in the second half , is called .
It is like adding a face to the face of the other party .
The actual scene is also released with video , and the former representative of England is saying , " It is not something that can be called " an insul@@ t , but it is not a play . "
[ Vide@@ os ] " In@@ sul@@ ted by the play " overseas !
The real moment of " face danger " played by the US representative ...
The passion of the fighting has passed one line .
It was the second 29 minutes that I received at 0-@@ 38 .
The enemy was deep , and the captain of England , H@@ aj@@ ime , collapsed the bar@@ ri@@ ance when he caught his path .
It was the reason why I went to this place .
However , I raised the upper body rather than the lower from the waist , and put the body on the upper half .
As a result , the head of the other party is in contact with the head , and the head is in a shape that r@@ ushes .
The fall of the rope was so fierce that it fell .
It is clearly a fierce protest against the lack of authenticity of the English player as a result of the play .
Both of the military players gathered together in one place , and they became very shy .
As a result of the T@@ M@@ O ( video recognition ) , it is a rare card with one shot .
B@@ ut@@ z left the p@@ itch with a seemingly evil face , but some of the spectators asked for fair play .
The local media " staff " of the rugby team " is " Rugby World Cup 2019 : United States players play the game , and England plays a special book .
" K@@ ill has done the same thing as the face of the British star in England , " he says .

The Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare released the 4@@ 2.4 hospital name for the first time on February 6 , when the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare announced that it has not been able to provide medical results for public hospitals such as public hospitals and hospitals in Japan .
In Fukui Prefecture , the Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare exam@@ ines the medical achievements of the 1@@ 4 public hospitals in the prefecture , and the Wak@@ asa Kun@@ it@@ achi Hospital of Wak@@ asa Kok@@ ub@@ ai , Japan .
⇒ Four hospitals to be re@@ structured " standard side dishes "
In order to suppress medical costs , which are bur@@ den@@ ing due to the aging of the population , it was necessary to encourage restructuring and integration with hospitals in competing areas .
I also asked the target hospital for a full-@@ fledged review of the reorganization and integration , and I would like to make a conclusion in the future .
Although there is no strong power , it is assumed that local em@@ pires and residents will be dis@@ cour@@ aged due to the lack of a hospital near them .
It was announced at the same day 's meeting .
The number of hospitals in the hospital was less than that of the total of 2@@ 9.@@ 1 percent , and the number of hospitals in the hospital was relatively small .
By prefecture , Niigata ( 5@@ 3,@@ 7 % ) , Hokkaido ( 4@@ 8-@@ 6 % ) , Miy@@ ag@@ a-jo ( 4@@ 7,@@ 5 % ) , Yam@@ aguchi ( 4 : 6 % , 7 % ) , and Okayama ( 4 / 3 ) .
The number of targets was the highest in Hokkaido , and the Oki rope was only zero .
The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare will be able to respond to the " acute period " for severe patients and " acute phase " in general , among public and public hospitals .
We analyzed the medical records of the nine pol@@ ls , such as cancer and emergency medical care , as well as whether the competing hospitals are located within 20 minutes by car , and judged the need for the hospital name publication .
The target hospital will be asked to consider how to dis@@ pose and transfer some medical departments to other hospitals .
Medical costs have sur@@ ged in the past two five years , when all the members of the group age more than seven five .
To this end , the Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare set the goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with a total of 12@@ ,@@ 4@@ 6,000 beds ( 8 years ) to 1,@@ 9@@ 1,000 beds .
Currently , there are many beds for " high acute " and " acute " which require medical care , and the need for rehabilitation for the elderly is un@@ satisfactory .
In order to accommodate the aging of the population , it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation .
Regarding the reorganization and integration of hospitals , each prefecture formulated a " regional medical system " that established the number of beds required for the next five years .
It is divided into three districts across the country , where local governments and medical officials discuss , but many of the local residents and em@@ ir@@ ati have maintained their modest attitude and the discussion is difficult .
The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare aims to revit@@ alize the discussion by public@@ izing the name of hospitals that have not been proven .
It is the first time in eight years ( video ) to participate in the general training of disaster prevention including the assumption of eruption , the road , etc .
The comprehensive disaster prevention training , which envis@@ aged an eruption of 1 to 3 meters , was held on July 7 in the forest and in the town of Kan@@ be , in the coastal area of the island .
Around 40 thousand people participated in the event , including officials and residents of 20 organizations such as the road and three towns .
It has been the first time since the Hokkaido Kai@@ zan Disaster Prevention Council has formulated an evacuation plan with residents ' evacuation routes .
The wide-@@ area training that residents participate in for the first time in eight years .
It is assumed that the mud flow spread to the town at the foot of the mountain .
When the alert level of the eruption was raised to five ( evacuation ) , an evacuation center was opened in the forest and the town , and the residents moved by bus and police vehicles that were used by each town .

The recommended area of pig vaccine is 9 prefectures ( Gifu Newsp@@ aper ) - News Yahoo !
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said on February 7 , to prevent the spread of the infection of the " pig " disease , it is possible to change the vacc@@ ination guidelines to the currently un@@ recognized pig .
The target area will be selected in nine prefectures , including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture , which have confirmed the infection of pigs and wild animals .
The movement of imported living pigs and p@@ oul@@ try is limited to the region , but the distribution of processed and processed foods is recognized .
After making public comments , such as public comments , the aim is to complete the process of continuing the work of Ma@@ eda .
By using a vaccine and acknowled@@ ging the distribution of pork , it is not a " pur@@ ified country " recognized by international organizations , and it is possible to influence the export of meat .
Since the outbreak of this film last year , Japan has been in a state where the status of a clean country has been temporarily preserved .
The revised proposal sets the " vacc@@ ination recommended area " based on the opinions of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild to pig .
The prefectures of the target province will produce " vacc@@ ination pro@@ m , " which summar@@ izes the range and timing of the in@@ oc@@ ulation , numbers , etc . , and can be used at the discretion of knowledge .
The other seven prefectures that have been suggested for vacc@@ ination are Sai@@ j@@ ade@@ ite , Toyama , Ishikawa , Fukui , Nagano , Mie and Shiga .
When the guidelines have been revised , the region will review the situation and make a decision again .
The movement of the in@@ oc@@ ulated pigs , fertili@@ zers , dead bodies , and o@@ ven@@ s is limited to the region as a rule .
As for products and products , they do not cover the distribution restrictions on the distribution of ch@@ ests and farmers , and in fact accept the distribution of these products .
In order not to spread the u@@ il@@ us , we will concentrate on the processing of food sc@@ ru@@ ps .
We will appeal to the safety of pigs who have been vacc@@ inated , and also try to prevent harmful rumors .
The proposal for the revision of the guidelines was confirmed at the meeting of the headquarters of the Ministry of Emer@@ itus at the same day .
In the future , the government will carry out opinion seminars and public comments to the prefectures until the day of the event and implement new guidelines .
A public approach to Ke@@ isuke and Man@@ U !
" Please offer , don 't need money . " - Yahoo ! News
September 28 ( Sat . ) 2 : 57 Deli@@ vering
In the last season , he left Melbourne and H@@ aj@@ ime of the Australian A League , and the former representative of Japan , M@@ F Ke@@ isuke , came up with amazing actions .
[ Video ] Ke@@ isuke was actually in the game ?
The true fruit of the A@@ mit@@ en is seen .
I updated my Twitter on the 27th day of the Japanese time at night and said , " Please give me an offer , I don 't need money , but I need to play with a great team and a great team mak@@ e-up approach to a club . "
The other person who sent the " reverse offer " is Manchester United , a world-@@ famous gate .
Why did he make a great deal of re@@ tur@@ ne@@ es in the Premier League of Japan ?
The reason for this is the article of the Australian version " F@@ O@@ X Sport , " which was released on 24 .
Among the articles titled " Manchester United " the five people who have the potential to win in the midst of the crisis of the wounded man , " the five players who are now able to earn it .
There were also names of players such as H@@ am Ben alpha , Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe L@@ os@@ i , and Wil@@ f@@ la@@ do Bon@@ nie .
At present , United has been in emergency situations such as P@@ oh@@ l P@@ og@@ ba , DF L@@ ock Show , DF El@@ ic B@@ illi@@ e , F@@ W An@@ th@@ ony Mar@@ sh@@ al , and F@@ W Mar@@ cus R@@ ash@@ fort .
The " Red Dev@@ il , " led by O@@ re@@ ne@@ e Su@@ r , has been forced to finish two victory and 22 defeat in the league , and is facing the challenge of the previous line of Qu@@ arti@@ i .
That 's why the state media named it as a new candidate for te@@ aming .
The article says , " If you put it tightly , it 's not a stri@@ ker , but as a creative side player , you can fill the holes that are filled with un@@ do le@@ as pel@@ era . "
The score of nine in the eigh@@ teenth game in Melbourne is " a solid record , " but " 3@@ 3-@@ year-old " is the representative of Cambodia " It is necessary to draw a full attention away from his bar@@ rage . "
Is the real approach of K@@ awa ?
It is also note@@ worthy that United will move forward for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics , which is officially announced as the goal .
The installation of the 50@@ 50 mobile machine was completed in Ham@@ am@@ uro , the store , etc .
It is a portable machine that rent free of charge at 50 locations in Ham@@ am@@ atsu-@@ city stores .
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on February 6 , that it has completed a total of 500 units in stores in the city of Ham@@ am@@ atsu-@@ shi , which is a project to rent a portable translation machine , a free of charge .
It is said that it is the first time in Japan to gather the same translator in the same region , and it is note@@ worthy that it will lead to an improvement in the ability to respond to inbound tourists .
The internal translation of the rental company is 2 3 6 restaurants , 1 3 retail stores , 7 accommodation facilities , and 3 others .
It is estimated 60 % of the city 's Chu@@ o-ku .
We have also begun to show the location of the " store for foreign languages " on smartphones .
It can be accessed from sites in Ham@@ ana Lake area .
In response to the seven four words , the Grant L@@ ent was launched with the initiative of receiving the " Japan 's One In@@ bound Tokyo City Hamamatsu " declaration by nine organizations in the city .
The company will purchase a total of 50 units , and will lend it to a mid-@@ sized office for two years , which satis@@ fies the conditions such as obtaining a certificate and introducing cash@@ less payment .
The person in charge of the office said , " I hope that it will lead to the opening of new foreign customers while the business environment is severe . "
It is the first shot of the N@@ atsume K@@ ou@@ yo .
This is the same day .
The 1@@ W shot is not a must-@@ try .
There is also a technique called " Na@@ od@@ a , " which is a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance with a second shot of par@@ a 5 .
The recent 1@@ W has a large he@@ ed product , and the ball is accompanied by risk , but there are also many players who are frequently used in the Tig@@ r round .
The first victory of the tour was waiting for him .
It is currently seventh in the dry swing division ( average 30@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 2 ) , while the age of 24 in the seventh year is around 16@@ 6 in length .
On the other hand , one of the challenges was the importance of Fair@@ weight Wood .
In the early spring , " I thought that the shot of the sp@@ awn ( 3@@ W ) was not good , so I would try to do it straight . "
From the practice round , the ball is dropped on top of the tur@@ f of the rear , and there is a chance to gr@@ ind one W .
In the case where the big carry is required , it is used for use in the case , but in the narrow hall on both sides , it is effective to use the Na@@ dra .
" It can be used in the hall Nam@@ ba , where the eye line is hit and the bottom line . "
The record of 2@@ 70 and 2@@ 80 is recorded with a carrying instrument .
" That 's why I don 't think that 3@@ W is better than 3 W , but I think it 's better to be able to feel a sense of security . "
From the June " Japan Tour Championship , " Wood is only one W in the C@@ ad@@ i B@@ ugs .
The second longest club is the U@@ T of the lo@@ ft sevent@@ een degrees .
It is also a great pleasure to hear the ex@@ clamation from the gallery that I have seen .
Cot@@ ton says that it is " to make the club a level . "
" Even if you hit this d@@ ow@@ lo@@ on or on the upper , you don 't want to go to the right if you are on the cutting road . " It is originally a sl@@ ang shot of a sl@@ ut .
The ball is not caught and accompanied by the risk of the sl@@ is , " So the left side is removed ( not to the left ) . "
It is a kind of professional skill that I don 't think about ...
