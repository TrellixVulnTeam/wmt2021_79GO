There are many incidents in which young people ped@@ al mis@@ dem@@ e@@ an@@ or ( A@@ uto M@@ esse Web ) - Yahoo !
Road traffic law violation
It has been noted that there are more reports of accidents due to mis@@ management such as ped@@ al set@@ backs , but it is a big mistake to think that it is only a problem for elderly drivers .
In the 201@@ 5-@@ year period , 10@@ 80 cases under the age of 24 are more than 10@@ 3@@ 2 .
It is important to note that it is not true that there are many elderly people , but it is also important for young people .
do you want to take your back ?
are you safe ?
This data does not include the male ratio or the cause , but unlike the elderly who are often thought to be ab@@ rupt from the decline of the body , such as driving skills and inj@@ us@@ tice , is said to be due to mis@@ dem@@ e@@ an@@ or other reasons .
Some women choose various shoes according to their clothes , p@@ asha , sand@@ als , mu@@ l , and then drive them .
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving , but others do not think of it at all , and they do not have a bad idea of it .
However , driving in sand@@ als is a road traffic method .
One is " to operate hand@@ held , brakes , and other operations reliably , " Article 70 , " " Safety driving violations , " which " should not drive to cause accidents and harm to people . "
The other is a 7@@ 1st article , which states that the driver must comply with the provisions of each prefecture 's public safety board , which prevents the traffic laws of Miyazaki Prefecture .
Even though each prefecture does not mention it , it is similar to the " violation of the operation of the car . "
Why is it dangerous ?
it 's white if you think about the basics of ped@@ aling safely .
For safe ped@@ al operations , first the legs are fixed on the floor , and the legs are set to hang on to the brake ped@@ al , and then the right foot is til@@ ted to the pole .
At this time , it is important to keep it firmly in such a way that it is not related to the raising of the k@@ uma .
However , the ground floor is small , and the legs are too small to gr@@ ind , and because the he@@ els are small and the legs are not squ@@ at@@ ted on the ped@@ als .
This may lead to danger .
Also , most cars are covered with fro@@ a car@@ pet@@ t , but this material is made with a ru@@ no@@ ff , and when a he@@ el is made when there is a steep brake , there is no ped@@ al and a he@@ el .
In addition , there are cases where the he@@ el is removed from the back of the ped@@ al and the ax@@ el ped@@ als are lost .

Elementary school students are among the top professionals in the future , and the number of young people will continue to grow .
To date , we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing after our dreams , such as B@@ and@@ man and Tok@@ en .
In the same way , it is " adoption " to recruit and support young people who are chasing after their dream of becoming obsessed .
i mean , there is an image that individuals voluntarily post videos , but why did you decide to adopt it ?
Kobayashi : While many young people are year@@ ning for their profession , there is a reality that most of them can 't afford the income that they think .
There are not many creators who are making and posting videos while making al@@ b@@ ite or creators who can 't recognize the existence of family names .

He is one of the three players of An@@ der@@ us An@@ to@@ on@@ sen@@ n , who is on the br@@ ink of an army .
Although it is not the final at the top of the competition , it is the best 4 in the second tournament .
There are still some rough faces , but 20 years old ( 21 years old on 18 days ) , who have been able to rally against top players , have a potential for a leap in the Olympic race .
In addition , She@@ pher@@ d B. took a step in India , where he had a good tennis player .
The Sur@@ ik@@ ans K@@ id@@ am@@ bi , who are at least at K@@ eg@@ a , also have to be careful not only to come out , but also to India after the war .
the new rate of cell phone is fair competition .
A new toll plan for a mobile phone company following the implementation of the T@@ elecommunications Business Act .
However , it stopped .
In the summer of last summer , S@@ uga Yoshi@@ hide said , " There are about 4 % of the remaining land , " and even though the expectations for it were high , there was no price competition .
The main reason for this is that the three major companies continue to exist .
For consumers , fair competition makes it easy to use .
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies .
The amendment prohi@@ bits the set@@ -up of terminals and communications charges .
Instead of selling the terminals , it was set to be expensive .
The Soft Bank and the Play@@ boy Company announced plans to maximize the terminals .
However , for ten days both companies will not be able to use the " lock " system on the terminals .
L@@ OT@@ TE T@@ TE@@ D@@ CO@@ MO is one of the most expensive three-@@ quarters of the terminals for only its subscribers .
The three companies continue to " enc@@ ir@@ cle " to prevent them from crossing .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs announced that it would be necessary to dis@@ continue immediately .
The company needs to respond quickly .
The delay was due to the lack of infrastructure such as the base station .
It was a good idea to be a gun@@ ner of competition .
there was a good taste .
The timing and rate of full service are unknown .
As a company that carries social in@@ fr@@ a , I want you to work on business with blame .
This time , the price change was triggered by director Kan .
Mr. Kan complained about the new charges of the three companies , " I think competition will begin in the future , and I do not fully think of it . "
However , " I don 't think that the government will push the city into full competition .
Companies should compete with their customers before they are heard from the government .
The toll system of each company is very complex and is not easy .
The Consumer Office called for attention , as the terminals had adverti@@ sed such as " maxim@@ ized " but the consumer 's burden exceeded .
Companies must be careful not to make mis@@ understand@@ ings of the users themselves .

The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare announced the first four hospitals to be named after the public hospital , including 14@@ 5 public hospitals and 24 hospitals in Japan , with " poor medical records . "

i 'm going to re@@ organize the hospital .
Due to the aging health care system , he made unusual responses to the need to re@@ organize and integrate hospitals in the competing area .
He also requested a full-scale review of the restructuring and integration into the target hospital , which he would conclude next year .
There is no strength , but the local chief@@ tains and residents are fore@@ seen from the lack of close hospitals .
It was announced at the same day .
The hospital was targeted at 2@@ 9-@@ 1 % of all hospitals , with many hospitals with fewer beds .
By prefecture , Niigata ( 5 / 7 % ) , Hokkaido ( 4 8 / 6 % ) , Miyagi ( 7 to 5 % ) , Yam@@ aguchi ( 4 / 7 % ) , and Okayama ( 4 % ) .
The number of targets was the highest of 5 in Hokkaido , and the Okinawa line was only zero .
The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare , based on data from the fiscal year 2000 , is able to conduct a survey of " high acute " for severe patients and " acute phase " for general procedures .
He analy@@ sed the medical records of the ninth pol@@ yn@@ om@@ ial , such as cancer and emergency medical treatment , and whether competing hospitals were " within 20 minutes by car " and determined the need for hospital names to be published .
The target hospital is considered to be de@@ activated and some medical services to other hospitals .
Medical expenses sur@@ ged in 25 years , when all members of the group age over 7,@@ 5 .
For this reason , the Ministry of Health and Labor aims to reduce the number of beds in a hospital of 13@@ ,@@ 6@@ ,000 beds ( 18@@ 8 ) nationwide to 19@@ ,000 beds .
Currently , there are many beds of " high acute " and " acute " periods of medical expenses , while elderly people are not well suited for high needs of rehabilitation .
In order to cope with the aging population , it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds but also to increase rehabilitation .
For the restructuring and integration of hospitals , each prefecture created a " regional medical review " which specified the number of beds needed in 25 years .
While the country is divided into 3 sub@@ divisions , municipalities and medical officials discuss it , many of the local residents and chi@@ efs maintain a modest attitude and debate is difficult .
The Ministry of Health and Labor wants to contribute to the revitalization of the debate by publishing a poorly documented hospital name .

On 7 February 2007 , the Department of Agriculture and Forestry announced that it would be able to publish vacc@@ ination guidelines for un@@ recognized pigs in order to prevent the spread of pig infection .
The target area is to select nine prefectures , including Gifu , Aichi Prefecture , which are confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild birds .
The movement of living pigs and pigs that have been vacc@@ inated is restricted to the region , but the distribution of processed goods is permitted .

The other seven provinces , which are recommended for vacc@@ ination , are Sai@@ j@@ ama , Toyama , Ishikawa , Fukui , Nagano , Mie and Shiga .
When the guidelines are revised , the area is determined again by looking at the situation .
The movement of pigs , fertili@@ zers , mol@@ ars , and ex@@ iles that have been im@@ mun@@ ized limits to the region as a rule .
As for processed goods , they are not subject to the effect of the restrictions on the distribution of co@@ asts and farmers , and in fact accept the distribution of goods .
