The Japanese representative who won six med@@ als at the 2@@ 5th World Championships in the big b@@ admin@@ ton event held in August , completed the opening ceremony for China from the beginning of September .
In this case , the first half of the Olympic race , which took place next year in the Tokyo Olympics , looked back on the game from May to August , and the men 's singles ( edited from September to December )
The b@@ admin@@ ton oly@@ mp@@ ic race , which began in May , disappeared from the top of the top player ( 500 or more ) when the world championship was finished .

Originally , he was a player with a strong f@@ id@@ ic@@ c@@ al , and he did not make it .
Even after the tournament , there is no big problem with the performance of the game .
By gaining high points in the first half of the game , the schedule of the competition to participate in the future would be easier to adjust .
Until last year , K@@ yu@@ ji had lost his explo@@ si@@ ves , but by the end of this year , he was able to continue his performance .

The scene was released with video from foreign media , and former representatives of England also said , " It is insul@@ ting and it is not a play . "
video : insul@@ t play , overseas !
The real moment of face danger is that the american representative played the role of the " face danger " because of the disturbance that the two military players were involved .
the hot fighting spirit has crossed the line .
it 's the second half of 29 minutes we picked up at 0@@ 38 .
The English chief enemy of the Imperial Family , who was deep in the crowd , defeated the Y@@ ag@@ aya and the bar@@ ance when he c@@ ashed the path of the way of tasting .
The one who went to this was Se@@ ki .
However , he did not raise his body from his waist to lower his body , so he had a strong body .
As a result , the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other 's head and they are in a shape like a head .
The temple was severely destroyed .
An English player , who apparently lacks authenticity , made a fierce protest against him .
Both military players gathered together and became excited .

The Ministry of Health , Labor , Labor , Labor , Labor , Labor , and Welfare announced the name of the four hospitals in Japan for the first time , including 1,500 public hospitals and the government hospitals in Japan .
In Fukui Prefecture , the Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare examined the medical records of the 1@@ 4 hospitals in public and public hospitals in Wak@@ asa City , including the Sho@@ den Hospital in Kaz@@ uma City .
four hospitals that are re@@ structured
As a result of the aging health care system , the hospital needed to re@@ organize and integrate with the hospital in the competitive area .
The plan is to ask the target hospital to re@@ organize and integrate , and to conclude by next year .
Although it is not strong enough , it is expected that the local chi@@ efs and residents of the area will be dis@@ oriented because of the lack of a hospital .
It was announced at the same meeting .
The total number of hospitals in the hospital was 2@@ 9.@@ 1 % , and there were many hospitals with fewer beds .
According to prefectures , Niigata ( 5.@@ 7 % ) , Hokkaido ( 4@@ 8.@@ 6 % ) , Miy@@ a-jo Castle ( 4@@ 7,@@ 5 % ) , San@@ guchi ( 4@@ 6.@@ 7 % ) , and Okayama ( 4 / 7 % ) .
The number of targets was the highest of five in Hokkaido and the only one in Okinawa was zero .
The Ministry of Health and Labor , based on data from the fiscal year of the fiscal year 2@@ 70 , is able to respond to the " high acute phase " and the " acute phase " of the hospital for severe patients .
He analyzed the medical records of the ninth degree , such as cancer and emergency medical care , and the competing hospitals ' within 20 minutes by car ' and determined the need to release the hospital name .
In the targeted hospitals , some medical departments are considered to be transferred to other hospitals .
The medical expenses increased dramatically in the past 25 years , when all members of the group age of seven and a half .
As a result , the Ministry of Health and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of beds in hospitals nationwide to 19@@ 9@@ 11@@ ,000 beds .
Currently , the number of beds for " high acute period " and " acute " is high in medical costs .
In order to cope with the aging population , it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds , but to increase rehabilitation .
For the reorganization and integration of hospitals , each prefecture established the " regional medical care system " which included the number of beds required in 2012 .
Although the national government is divided into three districts , local governments and health officials are discussing it , many local residents and chi@@ efs maintain their mo@@ dest@@ y and argue is difficult .
The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare wants to promote the debate by releasing the name of a hospital with low performance .

the real truth of A@@ scen@@ i is revealed .
In the middle of the night of the 27th of Japan , he added his own tw@@ itter , saying , you don 't need money , but you need to play with a great team or a great team mate .

In that case , the grand media named it the new candidate for the tac@@ o .
According to the article , " strictly speaking , it is possible to fill the hole in which and@@ re@@ a per@@ illa is buried , not as a stri@@ ker , as a creative side player . "
The score for the 18 matches of Melbourne J@@ o is ' a serious record , ' but it is also necessary to draw a full attention by saying that " the 3@@ 3 years of age is the best of Kam@@ pu@@ che@@ a . "

It is a drug of dementia that major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals
However , it seems that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been revealed , and that there is a possibility that it is possible to forget the absolute truth .
i was asked to speak to the head of the brain center of K@@ ind@@ ai University hospital .
there 's no need for dementia .
we 're looking for a cure for dementia , but what about the situation ?
There is a possibility that if everyone is older , it will become dementia .
However , it is still considered that it will take more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs .
The drug used in Japan is already in@@ compatible with insurance in some foreign countries , and it is not expected to be fully effective .
On the other hand , as the death of infectious diseases and accidents decreased , the death of cancer also decreased due to severe advances in treatment such as an@@ tic@@ ancer drugs .
that 's why the number of dementia patients is increasing .
It is not something that can be solved by people or family , but as a whole , we need to be able to live in a safe and peaceful environment .
how to forget things .

In the first place , people who live in environments where they can 't cook .
It becomes a diet that has a low quality of vegetables and s@@ app@@ iness , and becomes a life that is balanced with o@@ ily and sugar .
However , when it comes to poverty , it becomes obesity and ob@@ ese , you have to watch tv .
there are similar situations in Japan .
Other people who don 't think about things or work tend to be dementia .
In order to prevent dementia , we need to read books on our daily basis .
