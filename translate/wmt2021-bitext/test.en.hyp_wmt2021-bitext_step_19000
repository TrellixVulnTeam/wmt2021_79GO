In order to increase the disaster area , people living in Chiba Prefecture will be free to enter the area .

The roof is covered in a bur@@ o seat , and there is a facility that has been repaired , but half the number of restaurants re@@ started .

Tet@@ sur@@ y@@ asan AS@@ ANO ( 4@@ 8 ) - the Sapporo area , and Hide@@ yuki T@@ AM@@ AT@@ SU ( 7 2 ) - Tak@@ um@@ i-@@ no-@@ kami ( Governor of the R@@ ising River )

From 10 a.m. to 10 a.m. , the sixth Ny@@ udo Ny@@ udo I@@ go Championship was held .
The venue was all of them .
( Yas@@ ut@@ oshi NAK@@ AMURA )
In the first half of the race , the world 's champion , H@@ aj@@ ime , and the good luck of the world , led by one step .
( The men 's singles section )
The Japanese national representative who won six med@@ als at the 25@@ 5th World Championship ( Sus@@ is Bar@@ sel ) held in August , completed a joint operation at the beginning of September at the beginning of the opening ceremony .
In this section , he went back to the first half of the race , which started next year 's Tokyo Gor@@ yo ( Tokyo Olympics ) , and he published a men 's song ( edited from September to December ) .
The B@@ admin@@ ton Olympic race started in May , and when the world champion@@ ships were finished , the top players were eliminated from the top four champion@@ ships ( 500 or more ) .
In the first half of the battle , the two people who were good at the battle were K@@ udo , who won two of the four champion@@ ships , and H@@ aj@@ u in Taiwan .
He won the World Championship and the championship in which high points of ' world ranking points ' which lead to the Olympic race .
In addition to this , there is also Japan ( S@@ 7@@ 50 ) .
The competition that has been in the battle since May is held at the Battle of Sud@@ er@@ man ( May / China ) , Indonesia ( with more than 16 results ) , Japan ( July ) , Japan ( August ) .
Compared with other top players , the number of players is small , but it is a schedule to minimize the burden on their body .
In August , only one tournament of the World Championship was held , and it would not be more ti@@ ring than that of the time .
After September , the high ranking competition after September is required for good results in a continuous battle .
He was an ace of Taiwan , which was strong in the field of calligraphy .
I 'm going to pay attention to the young Thai .
He also won the top competition of Indonesia and T@@ omo ( S@@ 500 ) and took part in the seventh tournament .
In September , he also participated in the local Tai@@ hei ( S@@ 300 ) and won the championship .
He was originally a player who did not suffer from f@@ id@@ ic@@ c@@ al .
Even if the competition continues , there is no big problem with the performance of the game .
As he was able to gain a high point in the first half of the battle , he could easily adjust the schedule for the upcoming competition .
Until last year , he had an impression that he had lost his explo@@ si@@ ves , but this year , he was able to continue his performance due to increased stability in the play .
For the world ranking number one , he is likely to be more than ever .
Other than these two players , the result of the first half of the battle was the young A@@ so and In@@ dra .
And he was one of the three players of An@@ d@@ us An@@ ton SE@@ N , who was a str@@ anded army .
Although he did not advance to the finals at the top of the competition , he had the power to advance to the top , such as entering the top four at the second tournament .
Although there is still a rough side , the 20-@@ year-old ( 21 years old on the 18th ) , who was able to make Lar@@ ry against the top player , is likely to leap in the Olympic race .
In addition , J@@ ou@@ n B. took a step out of India where he had good players in Sing@@ les .
In addition , S@@ R@@ AK@@ AN@@ IS K@@ id@@ am@@ bi , who was late at K@@ eg@@ a , also had to be careful in India after the war .
The new price of the mobile phone is fair competition .
The new price plan of a mobile phone company was introduced in accordance with the revision of the T@@ elecommunications Business Act .
However , it was stopped by O@@ sho .
In the summer of last summer , Yoshimasa K@@ AN insisted that ' there was a limit of about 40 percent ' and even though the expectations of him were high , the price was not raised .
It is a big reason why the three major companies have been in a state of decline since the full-scale entry of the temple was postponed .
For consumers , it is likely that the price system is easy to use due to fair competition .
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies .
The revision law prohi@@ bits the c@@ et@@ ting of the terminal and the communication fees .
Instead of selling the devices , it was set that the amount of communication fees would be cut .
The soft bank and the play card reader ( also known as ' H@@ en ' ) announced the plan to make the device the biggest .
However , for each of the two companies , ' K@@ yo ' is a device that can 't be used by other companies for 10 days .
Only the contractor of the company 's own TE@@ D@@ C@@ AD@@ O was appointed as one of the three largest devices .
These three companies are projected to continue the ' enc@@ ir@@ clo@@ pedia ' that prevents them from going to other companies .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications had a policy of requiring the government to dis@@ continue immediately .
The companies need to respond quickly .
This is because the maintenance of communication networks such as the base station did not proceed as planned .
He was expected to be a trigger for the competition of K@@ yo , and his shoulder was cut off .
It seems that there was a sweetness .
The time and price of full-@@ service is unknown .
As a company that carries social in@@ fl@@ a , I want you to work on the business with blame .
The change in the fare was triggered by the statement of director Kan@@ sei .
The S@@ uga clan complained about the new price of the three companies , saying , " I think competition is going to begin . I don 't think I 'm going to be able to do that . "
However , it is impossible to think that ' kan@@ jo ' ( competition of government ) would drive the city to the ground and encourage the city to be healthy .
The companies have to compete with their customers before they talk to them .
The price system of each company is very complex , and it is not easy to do so .
The consumer agency called attention to the fact that the terminal adverti@@ ses such as ' the biggest one . '
We need to be careful and be careful not to make mistakes by companies .

This is the real moment in the face danger of the United States , where the players of the two armies went into chaos .

The enemy force was so deep that when the main commander of England captured the path of A@@ me@@ kata , he broke the bur@@ ance .
It was J@@ o .
However , he woke up the upper body rather than from the waist down , and he was severely injured in the upper half .
As a result , the head and the head of the opponent are in contact with each other , and they are in the form of a head@@ -on .
He was so fierce that he fell into it .
It is clear that he made a fierce protest by the English player trying to make an effort to play without authenticity .
The players of the two armies gathered together , and it was empty .
As a result of T@@ M@@ O ( video confirmed ) , he used a L@@ ed Card to make his debut .
Although B@@ atsu left P@@ itch with a bad face , some Kan@@ shu asked for a fair play .
The local media ' staff ' of the rugby company , called ' rugby W Cup , ' is a special collection of ' rugby w@@ .@@ 19 : American players ' show up and show up ' by English players .

On February 6 , the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare announced the name of four public hospitals , such as the National Government Hospital and the National Hospital of Japan , for the first time that they judged that they had not been able to provide medical results .
In Fukui Prefecture , the Ministry of Health and Welfare examined the results of the treatment of four public and public hospitals , one of the four national hospitals in K@@ uni City , and the Sho@@ den Hospital in Wak@@ as@@ a-@@ machi , four provinces .
Four of the hospitals that are being re@@ formed , the standard welcome .
In order to control medical expenses , which was infl@@ ated due to aging , it was necessary to re@@ organize and integrate the hospitals in the competing areas .
He also requested the target hospital to re@@ organize and integrate , and he made a decision next year .
Although it does not have a strong power , it is expected that local chi@@ efs and local residents would come to an end due to the loss of a hospital .
It was announced at the meeting on the same day .
The number of targeted hospitals was two to one percent , and there were many hospitals with fewer beds .
In each prefecture , Niigata ( 5-@@ 3 / 7 % ) , Hokkaido ( 4@@ 8-@@ 6 % ) , Miy@@ a-jo Castle ( 4@@ 7-@@ 5 % ) , San@@ guchi ( 4 / 7 % ) and Okayama ( 4 / 3 % )

The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare , based on data from fiscal year 25 , can handle ' acute period ' for public and public hospitals , and ' acute period ' for patients with severe conditions .
He analyzed the results of the nin@@ e-@@ degree clinic , such as cancer and emergency medical treatment , and the competing hospitals were in the place of ' within 20 minutes by car , ' and judged the need to be published .
In a hospital that is subject to the subject , it is necessary to stop and transfer some medical courses to other hospitals .
The cost of medical care increased rapidly in two five years , when all the members of the entire generation were seven or more .
For this reason , the Ministry of Health and Welfare set a goal to reduce the number of beds of a hospital to 16@@ ,000 beds in one year .
Currently , there are many beds of ' high acute period ' and ' acute period ' that require medical expenses , and the need for re@@ ha@@ b for the elderly is not enough .
In order to cope with aging , it is necessary to not only reduce the number of beds but also increase the number of beds for rehabilitation .
In order to re@@ organize and integrate the hospital , each prefecture created a ' regional health care system ' that specified the number of beds required for two or five years .
Although the whole country is divided into three nine areas , it is discussed by local governments and medical people , many local residents and chi@@ efs maintain their attitude and the discussion is difficult .
The Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare wants to promote the discussion by announcing the name of a hospital with little success .
It was a wide area , after 18 years ( video ) , and it was an electronic version .

On February 2 , the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said that , in order to prevent the spread of the infection of ' to@@ on ' ( literally , " pig " ) , it was possible to vacc@@ inate pigs that were not recognized .
The target area is a policy to select nine prefectures , such as Gifu and Aichi Prefecture , which have been confirmed to be infected by pigs and wild animals .
The movement of living pigs and animals that have been vacc@@ inated is restricted to the region , but the distribution of processed goods is accepted .
After a public comment ( an opinion public invitation ) for the general public , if it is too early , it will be completed .
By using a vaccine to allow distribution of food such as dried bon@@ ito , it is not a ' clean country ' which was certified by the international organization , and it is possible that it affected the export of pork .
Since last year , Japan was temporarily in the middle of holding the position of a clean country .
In the revision plan , based on the opinion of experts , ' the recommended area for vacc@@ ination ' was set up for areas where the risk of infection from the wild to the pigs was high .
The target prefecture produced ' vacc@@ ination pro@@ m , ' which included the amount of im@@ mun@@ ization , the period of time , the number of heads , and the like , and approved the use by the ministry of knowledge .
The other seven prefectures , which are recommended for vacc@@ ination , are Sa@@ id@@ ama , Toyama , Ishikawa , Fukui , Nagano , Mie and Shig@@ iga .

In the future , the opinions of the prefecture and public comments will be held until 7 days , and the new guidelines will be enforced .

Is it true ?
It is also note@@ worthy that United is going to move due to Bet@@ ell@@ an , who is publicly stated that he will participate in Tokyo Olympics next year .

One W shot is not necessarily a hit .
When you want to make a distance with a second punch of a p@@ ar 5 , there is also a technique called " J@@ od@@ ora . "
In recent times , 1 W has a large amount of h@@ ed body size , and the ball is accompanied by risk , but there are many players who are serious on the Tig@@ ers round .
He was the first person to win the tour .
Although he was 24 years old in the seventh year of professional life , he was 16@@ 6 cm long , he was ranked seventh in the dry swing division ( average 30@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 2 ) .
While R@@ ong Sho@@ t was intended to be accepted , one of the challenges was the work of F@@ ai@@ ew@@ lywood .
In the spring , he opened his eyes saying , " I thought I would try to do a Na@@ od@@ ora because I couldn 't get a shot of S@@ pu@@ n ( 3@@ W ) . "
From the practice round , a ball falls on a grass in a can@@ opy , and one W is added to it .
In the case where big@@ -@@ cal@@ lie is required , it is used for practical use , but on both sides , Na@@ od@@ ora is used in small halls .
" It can be used in a hall where the eyes are sl@@ am@@ med . "
In the Dan@@ do measuring instrument , he recorded 2@@ 70 to 2@@ 80 .
And he said , " That 's why we don 't have three W . "
From the ' Japan Tour Championship ' in June , only one W of wood is included in C@@ adi@@ bu@@ g .
The second longest club is U@@ T at 17 degrees L@@ op .
I 'm also glad to hear from the gallery that I 've seen .
It 's like , " To make a club a level . "
It 's like , " I 'm going to the right , I 'm going to the right , and I 'm going to the right , and I 'm going to do this . "
The ball is not caught , and it is accompanied by the risk of S@@ ra@@ is , but the left side can be removed ( the left side is not mess@@ ed up ) .
It 's a professional skill that I don 't know about .

What are the ways of preventing them from becoming dementia ?
Inter@@ viewer / mon / W@@ AT@@ AN@@ ABE no Y@@ yo
It is a drug of dementia that is cont@@ ested by major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals for research and development .
However , the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is being clarified , and it has been discovered that there is a possibility that we can keep things in our hearts .
While I was in the brain of the Kintetsu University Hospital , I heard about it .
There 's no dementia .
- The prevention of dementia , the treatment drugs are waiting for you , but what is it ?
There is a difference in the number of times , from one person to another , from one person to another to another .
But it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop a new drug of dementia .
The medicine that is often used in Japan , called Pe@@ j@@ il , is already out of insurance in some countries overseas , and it is not expected to be a complete cure .
On the other hand , as the deaths of infectious diseases and accidents decreased , cancer deaths also decreased in the treatment of anti-@@ cancer drugs , people could live longer .
So it 's true that we have more dementia patients .
Instead of being able to solve by a real person or a family , we need to be able to create an environment in which we can live in a safe neighborhood .
How to forget things .
Is there anyone who is vulnerable to dementia or who is difficult to become ?
Even if you can 't avoid becoming a ben@@ ign , there is a possibility that you can just hold the symp@@ tom down and be able to stay at least as much as you can .
We think that dementia is one of our lifestyle diseases , and we tend to be more likely to be .
Well , first of all , people in K@@ app@@ o tend to be dementia .
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases .
It 's a combination of ob@@ ese , high-@@ blood pressure , sug@@ ary ur@@ inary disease , and hyper@@ chol@@ ester@@ ol .
There is no economic power .
In fact , in the United States , we have a food ticket called a food ticket to the poor , but the food that you can get with a food ticket is an exist@@ ent frozen ham@@ burger or a p@@ iz@@ a .
We can 't use gas or electricity , and we can use people who don 't have food in the first place .
It turns out that it 's a food that has fewer vegetables and less quality , and it turns out to be a life that has a little fat or sugar .
But if you 're poor , you 're ob@@ ese , and if you 're going to do it , you 're going to have to look at TV , and you 're going to lose your body .
There is a similar situation in Japan .
In addition , people who don 't think about things tend to be dementia .
In order to prevent dementia , you have to read books every day and think things .
