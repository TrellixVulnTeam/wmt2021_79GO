Article 70 " Safety driving violations " which stipul@@ ates that " hand@@ lers , brakes , and other operations must be operated reliably , " and " Do not drive to harm people in accidents . "
The other is the violation of the Public Safety Board of Vehic@@ les , which requires that the driver comply with the requirements set forth by the prefectural public safety committee .
Even if not mentioned in each prefecture , it is the same as saying that it is a violation of driving with " the possibility of driving operation . "
Why is it dangerous to drive in K@@ il@@ i ?
It is light white if you think about the basics of ped@@ al operation safely .
For safe and secure ped@@ al operation , the foot is fixed to the floor of the ped@@ al , and the leg is placed on the right leg when stepping on the accelerator ped@@ al .
At this point , it is important to be firmly fixed as if not due to the movement of K@@ arma .
However , the ground surface is small , the ground surface is small , and the leg is not squ@@ are@@ ly adjusted with he@@ el height .
This is thought to lead to danger .
In addition , most cars have a flo@@ or car@@ pet@@ te , but this material has a rough handle , and when the ped@@ al is sl@@ ated , the he@@ el is not sl@@ ated when the brake is tight .
In addition , there is a case that the he@@ el is no longer able to return the accelerator ped@@ al to the rear of the ped@@ al when stepping on the ped@@ al .

In addition to these 2 players , the young A@@ e@@ ba and India were left in the first half .
And he is one of the three players of An@@ ders An@@ t@@ on@@ sen , who is fighting alone as the European team .
Although there is no final entry in the top tournament , it has the power to advance to the top level by entering the best 4 in the 2nd tournament .
Even though there is still a rough side , 20 years old ( 21 years old on 18 ) has become a big leap in the Olympic race .

New price of mobile phone fair competition : Hu@@ i
The new price plan of a mobile phone company following the enforcement of the T@@ elecommunications Business Act .
However , it stopped high .
Even though Yoshi@@ hiro Kan said that there was a " 40 % lower area " last summer , expectations for him were high , and the price race did not occur .
It is a major reason that the three major companies continue to have an ol@@ ig@@ archy .
For consumers , fair competition makes them easy to use .
We would like to seek the efforts of each mobile company .
The amended law prohi@@ bits the c@@ et@@ ting of terminals and communication fees .
Instead of selling the terminals , communication fees were set to be high .
Soft banks and playing cards ( N@@ Y ) announced plans to maximize the device .
However , both companies cannot use other company lines for 100 days .
Only the subscri@@ ber of the line will be eligible for a maximum of 3 install@@ ments .
3 companies seem to be continuing to " enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ate " to prevent them from getting on with other companies .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications provided a policy to cancel immediately .
The company needs to respond quickly .
The extension of the communication network such as the base station did not proceed as planned .
It was expected to become a trigger for competition , but it was a good idea .
There was a sweet taste .
The time and price of full-@@ fledged services are not clear .
As a company that seeks to carry out social in@@ fr@@ a , I would like to work on the business with a charge .
The change in the rate was triggered by the remarks of Secretary Kan .
Mr. Kan complained about the new rates of the three companies , " I think the competition will begin , and I do not fully think that it will continue . "
However , " Kan@@ jin will not be able to change the city and promote a healthy competition .
The corporate side should be able to compete with the top of its customers before being told by the government .
The rate system of each company is very complex and is not easy .
The Consumer Agency called attention to the fact that the terminal may out@@ weigh the burden of consumers while advertising such as " max . "
Companies themselves must be careful and atten@@ tive to explain their mis@@ understand@@ ings .

The United States , which lacked a match , missed a total loss in 81 minutes .
However , the play of K@@ il@@ i left behind a negative after@@ taste .
The Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare released the first four hospital names on June 6 , which determined that the number of public hospitals such as 14@@ 5 public hospitals and Japan Red was poor .
In Fukui Prefecture , the Ministry of Health and Welfare exam@@ ines the medical record of 1@@ 4 public and public hospitals in Japan .
[ 4 ] [ 4 ] Re@@ structured hospitals
Due to an aging and growing medical cost control , it was necessary to re@@ organize and integrate with hospitals in conflict areas .
The idea is to ask the hospital for a thorough review of restructuring and integration , and to bring the conclusion to the next year .
Although there is no strong force , local chi@@ efs and residents are fore@@ seen from the un@@ favorable view that there will be no relatives .
It was announced at the same meeting .
The number of hospitals was relatively small compared to 2@@ 9-@@ 1 % of the total .
By prefecture , Niigata ( 5@@ 3-@@ 7 % ) , Hokkaido ( 4@@ 8-@@ 6 % ) , Miy@@ a-jo Castle ( 4@@ 7-@@ 5 % ) , Yam@@ aguchi ( 4@@ 6-@@ 7 % ) and Okayama ( 4 % )
The number of targets was the highest in Hokkaido , and Oki no Tad@@ ashi was the only zero .
The Ministry of Health and Welfare will be able to respond to " acute period " and " acute phase " for severe patients among public and public hospitals based on data from the year 20 .
We analyzed the results of nine pol@@ yn@@ om@@ ials , such as cancer and emergency medical care , and whether the conflic@@ ting hospitals were located within 20 minutes by car .
The target hospital will be examined by dis@@ continuing or transferring some departments to other hospitals .
Medical expenses sur@@ ged in the past 25 years , when all members of the group are over 7 .
For this reason , the Ministry of Health and Welfare aims to reduce the number of beds in a hospital with 14@@ 6,000 beds ( 18 years ) to 19@@ ,000 beds .
Currently , there are many beds for " advanced acute stage " and " acute period " for medical expenses , while the elderly are not suitable for high needs rehabilitation .
In order to cope with aging , it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds alone but also to increase rehabilitation .
Regarding the reorganization and integration of hospitals , each prefecture established a " regional medical care facility " that specified the number of beds required in 2 years .
Although the country is divided into 3 nine wards and is discussed by local governments and medical officials , many local residents and chi@@ efs have maintained a modest attitude and the debate is difficult .
The Ministry of Health and Welfare wants to promote discussions by announcing the name of a hospital with poor track record .
This is the first time in 18 years ( video ) by the general public training of disaster prevention such as the road
The general training for disaster prevention was conducted on June 7 in To@@ shima , in the forest and Kan@@ abe town .
About 40 people from 20 organizations including roads and 3 towns participated .
This was the first time since the Hokkaido Fire Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan incorporating the evacuation of residents in K@@ il@@ i .
It was the first time for the residents to participate in a wide range of training .
It is assumed that the mud flow reached to the town of the foot of the mountain .
When the level of the volcanic police level was raised to 5 ( evacuation ) , an evacuation center was opened in the town of K@@ yo , and residents moved by bus and police vehicles .

The recommended area of pig vaccine ( Gifu Shimbun ) - Yahoo ! News
On February 7 , the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be able to vacc@@ inate the anti-@@ vacc@@ ination guidelines for un@@ recognized domes@@ tic@@ ated pigs in order to prevent the spread of domes@@ tic@@ ated den@@ zo disease .
The target area is to select nine prefectures , including Gifu and Aichi Pref@@ ectures , which have been confirmed by pigs and wild dogs .
The movement of vacc@@ inated living pigs and goats is limited to the region , but distribution of processed goods is accepted .
Through public comments ( public comments ) to the general public , we aim to complete the work of N@@ ich@@ u quickly .
By using vaccines and ad@@ mitting the distribution of j@@ ars , it is possible to lose the influence on the export of ton@@ gu@@ es by the international organization .
Since last year 's launch , Japan has been in a state of temporary retention .
In the revised proposal , based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild bo@@ vine to pig , we set the " recommended area of vacc@@ ination . "
The target prefecture will produce a " vacc@@ ination pro@@ gra@@ m " that summar@@ izes the range , time , and number of persons who have been vacc@@ inated , and may be used by the ministry .
The other seven prefectures , which are recommended for vacc@@ ination , are Sai@@ ki , Toyama , Ishikawa , Fukui , Nagano , Mie and Shig@@ iga .
The region will review the situation and decide once the guidelines are revised .
The movement of vacc@@ inated pigs , fertili@@ zed , mol@@ ded , and per@@ ished is restricted to the region as a rule .
The distribution of products and products is not covered in accordance with the impact of cro@@ ch@@ s and farmers on distribution restrictions , and in fact they accept the distribution of rice .
Because it does not spread the u@@ il@@ us , the process of food go@@ omi is done .
It also encourages the safety of the in@@ oc@@ ulated pig and works to prevent damage to reputation .
The proposed amendments were confirmed at the meeting of the T@@ MG at a meeting held on that day .
In the future , opinions and public comments will be held until 7 days and new guidance will be implemented .

[ Video ] Ke@@ isuke , were you in the game ?
The true fruit of the A@@ iden
I updated my tw@@ itter on the 27th of Japan at midnight , " Please give me an offer , I do not need money , but I need to play with a great team or a great team mate . "
I sent the " reverse offer " to Manchester United , a world famous gate .
Why did K@@ yo play a great re@@ qu@@ est in the Premier League 's Tur@@ ns Club ?
It was originally published in the Australian version of F@@ O@@ X Sports on 24th .
In the article titled " Manchester United is the injured , 5 F@@ W with the potential " in the crisis , there are currently 5 players who can win .
Among the players such as H@@ ath@@ em Ben Alph@@ a , Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe Ros@@ si , and W@@ ill@@ af@@ ra@@ d Bon@@ nie , there was also a name for him .
Currently , at United , injured people such as MF Po@@ l P@@ og@@ uba , DF R@@ oot Show , DF Er@@ ick By@@ ley , F@@ W An@@ t@@ ony Mar@@ sh@@ al , F@@ W Mar@@ cus Rus@@ h F@@ W are in an emergency .
" Red Dev@@ il , " directed by Or@@ er@@ en@@ an@@ na@@ e S@@ al Sh@@ all , was forced to win 2 wins and tw@@ itch in the league , and is challenged by the fron@@ t@@ line cr@@ ori@@ ety .
That 's why the wealthy media named it a new war test for te@@ ac@@ up .
In the article , " Str@@ ic@@ tly speaking , not a stri@@ ker , but as a creative side player , the co@@ venant of De@@ pot can fill the hole that An@@ dr@@ as Per@@ l@@ era is filling . "
In the 18 games of Melbourne K@@ ia , 9 points are " tight records , " but " 3@@ 3-@@ year-old H@@ aj@@ ime is away from the Cambodian representative and needs full attention . "
Is the approach of K@@ ind@@ ai real ?

On February 6 , the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce announced that it has completed a total of 50 units in Hamamatsu city stores by lending mobile translation machine " R@@ yo " to member offices .
It is the first time in Japan that the translator will be distributed in the same region .
There are 3 restaurants , 1 3 retail stores , 7 accommodations , and 3 others .
The city 's middle district is about 60 % .
The introduction of the loc@@ ality app " L@@ ent to G@@ UR@@ U@@ M@@ AP@@ s " started , so that the location of " Foreign Language Support Store " on the smartphone can be understood .
It is available from sites in the Lake Ham@@ ana area .
The free lending of 7@@ 4 words was initiated by nine organizations in Japan with the initiative to receive the Japan 's first inbound city of Hamamatsu .
The company has bought 50 units and l@@ ent it to a small business site for two years , which has fulfilled the conditions such as ob@@ fus@@ c@@ ation and cash@@ less settlement .
The person in charge of this office said , " I want to connect to the opening of a new foreign customer while the business environment is tough . "

This is the first shot of the day
1 W shot is not a must for you .
There is also a technique called " Na@@ od@@ ora , " which t@@ aps the ball on the ground when you want to make a distance with a second stroke of pur@@ 5 .
The recent 1@@ W has a big he@@ ed product , which causes the ball to be ris@@ ked , but there are some players who are often faithful on the Tig@@ ers .
The first victory of the tour was Kan@@ ei .
At the age of 24 , the seventh year of the professional is now number 7 ( average 30@@ 4.@@ 0@@ 2 ) in the dry swing division division while the length is 16@@ 6 l@@ aps .
One of the challenges was the quality of Fair@@ way@@ wood , while he wanted to get a shot .
In the spring , I thought I would try to do a straight d@@ ora , because I couldn 't get a shot of a sp@@ un ( 3@@ W ) .
From the practice round , the ball is thrown off on the grass of the l@@ ily , and 1 W is sl@@ ated .
In the case where big car@@ ies are required , Na@@ od@@ ora is utilized in narrow halls .
" It can be used in the hall where the eyes are sl@@ ated . "
A record of 2@@ 70 ~ 2@@ 80 was recorded in the Dan@@ do instrument .
" That 's why there is no 3@@ W .
From the " Japan Tour Championship " in June , only 1 W of wood is in the C@@ ad@@ y@@ bug .
The second longest club is U@@ T at 17 degrees L@@ of@@ t .
It is also a pleasure to hear the ex@@ clamation of war from the gallery you saw .
Ko@@ z said that it is to turn the club into a level ( Mizu@@ hira ) .
Even if you hit D@@ au@@ low@@ n or the upper part , you can 't fly straight .
The ball is not caught , and it is accompanied by the risk of sl@@ is , " So the left side can be removed ( not played on the left ) .
It is an un@@ imagin@@ able professional technique to tell Cant@@ an .

In the first half of the year , I thought that I could do so in the second half , but the put@@ ter was not able to exc@@ el , so I was there .
Did you see the 6th Eag@@ le , No. 7 win ?
Even after hitting # 4 , there was still a par@@ -@@ 5 , so if I was doing it with a return , Chi@@ p Inn Eag@@ le came at No. 6 .
Even No. 7 was a chance to get caught , but it was a good thing to do in the second half .
What have you gained in this tournament ?
Recently ( in the shot ) I was not good at the kitchen , so it was good that Fe@@ a W@@ ay was able to do well in a narrow course .
R@@ ough was also a course that changed the way rough hit and distance , so I did not have much ( experience ) so I studied well .
What is the difference from the ordinary tournament ?
It was possible to shoot a camera ( such as Sum@@ a ) .
I didn 't care at all , but the gallery was taking videos .
Other than that , I didn 't change much , but it was just a competition where there were few Japanese players , so I went to the game with the feeling of " not losing to overseas players . "
The second half will continue , but if you don 't win 1 or more , you can 't win another win , and you will also win the Z@@ O@@ Z@@ O Championship .

There is a difference from per@@ ennial to severe , and everyone may become a dementia .
However , it is thought that it will take more than 20 years to develop a new drug of dementia .
The drug , commonly used in Japan , has already been in@@ eligible for insurance in some countries abroad , and it is not expected to have an explicit effect .
On the other hand , people can live longer , as infectious diseases and accidents have decreased , and cancer mortality has also decreased by a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary step toward treatment of an@@ tic@@ ancer drugs .
Therefore , it is true that the number of patients with dementia is increasing .
It is necessary to improve the environment in which people and families can live with peace of mind throughout the society .
How to keep things about " forgotten . "
- Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or is difficult to become ?
Even though it is inevitable to become a dementia , it is possible to be kept in " for@@ getting " by reducing the symptoms only after completion .

There is a similar situation in Japan .
In addition , people who do not think of things or work tend to be dementia .
In order to prevent dementia , it is necessary to read books and think things constantly .
