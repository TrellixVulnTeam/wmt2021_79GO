From the morning to the end of the morning , the On@@ -@@ go Championship is held .
All of the venues are also present .

In the first half of the Olympic Games , the world 's champions , Shig@@ eru Su@@ gi@@ wa , and his strong fe@@ athers are the first step in the race .
It is a man who is a man who is a male singer .
The Japanese representative , which was held in August , won six mil@@ k@@ admin@@ ton events , which was held in the second World Championship in the 5th World Championship , and completed the opening day of the September 17 , which was held .
Here , we look back on the first half of the competition from May to August , where the Olympic Games held in the Tokyo Olympic Games next year , and we wanted to edit the male singles in September .
The B@@ admin@@ ton Olympic Games started in May , and the tournament was over 500 or 4 for the top tournament where the top player was in the world championship .
In the first half of the game , two of the two won the 4th tournament , and two people in Taiwan , Shig@@ eru Su@@ gi@@ yama , and Taiwan , Shig@@ ar@@ aki , who won the first prize .
The World Championship , Ken@@ zo , won the tournament where you can get a high point of the world ranking points connected to the Olympic Games , with Indonesia 's 10@@ 00@@ 000 S@@ 10@@ 000 , and the World Championship .
In addition to that , the Japan Japan Japan 7@@ 50 has also been the case .
In May , the tournament has been held in the competition , in April of the group 's competition , in April 2019 , the result of Indonesia 's July 7 , 2013 , the Japan Championship , and the World Championship in April .
Although the number of other top players is small , it is scheduled to reduce the burden on the body .
In August , only one tournament of the World Championship would be much more than the time of the year .
A good result of the competition from September onwards is expected to be held in a continuous manner .
A@@ ce of a strong Taiwan .
The young people in Thailand are also interested in attracting attention .
In addition to Indonesia , Ken@@ yan and A@@ mano , who won the championship at the top of the 500 Games , won the seventh tournament .
In September , he was also a member of the local Ta@@ is@@ eki S@@ 300 , and won the championship .
Originally a player who is not suffering from fil@@ ament .
Even if the tournament continues , there is no major problem with the performance of the game .
By earning a high point in the first half of the game , it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming competition .
Until last year , it was an impression that could be an explosive force , but it was possible to continue its positive performance by increasing stability in the play .
For the world rankings , it seems to be a partner for more than ever .
In the first half of the game , the results were left in the first half of the game , and young people in Thailand and India , A@@ so and India .
And three players in An@@ der@@ is An@@ th@@ ane , who are trying to be an independent military in Europe .
Although there is no final entry at the top competition , he has made his strength to win at the top level , such as entering the best 4 in the competition .
Although there are still many rough aspects , it is likely that the 21st year old age of 20 , 18 , which has become possible to be a rally with top players .
In addition , it was a step in India , with good players in singles .
It is necessary for India to take care of the sl@@ an@@ th Ke@@ id@@ am@@ bi , who has been late in K@@ eg@@ iga .
The new charge of the cell is fair competition .
A new charge plan for the mobile phone company , which is accompanied by the amendment of the telecommunications business law .
However , it became a halt .
He said , " There is an area where there is an end to the end of the year , and the expectations for the development were high , but the price competition did not occur .
It is a major factor that is the fact that the full-scale participation of the company has come to the fore , and the development of the major companies continues .
For consumers , it is a fair competition that can be used for consumers .
I want to ask for the efforts of the mobile companies .
The revised law prohi@@ bits separ@@ ating terminal and communication fees .
It was because the communication fee was set to be too high , instead of selling the terminal .
The sof@@ t-@@ bank and the Ke@@ isei bank announced a plan to maximize the terminal .
However , both of the two companies are a system that can be used by other companies .
In addition to the contract of your own line , you will be able to make up your device with the maximum number of terminal generations .
It seems that both companies and companies continue to continue to use " enclo@@ sures " to prevent the transfer to other companies .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications expressed the policy that the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications needs to be able to cancel it immediately .
Companies need to respond quickly .
It was because the development of communication networks such as the base station did not progress as planned .
It is a good idea to have a shoulder , just as it was expected to become a catalyst for competition .
Do you think that there was a sweetness in the eyes ?
At the beginning of a full-scale service , the service has not been clarified .
I would like to work on the business with a blame as a company to be a member of society .
The reason for this change was the opportunity for the President of S@@ uga Kan .
Mr. S@@ uga said , " I think that competition will start in the future , and I don 't think that it is good . "
However , it is not possible that the " government-@@ made " will bring about the city and promote a healthy competition .
The corporate side should develop the competition for the customer 's first place before the government is placed .
The charge system for each company is very complex , and it is not easy to compare .
The Consumer Agency called attention as there are cases where the burden of the consumer is exceeding the burden of the consumer .
We need to take care of the explanations that are easy to understand in mind so that the company does not make the mistake of users .
The amount of withdrawal limit is reduced to 50 million yen in the total amount of withdrawal limit .
He announced that he decided to reduce the amount of withdrawal limit due to the special fraud in order to prevent damage from the damage of special fraud .
A total of over 50 million yen in the past , an automatic deposit for the past year , and a total of over 50 million yen for withdrawal transactions with a certain amount of money .
In October , the San@@ kyo and Ise Ueno Shrine will be able to reduce the number from November .
In the prefecture , there is a number of special fraud cases , which are subject to the protection of the bank and police concerned , and that is important as long as possible .
In addition to the Nar@@ ash@@ ira and Nar@@ uto room , there is a Japanese newspaper .
The Japan Sum@@ o Association has announced the approval of the Japanese Sum@@ o Association to the Nar@@ uto Room , the O@@ sam@@ u Su@@ gi@@ yama , with the death of the Japanese sumo wrest@@ ler who is the Japanese sumo wrest@@ ler .
In the Nar@@ uto room , the same time is the same time as the room .
The master of the master , Kazu@@ yuki Ok@@ as@@ awa , who is a master of the master of the master , is a young man who is from the room .
In the future , the situation was discussed in the future .
In the Nar@@ uto room , there is a sumo sumo wrest@@ ler who is the same as a crane dragon , and the ten fog horse from Mongolia .

Even after I was in the fourth place , I was still in the parking lot .

In prevention of dementia , it is a way to keep up to the degree of forget and to keep in mind .

A major pharmaceutical company and university hospital challenge research and development , and is a drug for dementia .
However , it seems that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been eluc@@ idated , and it is possible that it can be kept in the degree of forget .
I have been talking about the life of the Fukushima University Hospital .
dementia is not lost .
It is possible to wait for treatment drugs .
It is possible for everyone to become aware of the age of age and age .
However , it is thought that it would take more than twenty years to develop new dementia drugs .
The drugs used in Japan are already in@@ compatible with insurance in some countries abroad .
On the other hand , people have been able to live in a long time , while the death of infectious diseases and accidents decreased , and cancer death has also declined in a humble step of treatment such as anti-@@ cancer drugs .
It is also true that the number of patients with dementia is increasing .
It is not something that can be resolved by a person or family , but it is necessary to create an environment where people can live in peace of mind as a whole .
How to keep it in the degree of " forget "
Is there a person who is easy to become dementia ?
Even if it is inevitable to become a sense of dementia , it is possible that it can be kept in the degree of " forgotten " by sup@@ pressing the s@@ lag .
dementia is thought to be one of the life@@ sty@@ le-@@ related diseases and tends to be easier for people .
First , people tend to be able to become dementia .
dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle diseases .
It is a combination of obesity , high blood pressure , sugar disease , ur@@ inary disease , and hyper@@ vis@@ cos@@ ity .
It also affects economic strength .
There is a region where food tickets are distributed to the poor , but the food that can be made with food tickets is available in the safe cold bur@@ gers and pil@@ ers .
It is not possible to use gas and electricity , and it is possible for people living in the environment where food cannot be enjoyed .
As a result , it becomes a diet that has fewer vegetables and meat , and it becomes a living in fat and sugar .
Although it is poor , it becomes obesity , and if you think about doing it , you can only see the TV , but the body is not allowed .
It is possible to have similar situations in Japan .
Other people who do not think about things , work or work tend to be more prone to dementia .
In order to prevent dementia , it is necessary to read books and think about things from everyday age .
