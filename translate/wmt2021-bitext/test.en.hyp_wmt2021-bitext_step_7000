List of young male ped@@ al accidents ( A@@ ut@@ o M@@ e@@ s@@ e web )
Traffic Act
It has been noted that there are more news reports of accidents due to mis@@ conduct , such as ped@@ al failure , but it is a big mistake that I think it is a problem with elderly drivers .
In the case of the death of an accident in the second half of the year ( 2015 alarm data ) , the majority of the 10@@ 80 cases below 24 years were due to the above 10@@ 2 cases over 7@@ 5 .
It is important for the younger generation to call attention rather than the elderly .
do you want to take the o@@ sh@@ ale ?
are you safe ?
There is no male or cause in this data , but it is a difference between the elderly who are often thought to be from the decline of their bodies , such as the skills of driving and anti-@@ fire .
There are women who choose a variety of shoes by their clothes , such as the pu@@ ffs , the sand@@ als , Mu@@ ir , and the dress of the day .
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving , but there are many people who do not consider the possibility of a danger , or are driving without hesitation .
However , the driving of the rail@@ roads and sand@@ als is used for road traffic .
One is to ensure " Hand@@ les , brake , and other operations , " and " to ensure the safety violation " of Article 70 . "
The other thing is that the driver must abide by the provisions of the Japan Public Safety Board ( Section 1 ) , Section 12 , and the Oper@@ ational Control Act of Japan .
It is similar to the fact that even if they don 't speak with each prefecture , they are in violation of the driving operation .
why is it dangerous ?
It is white if it is thought of as a basis for ped@@ al control .
To ensure a safe ped@@ al operation , first put a foot on the floor and hold a leg to the brake ped@@ al , and then take the right side at the time of the ped@@ al .
At this time , it is important to be firmly fixed so that Kur@@ uma is not involved in action .
However , it is small enough to have a ground on the floor , so that it will be adjusted to the ped@@ al side because it is too small to fit into the ground , so that the legs will not be small .
This may lead to danger .
In addition , most of the cars are covered by Flo@@ a Car@@ pen@@ t , but this material makes it possible for this material to make sure that the he@@ el is not a ped@@ al , or a cow@@ l .
In addition , some cases have been that the he@@ el had left behind the ped@@ al ped@@ al and had no ped@@ al back .

what kind of system is it ?
Kobayashi : The profession now has many young people 's admiration .
It is also the top priority for the students who want to pay for the future , and will continue to grow more and more and more young people .
Until now , we have adopted a young man who has been following our dreams , such as the bar@@ d@@ man and the S@@ aints .
In the same way , it is a " fu@@ ze " to adopt a young man who is chasing a dream of becoming a fake .
There is an image that individuals would voluntarily upload videos , but why did they think they would be " adopted ? "
Kobayashi : While many young people are admired by their profession , there is a reality in which most of them are unable to give up their profits .
There are few creators who are making and publishing videos , and those who do not recognize the existence of a family .
In this effort , we will provide the environment for the use of the selected creators for the use of the cost and the construction of the Con@@ stance .
At first , we are trying to support our activities by supporting our efforts by providing our support for the dec@@ em@@ it@@ t of our profession , which has become un@@ stable .

The new telephone company 's new charge plan , which resulted in the implementation of the T@@ elecommunications Business Act .
However , it became a surprise .
In the summer of last year , he said , " There was about 4 % lower land , " and he had no expectations for him .
It is a major reason for the continuation of three major companies .
For consumers , it is a fair competition that makes it easier to use .
I want to ask for the efforts of each cell .
The Act of Amend@@ ment prohi@@ bits se@@ gregation of the terminals and communications fees .
Instead of selling the terminal 's ten@@ ure , the communication fee was set to be high .
The soft bank and the play were announced plans to maximize the terminals .
Both companies , however , have a system that can 't be used by other companies for ten days .
The C@@ lev@@ eland Company is the largest of three separate terminals for only their subscribers .
The three companies also appear to continue their " enclosed " to prevent them from multipl@@ ying .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs indicated the policy of requesting an immediate release .
The company needs to respond quickly .
The delay was due to the lack of a network of communications including the base office .
It was hoped that it would be the bom@@ ber of the race , but it would be a good idea .
did you see that ?
There is no clear timing or fee for real service .
As a company to travel to the social in@@ fr@@ a , I want to work with the company with blame .
This change of fees led to a speech by Secretary of S@@ cou@@ ch .
He complained about three new fees : " I think competition will start . "
However , it is not possible for the city to over@@ throw the city , and to encourage all competition .
The company should have deployed the customer 's main competition before it comes to government .
The pricing system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare .
When the terminals were adverti@@ sed , the consumer 's seat called attention .
It must be hard to explain to the company himself , in order to avoid the mis@@ solution of users .

Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are responsible for research and development .

I 've heard about the students of the hospital at the nearby K@@ ind@@ ai University Hospital in the brain center of the hospital .

Pro@@ hibition of dementia and the treatment is expected , but what is it ?
It is possible that the difference between t@@ ing@@ us and the severity of the difference is that if anyone is older , they may become cognitive .
However , it is thought that the new drug is developed over 20 years .
In some countries around the world , the drugs used in Japan have already been in@@ sured by insurance and cannot be expected .
