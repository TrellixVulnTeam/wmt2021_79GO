Tetsu@@ ya AS@@ ANO ( 4 ) and Hide@@ yuki T@@ AM@@ AT@@ SU ( 5 ) - To@@ shim@@ asa TO@@ DA 's district is located in the Su@@ e@@ kawa district .
The winner of the previous year was To@@ fu@@ -@@ w@@ az@@ iy@@ asan , and he was defeated by As@@ ano , who was the eigh@@ ty best player in the tournament .
Mas@@ ay@@ asu SH@@ IN@@ OK@@ ATA , the youngest member of the tournament , was defeated in the district of Ko@@ ichi@@ -@@ dai , which was the first half of the previous year .
he 's been defeated by a couple years ago .
On the 28th , the final is the final match for the whole road from 1 : 30 p.m. .
From 1 : 00 a.m. to the second sixth , the I@@ go school I@@ go Championship is held .
The venue is in all cases .
( This is called nak@@ amura kou@@ ri )
in the first half of the race , the world 's champion , and the best of luck is the lead .
male : A single player
The representative of Japan , who won six M@@ end@@ ar at the b@@ admin@@ ton big event held in August and the 25@@ 5th World Championship , won the first half of September , and the next day of the day of the new year .
In this case , a male and a b@@ admin@@ ton is displayed at the beginning of the first battle between May and August , when the next year 's Tokyo gor@@ yu began to appear .
The b@@ admin@@ ton gor@@ ges started in May , and the top player entered the tournament at the end of the world champion@@ ships ( 500 or more ) four tournaments .
In the first half of the battle , it was probably two of them , including K@@ out@@ on , who won the 4th tournament , and K@@ ub@@ an in Taiwan .
In the world champion@@ ships , K@@ obu won the tournament in which a high point of ' world points ' is directly connected to the race .
In addition to that , the company also has the same meaning as the S@@ 7@@ 50 .
In May , the tournament held in the Battle of Japan ( May / China ) is held in the world champion@@ ships , and the tournament is held in Japan in August .
Compared to other top players , the number is small , but it is a schedule to keep the burden on the body .
In August , only one tournament in the world champion@@ ships was held , and it would not be much more tired than that .
After September , the top tournament of the tournament is required to have a good results in a series of battles .
The ace of Taiwan , which is strong , is an ace .
attention to the young tit@@ ans !
In the same way , R@@ eng@@ aku won the top tournament in Indonesia and T@@ aim@@ e 500 , and entered the seventh tournament in Su@@ gi@@ ku .
In September , he also participated in the local Ta@@ is@@ haku ( S@@ 300 ) and won the show .
Originally , the player who had strong fi@@ gi@@ l was a player who didn 't suffer .
Even after the tournament , there is no big problem with the performance of the match .
It would be easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament in the future by getting high points in the first half .
Until the last year , U@@ chi@@ wa had the impression of the explosion , but by this year , the stability of the play was increased , it became possible to continue a strong performance .
The number one in the world ranking seems to be more than ever .
In addition to these two players , the results of the first half of the battle were left by young people in Thailand , Ay@@ asu and I@@ e B@@ b in India .
and as the euro@@ pe@@ an army , he was the three players of An@@ dar@@ us ant@@ on .
Although it is not going to the final at the top of the tournament , it has the power to move forward to the top of the game , such as entering the second tournament .
Although there are still some rough faces , there is a possibility that lar@@ ry could be seen in the top player on the other day of the race at the age of 20 .
In addition , U@@ chi@@ wa B@@ . took a step out of India in which a single player is available .
we need to pay attention to the in@@ dian army after the war as well as the thr@@ ills of pr@@ an@@ os h@@ .@@ s and k@@ eg@@ a .

The soft bank and the ro@@ ok@@ ie were announced on the plan to maximize the number of devices .
However , for 100 days in both countries , it is a system of ' k@@ uro , ' which cannot be used by other companies .
On the other hand , the number of te@@ pp@@ o is the largest of the number of devices on the table .
It is shown that the three companies continue to ' enc@@ ir@@ clo@@ pedia ' to prevent people from riding in .
In addition , the Ministry of Internal Affairs pointed out the policy of requesting immediate dis@@ miss@@ al .

is that it ?
It is not clear when full-@@ fledged service is started .
i 'd like you to work on a business project with an accus@@ ation .
In this case , the change of the fee was triggered by a statement by the director of Kan@@ sho@@ ten .
The Kan@@ sho@@ ji showed the dis@@ satisfaction of saying , ' I think the competition will start . '

Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are competing for research and development .
However , the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is becoming clear , and it is also known that there is a possibility that it can be forgotten about the truth .
i 've been talking to the chief ab@@ bot of the university hospital .
you don 't have dementia .
but what is it ?
the difference between the two and the worst is that it 's possible for everyone to become dementia .
but it 's still going to take more than 20 years to develop new cognitive drugs .
In some countries around the world , drugs called ' k@@ osa ' often used in Japan , they are already out@@ fitted for insurance , and they are not expected to be completed .
On the other hand , while the death of infections and accidents decreased , people can live longer while the cancer has been reduced due to the drastic decrease in treatment for cancer .
so it 's true that there are more dementia patients .
it 's not something that can be solved by hon@@ ors and family , but it needs to be maintained in the region .
how to put things away
is there someone who can easily become a dementia ?
even if you can 't avoid becoming dementia , you may be able to keep the symptoms as long as you can .
dementia is considered to be one of the habits of life and tends to be better .
the first of all , it tends to become dementia .
dementia is regarded as a kind of lifestyle disease .
it 's a combination of ob@@ ese , high blood pressure , sugar , urine , and high chol@@ era blood .
there 's no economic power .
in the united states , there is a place where people put a ticket called a food ticket to the poor , but the food on the hood ticket is a cold ham@@ burger .
we can 't use g@@ asses or electricity , and we can use people living in an environment that can 't cook .
i 'm going to have a small amount of food and vegetables and pork quality , and i 'm going to live in fat and sugar .
but if you think it 's poverty , it 's ob@@ ese , but if you do it , you just have to look at the tv , and your body is un@@ selfish .
similar situations can be seen in japan .
and those who don 't think about things tend to become dementia .
we need to read books and think about things .
